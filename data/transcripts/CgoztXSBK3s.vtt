00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as an elementary school
 
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
teacher a general special education
 
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
teacher a reading and writing specialist
 
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and an emotional behavioral
 
00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
specialist I also served um uh I ran my
 
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
own business I ended up doing at pro
 
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
bono as a special education advocate for
 
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
parents who were um not having feeling
 
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
their children's needs needs were not
 
00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
being met and this is what was the
 
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
Catalyst to this bill it my
 
00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
experiences so what I did was everyone
 
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
should have a packet on I put one on
 
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's desk and I thought rather
 
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
than giving a speech I'm just going to
 
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
speak from the heart and try and get you
 
00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
to understand my mindset in why I
 
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
brought this forward um and if you look
 
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
at the first part in Roman numeral 1 you
 
00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
will see that the words I added are much
 
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.950 align:start position:0%
will see that the words I added are much
more

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
descriptive of the definition of what
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
literacy is and if we understand
 
00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 align:start position:0%
literacy um components includes Reading
 
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
Writing math listening skills um and
 
00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
everything that has to do with
 
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
communication one of the um challenges
 
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I found
 
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
was when we talk about phonics a lot of
 
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
people just think about decoding and
 
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
learning to read but phonics has two
 
00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
components it also includes encoding
 
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
which means spelling that is not being
 
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
Tau in our New Hampshire schools anymore
 
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
they stopped teaching that in about
 
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
2017 when you look a little bit further
 
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
down I also included when we talk about
 
00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
writing writing is not meaning that you
 
00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
can actually form the words but that you
 
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
can actually write um in a coherent way
 
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
using appropriate grammar and
 
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
mechanics most schools stopped teaching
 
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
that around
 
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
2012 2015 somewhere in that area I
 
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
remember a language arts te teacher came
 
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
to me and said oh my God I'm not allowed
 
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
to teach parts of speech anymore well if
 
00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 align:start position:0%
you can't teach parts of speech how do
 
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
you teach a child where to put the comma
 
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
how do you teach them to understand what
 
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
an introductory phrase is how do you get
 
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 align:start position:0%
them to actually build a coherent
 
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
constructive response which is a way of
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
writing that every child should know how
 
00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 align:start position:0%
to do it's something I really in special
 
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
education that was where I put my focus
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
because if a child can write a
 
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
constructive response if they can start
 
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
with a general idea bring it down to
 
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
three main ideas the next three
 
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 align:start position:0%
paragraphs you you expand on those three
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
ideas and then you repeat your
 
00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 align:start position:0%
introduction that's a five paragraph
 
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
essay that is what is required from
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
every child if they can do that they can
 
00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 align:start position:0%
do anything in writing they can fill out
 
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
an application because they know how to
 
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
do a constructed response to tell people
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
what they're what they're
 
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
um uh what they're bringing to the table
 
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
you know and and it just it works in
 
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
every aspect of writing and every aspect
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
of where we have to stand up and talk
 
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.390 align:start position:0%
of where we have to stand up and talk
for

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
ourselves so this is why I added that I
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
want to move forward before going on to
 
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 if you go to the next
 
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
page so as and I'll just back up one
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
minute as a special educator when I read
 
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
this an immediate flag went off in my
 
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
head because I'm like well this is
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
special education these are our
 
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
components of
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
literacy so if you go to the next and
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
this is what I'm talking about so as
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
part of my job as a special educator I
 
00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
had to do the academic assessments with
 
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
children to determine whether or not
 
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
they met the criteria as a student with
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
a disability I use the y84 we also have
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
the Woodcock Johnson but they all cover
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
the same thing and if you look on the
 
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
back of page where it says wow You'll
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
see all the components that I would
 
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
check that I had to assess a child in
 
00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
those components included
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
spelling they include essay composition
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
your five paragraph essay it's required
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
they expect you to see it in a
 
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
constructed response format if you look
 
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
further down you will see all of the
 
00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
other um components the oral expression
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
um being able to speak coherently um all
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
of these things but we're not teaching
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%
them anymore so now we're taking
 
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
children we're identifying them or not
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
we're taking them as a referral and
 
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying let's do an
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation well how am I how is that
 
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation even valid If the child never
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
learned the skills so now I'm going to
 
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
refer children because they never
 
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
learned they were never even given the
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn a skill as opposed
 
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
to they can't learn it and so that's a
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
big problem and I saw that all along the
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
way the next um piece that I brought you
 
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if anyone has ever seen
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
but a specific learning disability this
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
is the deliberation form I took off the
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
district's name there but all the
 
00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
districts use the same this is a
 
00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
districts use the same this is a
Statewide

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
form so if you look through it and you
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
go to the second page of it you will see
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
does the child achieve adequately for
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
his age or meet the stage the state
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
approved grade level uh standards and
 
00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
look what's there all of those same
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
things that's the Wyatt there's all
 
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
those components that's where I put does
 
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
the child know how to spell does the
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
child know how to uh write these are all
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
the components if they can't do
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
that they may well be eligible as a um
 
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
or qualify as a special education
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
student then they may need then we'll
 
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
determine if they need specialized
 
00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.309 align:start position:0%
determine if they need specialized
instruction

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
instruction the other page that I wanted
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
you to see and this is even more
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
concerning to me is then you go over to
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh the next page where it starts is
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
there a visual or a hearing well we
 
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
always rule that out first but then you
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
have to say if it's an intellectual
 
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
disability so if the child has under a
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
70 IQ then we're looking at a
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled and so they
 
00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
will not qual they don't qualify under a
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability but here I
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
worked with children with emotional
 
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
disturbance and I'm going to tell you
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
that in many cases children that are
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
just demonstrating uh behaviors in the
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
classroom are demonstrating those
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
behaviors because they can't read not
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
because they are emotionally disabled
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
instead it is because they are
 
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
frustrated this is a component of
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
Dyslexia the frustration the anxiety
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
imagine sitting in a classroom for six
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
hours a day while you're a teacher and
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
everyone else spoke in Latin or some
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
other foreign language that you can
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
understand it when they tell you it but
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
you can't read it you can't write it so
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
you act out because you don't want your
 
00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
other classmates to see that you don't
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
know how to do these
 
00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:03.830 align:start position:0%
know how to do these
skills

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
skills
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
so then you go down a little bit further
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
and it's going to ask if there was any
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
um sorry it's on the next page I believe
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
but it's going to say does it have any
 
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.230 align:start position:0%
but it's going to say does it have any
medical

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
findings well here's where your children
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
with other health impairment that's
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
where they're going to fall so if you
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
have these same children that you're
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
saying well they're ADH day well here's
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
another component of dyslexia it
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
presents as ADHD again the child becomes
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
antsy they become anxious they become
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
frustrated they start acting out they
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
can't sit still well of course because
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
they can't read and so I've seen more
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
children identified in as emotional
 
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
disabled or as an other health
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
impairment when in fact they were not
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
misidentified so on my next page I gave
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
the latest it's a 2022 is how our
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire that have
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities how that spreads out in
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
each of the areas and you can see that
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
SD specific learning disability has
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
10,000 students as of
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
2022 so that's onethird of the total of
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
30,000 but I also pointed out the other
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
health impairment and you can see there
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
how many are there and they could be
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
there because they can't read not
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
because of a an actual Health impairment
 
00:08:31.149 --> 00:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
that would be getting in their way of of
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
learning to read you could see in in
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
emotional disturbance as well how the
 
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:36.919 align:start position:0%
numbers go
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
up on the first part in the First Column
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
is where the grades are and this is
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
where I looked because I marked them out
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
for kindergarten 1 second third and
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
fourth grade and then you can say
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
typically um age 10 you're in fifth
 
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
grade in some schools that's a middle
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
school some it's still in an elementary
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
school but if you look at the numbers
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
look how they pop
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
to 1200 in specific learning
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities that they're being
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
identified in fifth grade there'll be
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
even more identified in sixth grade this
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
is Middle School what have these
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
children been doing for the last five or
 
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
six years they have not been accessing
 
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.230 align:start position:0%
six years they have not been accessing
the

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum they have been falling
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
further and further
 
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
behind this is extremely concerning to
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
me which is why I came to the conclusion
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
and I started telling people there seems
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
to be a rule of thumb and I'm going to
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
be honest it's not that there seems to
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
be there is an Unwritten rule of thumb
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
that until the child is two years behind
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
we will not
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate because we're waiting for some
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
other intervention to see if it will
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
work I can tell you that with all
 
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
certainty because for eight years I sat
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
in IEP meetings with children who were
 
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.150 align:start position:0%
in IEP meetings with children who were
being

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
tested and we would know unless they're
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
two years behind we're not moving
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
forward we have to first try all other
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
interventions that was eight years as a
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
teacher I also sat in IEP meetings four
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
years as a school
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
coordinator and I
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
knew we do not identify we do not move
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
ahead until those children are two years
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
behind then we will I will um evaluate
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's not written
 
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere I'm telling you that as an
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
observed when I move
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
on so when I refer to the two years this
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
is where it's coming from I'm putting
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
the data together and these are all the
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
things I'm trying to again I'm trying to
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
give you my thought process over these
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
years my next now this kind of is going
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
to now start going into to Roman numeral
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
2 and that's where I started talking
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
about the general education tier 2
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
intervention the
 
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:11.959 align:start position:0%
referrals um that if they're not meeting
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
grade expectations that they need to be
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
referred for intervention
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
immediately or at least when they're
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrating six months below their
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's half a year already teachers know
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
when the child is not staying up with
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the classroom
 
00:11:33.069 --> 00:11:33.079 align:start position:0%
I use the term in here on Roman numeral
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
to students who do not make meaningful
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
gains meaningful gains comes directly
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
out of the special education law and I
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
specifically use that term because we're
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
not looking for progress and I'm what
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing now is the general education
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
is starting to try and take pages from
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
the special education that's why we do
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum based assessment if you look
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
at how we assess special education
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
students now the general education is
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
being done the same way well the same
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
should hold true with what we're
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
expecting in intervention meaningful
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
gains means the Gap has to be getting
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
smaller it can't just mean progress it
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
can't just mean they did six last time
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
and they did seven this time it means
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes they did six this time but their
 
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
class has moved ahead further so we need
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
to see them doing eight nine we need to
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
see the Gap getting smaller
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
between where they are and where their
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
gains that section there is the Catalyst
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
that understanding of my frustration
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
that intervention is only supposed to go
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
for 6 to eight weeks it is not supposed
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
to be going a year or two years they
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
should be implementing a good
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
scientifically based program in
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
intervention and we should be able to
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
see right away if the progress or the
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
meaningful gains are being made and if
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
that intervention is working and if it's
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
not working we need to try something
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
different and if it's still not working
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
that child must be referred to special
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
education for an evaluation we can't
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
wait we don't have time everyone knows
 
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
if a child is not reading at grade level
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
by grade
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
three the likelihood that they ever will
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
be at the same grade level as their as
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
their peers is very small and it's not
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
just about reading it's about all of the
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
that is what made me write to our
 
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.470 align:start position:0%
that is what made me write to our
education

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner and I specifically I was on
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
the phone with him for about a half hour
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
going over this what is going on with
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
this two-year rule of thumb that nobody
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
seems to want to acknowledge but is
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
happening in our state and he sent it
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
off to um Rebecca fet who I guess is in
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
charge of all of the special education
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
and and I highlighted because the
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
districts are left with the ability to
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
set guidelines for their reading
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
referrals and evaluations they vary from
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
District to
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
District well if if our guidelines vary
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
from District to District how are our
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students getting fape how
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
are they getting a free appropriate
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
public education if they get one thing
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
in one district and another thing in
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
another District that is not Equitable
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
fair and it's it just undermines the
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
student so she referred to oh well Lori
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
must be referring to another section so
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
on your next page here's the other
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
section I'm referring to the IEP shall
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
um te I'm sorry the IEP team shall
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
within 15 days of the referral determine
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
this is the problem area determine
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether concerns raised by the referral
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
can be addressed using existing
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
pupil support services available to all
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
children that's tier
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
two but there's no there's no nothing in
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
there that says for how long so we have
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
children languishing and half the time
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're in that intervention the teacher
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
is doing Running Records she's not even
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
teaching in the one the children that
 
00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
I've seen that are in intervention
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
they're not even using an actual program
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
they're just teaching what's in the
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
classroom slower or they're just making
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
the stuff up themselves there is nothing
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
that the child is getting so the child
 
00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:37.839 align:start position:0%
stays there and languishes and Falls
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
further and farther
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
behind and I'm not saying that happens
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere some interventions are done
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
appropriately they're done quickly and
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
they work but in the cases where they're
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
not working we need to have a deadline
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
we need to say hey if after 6 months
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
that child is not making meaningful
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
gains they must before they fall two
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
years behind they must go to a special
 
00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
years behind they must go to a special
education

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
referral my last piece of
 
00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:05.309 align:start position:0%
referral my last piece of
evidence

00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
stand behind everything I just said and
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
this comes from the United States
 
00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.350 align:start position:0%
this comes from the United States
education

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
department and I highlighted the area
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
where it says that it is critical that
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
identification occur in a timely manner
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
two years is not timely six to eight
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
weeks I guess could be timely if it's
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
done correctly it certainly should not
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
that it goes on to say that RTI response
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
to intervention that's the tier 2
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
intervention cannot be used to delay a
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
referral or an
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation they could be moving forward
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
with an evaluation half the time even
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
more than half the time the first thing
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
we do is check the vision in the
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
screening so so while that child is in
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
the intervention we could still be in
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
the process of determining if we're
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with the
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation or have them in the in the
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
queue for getting evaluated to save some
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
time we have 60 or 90 days to get all of
 
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:13.789 align:start position:0%
time we have 60 or 90 days to get all of
that

00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
done but this is what I feel is
 
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
happening I don't think that um changing
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
this would cost the district's money I
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
have heard some people say this is going
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
to be more expensive if we have to do
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
intervention and my response to that is
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
if you do the intervention sooner it
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
will cost you less because if you go
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
back to when children are being
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
identified in middle school if you look
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
at all of these numbers in order for
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
these children to be able to learn in
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
middle school they are going to have to
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
have a parot in their class they're
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to have some type of a par
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
professional helping them to access the
 
00:17:58.029 --> 00:17:58.039 align:start position:0%
curriculum while they're in the
 
00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
classroom room if we did this sooner if
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
we had this done by the time the child
 
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
is in third fourth grade and we know now
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
they're reading all of these extra
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
services that are required in the Middle
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
School would no longer be required
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
because that child is now accessing the
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum so in actuality it would cost
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
the districts Less in the wrong in the
 
00:18:19.159 --> 00:18:20.990 align:start position:0%
the districts Less in the wrong in the
long

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
run and that's where my experience has
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
told me and that is why I brought this
 
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.230 align:start position:0%
told me and that is why I brought this

you thank you representative questions
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh from committee members uh
 
00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
uh from committee members uh
representative

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
lakus I'm wondering would this cause do
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
you think more kids identified as
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
um do you think that it might lead to
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
over um categorizing them I do not think
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
that because my experience has been the
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
interventions that I gave in my special
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
education classroom were typically tier
 
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.270 align:start position:0%
education classroom were typically tier
2

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
interventions only very few amount of
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
children need that very intense reading
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
intervention um most good reading
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
programs if you look at the Wilson
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
Reading Program they have the General ad
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
the tier two and the tier three which
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
would be the um special ad that would be
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
a very intensive
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
program but these other tier 2 ones they
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
can be implemented right in the
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
classroom to be honest with you they
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
could be implemented with the whole
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
class they don't need to be brought out
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
to have these things um these skills
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
taught to them it could be integrated
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
right within the um the curriculum
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's being taught within the general
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
education classroom so I don't
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
think it would cause more special aded
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
what I would hope it would do is cause
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
when the children do go into
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
intervention that the interventions they
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
receive are going to be scientifically
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
based intervention programs that these
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
children are getting which is not what I
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
have seen when I've gone to District um
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
different districts as a special
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
education Advocate when I ask to see
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
what they're doing in intervention what
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
they show me is
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
appalling um so I would hope that it
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
would at least put something more if the
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
child does have to leave the classroom
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
for a tier 2 intervention that they
 
00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:34.360 align:start position:0%
would be getting a legitimate tier 2
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
intervention thank you further questions
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall Mr chair thank
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and along the
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
same line as representative lakas do we
 
00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
have a sense of how many kids percentage
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
identified I don't have a specific
 
00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
number but I can tell you my EXP
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
experience besides as a special um
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
education Advocate I can tell you my
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
experience with my own family members
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
have been that they have I knew that
 
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
there was a problem when they were in
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and they are still both in
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
second grade they were finally referred
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
to special education we still are
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
waiting because it will not be done
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
until June and I will tell you that I
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
will have them on grade level before
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
they get evaluated because I tutor them
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
using appropriate scientifically based
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
programs the will
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
program thank
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning and thank you for
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward um I appreciate
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
the uh depth of material sincerely uh
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
having been uh sitting where you are uh
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
talking about this issue
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
uh is there
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
any way or any reason why the department
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
now I'm talking the DOE
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh that I mean rea fet the chair or the
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
department chair um coming out of doe
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh provide guidelines uh for I I
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
read about your twoe two-year lag piece
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
here from the commissioner and and sort
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
of just passing the ball while Local
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
Schools but it seemed to me that I I
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
agree with you first off okay but it
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that that if we wanted to
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
get all schools on board uh within the
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
State uh without a RSA just for
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
practical purpose the way it should be
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
um that there would be things coming out
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner's office have you
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
had any discussion with them have there
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
been any I've never seen any technical
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
advisories on this or early
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
interventions in terms of
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh perhaps uh doctor has
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
over there seen that but do you know of
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
any of this come out or why they haven't
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
come out I could tell you that when I
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
talked to the commissioner when I spoke
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
with him he was not aware that this was
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
happening and as you can see by the
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
response it's still just up to local
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
control I think the um commissioner and
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
the department is just going by this is
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
what the federal law is but just because
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
it's a federal law doesn't mean that we
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
as a state can't tighten it up and I I
 
00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:15.549 align:start position:0%
as a state can't tighten it up and I I
just

00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
um I think the O in my mind the only way
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
to do it is going to be by creating an
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
RSA and making sure that every district
 
00:23:25.149 --> 00:23:25.159 align:start position:0%
is doing the same from District to
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
District especially given how transient
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
are Society is
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
today represent cell have follow up
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you just to follow
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
up on that I'm looking at the data your
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
documentation I understand the the
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
federal is two decades ago but the our
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
your response from the commissioner and
 
00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:46.279 align:start position:0%
from uh Rebecca fad is 22 is two years
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
ago basically almost now have you seen
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
any movement from the commissioner or
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
from the Department of special education
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
to address this issue in few years I
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
have not I originally talked to him last
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
year this bill was going to come forward
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
last year and I pulled it because of
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
another similar bill that was coming and
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
so I pulled it and moving forward um as
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
far as the the 2011 bill or the letter
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
that is still in effect and I double
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
checked because where I found that
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
referenced and to be totally transparent
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
this did not come because I was educated
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
to be a teacher in New Hampshire or
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
because I was told this by a district um
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
I found in the
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um because my sister is also
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
a teacher down there and in their policy
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
handbook it's actually noted right in
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
their handbook and it is still today
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
noted so nothing in that this changes
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
this still valid ID prescription hasn't
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
changed but right I was just thinking
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
since you made the commissioner and the
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
department especially aware that we
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
thought maybe they might have done
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
something at two years thank you R
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
Corell if I could just I did the two
 
00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
years ago but I have not seen any Chang
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's not a surprise thank you yes are
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
there any further uh questions from the
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative go ahead Paul go
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
new go ahead Paul thank you thank you Mr
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
chairman uh given uh the two broad
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
sections here uh that are you have
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
sought to either amend or to uh to add
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
new material with respect particular to
 
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 2 and
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
um the uh length of your testimony let
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
me just say for the record since I'm new
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
to this committee how I uh how I miss
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the rules of the United States uh
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives where
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
representatives are given an allotted
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
time to ask a series of questions
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
because the the the breadth of the
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
material that you have spoken to today
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
prompts about 700 question questions
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
before you stopped otherwise it would
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
have been 8 or 900 so um I need to limit
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
myself to one question and I will do so
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
by asking you and and this is tough
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
because I I just got one and maybe a
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
followup let me ask you
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
um with the backdrop to my question
 
00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
being that my grandson who's eight years
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
old comes to visit us he's a very bright
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
child and we're trying to read with this
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
child and this child has no idea how to
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
sound out a word he has never seen
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
before and therefore he hates reading
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
right and the testimony that was given
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
to me by our local school superintendent
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the effect that the school has appied
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
for a Federal grant to teach teachers
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
how to teach phonics so that they can
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
teach high school students remedial
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
reading before they
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
graduate how about that let me ask you
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
this question what percentage of the
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
students that you are seeing with
 
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
students that you are seeing with
reading

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
difficulties would you say are having
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties because of the manner and
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
the the method in which they are being
 
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.710 align:start position:0%
the the method in which they are being
taught

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
100% so that would be my answer um I
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
spoke to interestingly enough it was
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
another teacher from uh nashwa and she
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
was very excited to hear about my bill
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
because what it came down to is in
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
2014 is when fontas and panel
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
was shoved down our throats that's the
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
only way I can put it I excuse me for
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
being rude it was literally shoved down
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
our throats as teachers and we rebelled
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
and we said this will not work for half
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
of our students but it didn't matter the
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
decision was made the curriculum was
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
purchased and we had to go with it
 
00:27:48.509 --> 00:27:48.519 align:start position:0%
luckily I'm special Ed so I could do my
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
own thing but the general education
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
teachers were forced to Now teach by
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
memory no more phonics no more grammar
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
no more spelling no more decoding
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
that was the downfall in 2014 the
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
science of reading has been around for
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
decades I was going to bring another
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
piece of evidence in 2010 I actually put
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
together a three pamphlet
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
folder folder whatever three pamphlet um
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
that I did in 2010 about the five
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
components of a good
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
reading um curriculum we were required
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
to do that as part of my graduate work
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and it was all the phonics phonemics
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
awareness fluency
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
comprehension that's nothing new they
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
call it the science of reading like it's
 
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
something new it's not new it has always
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
been here it's how most children learn
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
to read or I'll say at least 50% of them
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
learn to read now the difference is
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
children who can learn by the fontis and
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
panel method of
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
memorization they will only benefit even
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
more by learning the phonics and
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
learning to see the
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
um the patterns and why words are the
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
way written the way they're written or
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
spelled the way they're spelled but for
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
children who need that explicit
 
00:29:11.509 --> 00:29:11.519 align:start position:0%
instruction who need to be told who need
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
to be shown and taught the patterns
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
they're never going to learn through the
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
memorization and that's the crime here
 
00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
is that we went to a method that does
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
not work for all of our students all
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
students can learn through phonics but
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
only half can learn through memorization
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
and the worst thing is the fontis and
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
panel program tried to use some of the
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
um strategies that we would use as a
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
special educator to try and help
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
children while you're learning your
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
phonics well let's look at how the
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
sentence how does it fall let's see if
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
we can find some Clues but it wasn't
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the way you taught
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
reading that was just one little
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
component of trying to help students use
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
other methods
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
um the concern I have is is that the
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
majority of children with dyslexia are
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
average to above average
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
IQ so that means they are excellent at
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
finding compensating skills they're
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
excellent at flying under the radar
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's why so many of them are
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
identified in middle school it is the
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
worst thing to sit in a in a IEP meeting
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
with parents of a child in seventh or
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
eighth grade and tell them your child
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
has a reading disability and they're
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
like what now you're going to tell me
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
this now well because your child was
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
always able to memorize one syllable and
 
00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:40.039 align:start position:0%
two syllable words but we're now more
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
sophisticated in the middle school and
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
going into high school we have multi-
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
syllabic words three and four syllables
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
and your child does not know how to
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
attack those words they can't sound them
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
out give a follow quick follow up thank
 
00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr in your view what happened
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
in the runup to and including 2014 such
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
new and improved quote unquote way of
 
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
learning or teaching reading was
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
implemented not as an additional tool
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
but the only tool a substitute for what
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
Millennia that's a hard question to
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
answer without being Politically
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
Incorrect but I can't to lose nothing
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
since I'm retired um UNH those programs
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
came out of people who went to
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
un but you know you don't know why we
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
know why well publication let's sell
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
more book we know why on that yeah uh
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
further further questions from the
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative Balon thank you
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
question I'm just going back to the bill
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
itself um on the uh on the part one it
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
says all school districts is there some
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
reason that you decided not to add
 
00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
reason that you decided not to add
Charter

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
Charter
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
Schools I just we certainly could amend
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
it to say that but all the school
 
00:32:10.149 --> 00:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
districts um I guess charter schools are
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
public schools within a district so it
 
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
would be covered as far as I can tell as
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
far as I know but that was not my
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
wording that was original wording of the
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
the way the bill stands today further
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
questions Yes again just going back to
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
the bill so there's really two two
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
segments that you're adding um one uh
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
provides a very specific definition of
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
what types of literacy and how it should
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
be taught um I also notice in the second
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
part is about the interventions
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
themselves so I'm wondering basically
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
this bill in one paragraphs just
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
mandates um evidence-based reading for
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
for all school districts um and taking
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
60 days taking effect 60 days after the
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
passage um there's no
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
if I look at the financial note I mean I
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm just thinking ahead um in order to
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
go about you're a teacher you know
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
anytime you change a particular type of
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
program there's a lot of professional
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
development around that needs to be done
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of support um and yet it can cost
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
districts an awful lot of money to
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
implement the program so I just would
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
like to have you speak to that thank
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
you the ran numeral one basically is a
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
definition of what New Hampshire would
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
consider as a literacy program the
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
components of a literacy program any
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
good reading program would have all of
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
these components and a math program
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
would have these components um in
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
them um as far as the professional
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
development I can tell you that we had
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
one day of professional development on
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
fontas and panel and then we were sent
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
off to go teach it as teachers we change
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
our curriculum all the time and we learn
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
we read the the teachers manual and we
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
follow it it's a scripted program or
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
that was um so that would be did I'm not
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
sure if I covered both your questions
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
fin question yeah the final one was just
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
the materials
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
cost um again most districts are now
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
moving away from the fontas nail program
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
and they're buying um programs or
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing programs that have more of
 
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
this phonics in it we just want to make
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
sure I would like to make sure that the
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
programs that they're purchasing that
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
they remember that uh phonics is both
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
encoding and decoding and writing
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
includes grammar and mechanics again
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
that's not something that you even need
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
much to if you're teaching reading all
 
00:34:43.629 --> 00:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
you do is ask teach children to also
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
spell the words there's not a lot of um
 
00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919 align:start position:0%
components to add to
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
this other questions from the committee
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent Hall then represent
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question did I
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
understand you earlier on that you said
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
schools do not teach five paragraph
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
writing and do not teach spelling now
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
and if if that's the case if if believe
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's the case did you check with all
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
school districts because I think that
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's I know my school district teaches
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
both of those I was told by someone in
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
Education that in 2017 most of the
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
districts stopped teaching spelling I
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
can tell you that when I look at what my
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
grandchildren bring home and they're in
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
kindergarten to um fourth grade I am not
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
seeing spelling any spelling list coming
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
home and we do not work on spelling we
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
work on site wordss so you got that from
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
the doe then yes I did the um and the
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
other the grammar mechanics if you look
 
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
back into the Fontes and penel it kind
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
of or in the Luc Lucy Hawkins um
 
00:35:49.829 --> 00:35:49.839 align:start position:0%
literacy which is another one that's
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
used for the writing it's really all
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
about getting children to write just
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
write just write just write but no one's
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
check checking to make sure that they're
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
writing coherently and so no I I do not
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you just to follow um in
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
doly in your experience uh have you seen
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
any connection between either the
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
addition of the lack of early parent
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
reading with children as regards their
 
00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
rating skill
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
development reading is a very
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
interesting um
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
because there's many components to it
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
there's visual spatial components um
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
children reversing
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
letters reading as a parent reading to a
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
child I can say I read to my children
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
every single night did that help them
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
learn to read no not necessarily because
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
that was all listening comprehension so
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
they have great listening comprehension
 
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
but whether or not they could read it is
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
those are two totally different types of
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
skills um and
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
honestly sometimes the whole idea of
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
reading by six is kind of a misnomer
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
because the brain has to make some
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
physiological changes before a child can
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
even read sometimes they are still
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
reversing putting their letters up and
 
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
down backwards different things they
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
have difficulty with but that's still
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
within the normal range if they're doing
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that at 8 years old it's still normal um
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
in a normal range so it's just something
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
that you just continue to work with and
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
eventually um you hope that's going to
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
work its way out and if it doesn't then
 
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
may be a visual spatial um disability
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
going on there thank you are there any
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee at
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
this time represent
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr Excuse me thank you
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
question so we have a written testimony
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
in front of us from a gentleman named
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
Tom newerk who identifies himself as a
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
professor Meritus at UNH and I won't go
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
into the details we we we're going to
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
have an individual by that name
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
testifying here great I would like to
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
hear representative Ball's response to
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
one of his remarks if I may so he
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
um speaks to the bill um requesting
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices through grade
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
five um and then highlights
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
two um parts that he does not consider
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
to be evidence-based so I'm just
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
interested in your perspective or
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
response both on phonic
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
he he supports phonic in I think what we
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
have to do is stop saying what he he is
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
here he will spoke speak for he um okay
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
so just ask a question could you speak
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
to what degree of evidence-based
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
information is there for phonics in
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
grades three through
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
five so this would go all the way back
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
to Orton Gillingham that's he's the
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
grandfather of all phonics programs
 
00:38:58.109 --> 00:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
every phonic program you will look at
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
will be based in Orton
 
00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:03.190 align:start position:0%
will be based in Orton
Gillingham

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
Gillingham
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
um Wilson Barbara Wilson was a student
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
of Orton Gillingham she created another
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
program and then to say it's not
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based would be kind of crazy
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
because we're going all the way
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
back decades and decades I mean I'd have
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
to go back and remember exactly when
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
Orton Gillingham was um when he did that
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
but it was I get I'm mixed up with Maria
 
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.030 align:start position:0%
but it was I get I'm mixed up with Maria
montor

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
montor
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
um but that's years and years of
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
evidence showing that these systems work
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
and have always worked and that's why
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
it's still today so prevalent to hear
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
Orton Gillingham the only reason I don't
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
necess I know I've been trained in Orton
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
Gillingham I've been trained in um
 
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
Wilson I've been trained in Linda mod
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
Bell I've been trained in her lips
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
program I've done the DOL program so I
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
know all these different programs but
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
they all basically Bally come back to
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
the same five components of phonics and
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
if we can't say that decades and decades
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
is evidencebased I don't know what more
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
evidence we would need thank you very
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
much other further questions from the
 
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
very much for allowing me to present my
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh okay the next person up is uh
 
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:25.349 align:start position:0%
bill uh okay the next person up is uh
Tom

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:40.270 align:start position:0%
 
nuker

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
speak can you is your mic on push the
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
button yeah there you go I I always have
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
the trouble Schoolboard meetings I'm not
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
used to this system so um um I
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate this opportunity to talk on
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
um HB 1015 and I've limited my remarks
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
to about 3 minutes because I thought
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the the rule um my name
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
is Tom nuker I'm a professor emeritus
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
from the University of New Hampshire
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
I've also worked as an editor of books
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
for teachers that translate reading
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
comprehension Research into classroom
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
practice I have served for 11 years on
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
the oy River Cooperative School Board
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
though I speak here only for
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
myself I will speak in opposition to HB
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
1015 and I'll make just two
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
points um the bill mandates approaches
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
that are not I believe the bill mandates
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
approaches that are not themselves
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and this has been brought
 
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
up previously and I'll point to two the
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill requires explicit systematic
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
instruction in pheic awareness and
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
phonics through grade five and I think
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
this is highly problematic because if
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
you look at the national study research
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
panel on research study that came out in
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
around 2000 which is generally
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
considered the most comprehensive and
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
authoritative review of research the
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
evidence for phonic instruction in the
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
primary grades is strong as I think has
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
been pointed out the evidence Beyond
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
grade two is not strong it's that's not
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based practice according to
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
the National study will there be kids
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
students who might need that in remedial
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
situations absolutely but that's not
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
evidence-based the other point that's
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
not evidence-based is the instruction in
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
formal grammar for writing and of course
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
this depends on what you mean by grammar
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that's part the problem with this
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill is that a lot of these terms are
 
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
very nebulous and what does it mean to
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
teach grammar does it mean nouns and
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
verbs does it mean to to teach the cons
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
you know the formal construction of the
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
sentence but one of the facts in in um
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
writing research is it's been pretty
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
it's in clearly shown that taking time
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
to teach a lot of formal grammar to
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
teach formal structure of the sentence
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
does not translate into writing
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
instruction it of takes time away from
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
writing instruction because you're
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
teaching grammar instead of giving
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
students opportunity to write that goes
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
back to 1960 that's probably one of the
 
00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
most authoritative conclusions in
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
writing research okay so I would argue
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
that paradoxically a bill that demands
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice fails its own
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
standard that it fails its own standard
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
to be evidence-based at least in those
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
two areas and that should clearly be
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
changed if the spill goes
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
forward I want to speak more to section
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
two of the
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill section two of this bill creates an
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
unfunded Mandate of undetermined
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
proportion of undetermined
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
proportion it will fall most heavily on
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
poor school districts at least likely to
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
bear the
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
cost the bill will require a massive
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
number of referrals to level
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
two where students will get special
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
assistance perhaps from teachers but
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
teachers also have to teach the level
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
one but special assistance from AIDS par
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
professionals tutors and reading
 
00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:01.240 align:start position:0%
Specialists since of referral comes when
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
the child is 6 months behind in any
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
competency it's almost certain that will
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
be there will be referral rates of 60 70
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
80% the data on learning recovery after
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
the pandemic shows many districts
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
average more than a year behind grade
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
level in
 
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
math support systems will be
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed I'm not saying this is not a
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
need I'm just saying support systems
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
will be overwhelmed you will have chaos
 
00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
referrals it would have been prudent to
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
do some sort of stress test to predict
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
how this bill would affect local
 
00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
districts but in the methodology section
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is clear that no such attempt was
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
made there is the admission that this
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill may increase local expenditure by
 
00:44:56.349 --> 00:44:56.359 align:start position:0%
an indeterminable amount by an
 
00:44:59.150 --> 00:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
indeterminable amount in fiscal year
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
2025 and each year
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
thereafter in fact there is no way it
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
won't increase local expenditure by a
 
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.190 align:start position:0%
won't increase local expenditure by a
large

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
amount so three things are
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
clear in my
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
view the bill will place a financial
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
burden on local school districts to
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
provide level two support I can't see
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
that that won't happen from this
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.630 align:start position:0%
that that won't happen from this
bill

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
two no efforts have been made to
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
burden and three the bill provides no
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
additional State funds to cover these
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
costs I'm going to say those again
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay the bill will place a financial
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
burden on local school districts to
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
provide level two support that seems to
 
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.069 align:start position:0%
provide level two support that seems to
be

00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
incontrovertible two no efforts have
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
been made to determine the scale of this
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
burden and three the bill provides no
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
additional State funds to cover these
 
00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
costs in other words it is an unfunded
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
Mandate of indeterminate
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
scale I submit to the committee that
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
either of these problems the requirement
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
of practices that are not evidence-based
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
and the unfunded mandated places on
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
school districts should make it
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you thank you very much
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
much are questions from the committee
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative dry thank you Mr
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
question can you explain to me what a
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
stress test to test this would be look
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
to turned it
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
offed line okay um I would think you'd
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
want to go into a district and try to
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
use this metric of six
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
months and what so how many students
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
would that that require you to to
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
remediate to give some kind of level two
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
support then what kind of resources
 
00:47:05.549 --> 00:47:05.559 align:start position:0%
would you have to give that kind of
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
support now if
 
00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
if if for example like u in the the
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
recent New York Times They had they had
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
this big report on learning loss you
 
00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
know and so you had urban districts that
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
you had urban districts are a year
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
behind you know where the average was a
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
year behind in math say say start with
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
third grade math just for the sake of
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
argument okay in third grade math if you
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
had 80% of your students in some Urban
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
District performing six months
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
behind what resources for remediation
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
would it take to remediate 80% cting
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
80% of those
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
students I think would be enormous you
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
know I mean so you could you could you
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
could you could look and see what it
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
would take to do that given the the kind
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
um test scores you you have in these
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
districts and then then you could make
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
some kind of assessment of what the
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
impact would be the point I'm making is
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
for you to go forward with these kinds
 
00:48:11.309 --> 00:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
of rubric these kinds of structures
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
without knowing what effect it will have
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
on districts you're you're kind of like
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
going into the unknown in in a serious
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
way I'm sorry go ahead yeah follow up
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um have you taken into
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
consideration also that in some cases
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
this might actually be a quick fix for
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
some students and that it's not once
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
they get into tier 2 they're there
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
forever true may may actually remediate
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and be
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
done I think I think that's a
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
possibility I'm just thinking the sheer
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
the sheer number of referrals to handle
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
that uh and you you can say you know
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will be you know you know a
 
00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
quick fix but it might it might not some
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
KS might take more time I'm my point is
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
you should make some attempt to look at
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
the impact of what you're what you're
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
requiring of schools and and if you
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
don't which schools will be the most
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
affected by it okay it will be the
 
00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.030 align:start position:0%
affected by it okay it will be the
poorer

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
poorer
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
schools right because they will be the
 
00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
ones that have the most students that
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
are performing so you're so you can say
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
that there's going to you know you can
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
maybe have like sixth grade teacher
 
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
remedial teachers com down you know I
 
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the point was made previously
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh but it seems to be
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
inevitable and you know maybe I'm wrong
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
on this but it seems to be inevitable
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
that this will put the greatest
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
burden on the poorest schools who are at
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
least able to support that level of
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
remediation and
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
secondly there's no support to bring in
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
you know if if if my argument's right
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
that you would need more Personnel to do
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
this there's no money to do that so this
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
is like an unfunded mandate that will
 
00:50:05.359 --> 00:50:06.510 align:start position:0%
is like an unfunded mandate that will
fall

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionately on the schools least
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
able to handle it that's what I would
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
say yeah representative
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
leus I'm wondering what your suggestion
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
is then are we to just leave these kids
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
a year behind and then two years behind
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
and then 3 years behind because we don't
 
00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.190 align:start position:0%
and then 3 years behind because we don't
want

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
to stress the
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
school um my suggestion would be uh that
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
what's I mean I would totally agree with
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
the speaker before me I'm sorry I don't
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
should know your name Lor Lori ball uh
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
Lori says you that that I think that the
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
most important thing is to get early
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
intervention I think her argument that
 
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
when you leave leave kids in the system
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
for a long time that's uh you know they
 
00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:01.799 align:start position:0%
become like what one of my graduate
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
students called lifers they become
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
lifers they you never get out so I think
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
what's needed is support
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
in you know maybe in in in conjunction
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
with some requirements for remediation
 
00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
support for particularly for lower
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
income schools so they have tutorial
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
help so that they can provide this kind
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
of assistance
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
that's what I mean so I think to to to
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
just mandate this stuff without any kind
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
of support for poorer schools is it just
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
kind of it's It's kind of magical
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
thinking you know just it's kind of like
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
just do this and we're not going to give
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
you any money to do it and it's going to
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
work and and I so I would say that there
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be some effort to do that and I
 
00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
think too that that part of the problem
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
as I see it in lower performing schools
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
is you have such turnover of teachers
 
00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
and so there's it's it's like tied into
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
bigger Financial issues in terms of
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
teacher salary and and churn the kind of
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
churn that goes on in some lower income
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
schools so I think there's a lot of
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
things that I would do but I think one
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
thing I would do is to get to get
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
tutorial help one of the things that a
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
school like oyer river which is you know
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
we have tremendous advantages we've just
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
hired 15
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
tutors coming out of the pandemic and
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's really helped
 
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
us mediate learning law
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I think something like that needs to
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
go on in in other other school districts
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
but I think they don't have the
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
resources to do that uh I I don't think
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
you can wish this thing to happen
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
without any kind of you know support
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
Beyond just requirement for these these
 
00:52:42.119 --> 00:52:43.589 align:start position:0%
Beyond just requirement for these these
these

00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
deadlines ref Terry I go ahead and then
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
I want to ask ask a question after you
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
um back in in
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
1970 mhm I was a fourth grade teacher
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
after I came back from Vietnam okay and
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
when I went and got my credentials to be
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
an elementary teacher was above and
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
beyond the bachelor's degree I presently
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
possessed but when I was trained I was
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
trained to be able to provide this type
 
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
of Remediation in my classroom we
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
usually had three or four different
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
reading levels which we were teaching
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
with in that classroom M with today the
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
average pupil teacher ratio in an
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
elementary school is down around 14 to1
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
12 to 14
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
to1 why is not
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
the Elementry classroom teacher able to
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
address these issues with the skills
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
level I still think think I I think that
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
they they should be and I think that I
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
think certainly the teachers I've seen
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
are able to address a lot of those but I
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
think that there are situations where
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
they where they're going to need other
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
help or they're going to have to spend
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
more of their time with with the
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
teaching at the the the tier one so I'm
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
not saying that can't happen but I think
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
that to do what this bill requires would
 
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
take more Personnel in my view I don't
 
00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:23.480 align:start position:0%
think you could just say te this this
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
teachers in situ they in can handle can
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
handle can handle this without that
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
extra support so I I'm not disagreeing
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
with you I'm just saying that that would
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
not be adequate to to handle this this
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirement I'll just follow it up I
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
then somebody's got to answer the
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
question for me excuse me that with a
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
ratio of 12:1
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
14:1 now we're saying we need to have a
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
ratio of 1 to six or one to
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
S and I don't know how we can sustain
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
that in public
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
education and with a remedial reading
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
teacher maybe on board in that school
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's support can be provided to the
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher for the classroom
 
00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:09.799 align:start position:0%
teacher to impart to the child am I off
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
course or no I don't no no you're not of
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
course but I'm just my view is that to
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
do what this bill requires would take
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
more than that that's what I would say
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
Okay represent Terry Professor thank you
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
so uh um I I'd like to reference and
 
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that you have spoken to the
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
first sentence under that follows
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
numeral one the bill mandates approaches
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
that are not themselves evidence-based
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
and I've heard you speak to that thank
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
you so uh if we could go in the way back
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
machine back to Circuit 2014 at that
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
time did you believe that the uh then
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
new method of teaching reading was
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and if so would you the
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
new re the new method I'm sorry
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
2014 I'm new to the committee what what
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
do we call this Excuse me fontis pel yes
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
2014 langage are different different
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so if I may um did did in 2014 or
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
Circle 2014 did you believe that there
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
was sufficient evidencebased uh material
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
to go forward with that methodology at
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
and if so would you just speak to that
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
briefly how so I don't know that I had
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
an opinion on F and panel at that time
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
that's so
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that it's always been the
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
case that some that students need to
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
know sound symol correspondence I don't
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
think that that's ever been something I
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
didn't that's something I didn't believe
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
in I believe that foundas and pelis
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's been portrayed here is not
 
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
exactly accurate I think there is word
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
work and phonics in fonus and panel and
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
I just before I came here I looked at
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
the new book they have on literacy and
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
it has a section on on phonic so I I
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
don't think that's been exactly
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
represented correctly uh
 
00:57:14.549 --> 00:57:14.559 align:start position:0%
I I I I think that I've always believed
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
that it's important for kids to become
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
Avid readers and for them
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
to have so things like classroom
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
libraries and self-chosen reading has
 
00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839 align:start position:0%
always been important so I've always
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
believed that so I would say I've always
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
believed that phonics and sound symbol
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
correspondence is important one of the
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
terrific things that's happened with
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
writing is often you get kids writing
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
earlier sounding Out words and that's a
 
00:57:46.109 --> 00:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
terrific way to practice phonics so
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
early writing like four or five years
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
old and I've always thought that that
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
was really important so I've always
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
phonics was important important I think
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
that how much and who needs how much
 
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
there's some there needs to be some
 
00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:03.039 align:start position:0%
differentiation there because you'll
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
have kids coming in like Scout and To
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
Kill a Mocking Bird who can you know
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
read right away and then you'll have
 
00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:11.799 align:start position:0%
kids who need more intensive work so
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
that I think sometimes my concern with
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
some of these programs is you're going
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
to have like a one- siiz fits-all and
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to have kids going through
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
whole class instruction that don't need
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
it and there's an opportunity cost there
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
because then they're not doing other
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
things they should be doing so so I've
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
always believed it I've always believed
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
that it should be
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
differentiated um and I I think the
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
found and pel did have enough did they
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
have did have phonics and did have uh
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
strategies for for reading words and
 
00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
sounding Out words was it enough I think
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
maybe there there should have been more
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
but but I think I've always felt that it
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
it should be it should be a part yeah so
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
going back to 214 I'd say
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
agreed but you're not sure on the the
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
question of of evidence-based
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
because is your question did I think
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
phonic not phonics did I think f
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
pel space at the time it was
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
introduced because that's the concern
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
you're raising here with respect to this
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
bill and effectively a return to phonic
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
as a primary means or way of of teaching
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh reading so I'm just wondering what
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
did you have a view as to whether there
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
was adequate evidence base in 2014 or
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
did you not remember or you weren't I
 
00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
don't think I had an opinion I mean I
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved in in that so I was I
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion on that great
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thanks are there further
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:39.109 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
represent

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much uh Mr chair and
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Professor new newerk
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
for uh being with us this morning
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to uh refer to um to the um
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
the methodology that was U that's listed
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh in the fiscal note that I think you
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
referenced a little bit earlier just
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if it comes as a surprise to
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
you that the um Department New Hampshire
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh apparently
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
does not have any information on current
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
practices in place regarding um phonemic
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
awareness phonics fluency vocabulary
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
comprehension writing grammar and
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
mechanics speaking listening mathematic
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
reasoning that they don't have any
 
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
reasoning that they don't have any
information

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
from any of the what do we
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
go60 plus um school districts across the
 
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
state he's reading exactly what's in the
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
the note I'm just wondering if that
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
comes as a surprise to you that that
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education doesn't
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
have information on that it it does and
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
when I read that statement I
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
thought they're say I I I'd have to go
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
back and reread the statement my memory
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
of it is they they could not make an
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
assessment of the effect of this bill
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
because because they didn't have this
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
information so I'm so I'm doubly I'm
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
confused that they wouldn't have this
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
information but I think is that a reason
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
why you can't assess the impact of this
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
bill you know I'm not sure that I don't
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
follow the logic because it seems to me
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
that one of the
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
obligations and I've not been in your
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
seat you know so but it would seem to be
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
one of your jobs is to say what's the
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
what's the effect of this bill how is it
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
going to affect schools and how's it
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to affect schools
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
financially and my point that I've been
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
trying to make here
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
is you need to determine that I think
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
before you go forward with this bill so
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
maybe that's just repeating what I've
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
said before thank you thank you further
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:05.549 align:start position:0%

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh good morning members of the House

you for allowing me to speak today um
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
for those anyone who does not know Becky
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
Wilson I am the director of governmental
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
relations for the New Hampshire school

boards

01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
boards
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
Association uh we certainly appreciate
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
the focus on read instruction um and
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
provid providing uh increased
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students to be
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
proficient in Reading uh the focus of
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and several other bills that
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
have come before this committee uh we
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
realize it's a sensitive topic and a
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
place where there needs to be Focus
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
given uh across the state and I think
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
that has happened pretty significantly
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
over the past two sessions and continues
 
01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
to be um however as many of you know uh
 
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
NH hsba is opposed to legislation that
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
would uh take away the ability of local
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
districts to make decisions on
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
curriculum uh and instruct at the local
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
level that matches their particular
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
Community needs uh we do have some
 
01:03:02.430 --> 01:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
concerns with some of the terms in this
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
bill not being defined I think that's
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
been brought up before so I won't uh
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
harp on that in terms of measurable uh
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
evidence-based some of those other
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
things um I do want to just address as
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
well um a little bit about response to
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
intervention and some of the comments
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
that have been made about those
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
processes um RTI is meant to address
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
concerns when students are not meeting
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
whatever benchmarks and to vet out the
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
difference um excuse me between um
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
getting over a little cold so I
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
apologize uh meant to V out the
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
difference between students who need
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
help and students who may have a
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
substantial um need that could require
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
specially designed instruction under
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
special education eligibility um it's
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
not a question where sometimes
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of what's being taught in
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
school there may be a con concept or
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
skill where a student struggles with
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
that particular concept or skill it does
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean that they are going
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
to meet eligibility for special
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
education uh response to intervention is
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
meant to provide exactly that a targeted
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
intervention to try to discern whether
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
or not the child just needs help with a
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
particular skill and once they learn it
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
as somebody I think mentioned previously
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
um that skill has been remediated that
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
deficit and the student can move forward
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
or whether the student really is
 
01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
struggling with uh a concern that may
 
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
lead to special ed eligibility that is
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
what response to intervention is meant
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
to to address um to the sponsors point
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to be um this
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
longstanding system where students are
 
01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
in that for an undetermined amount of
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
time uh however until 2004 uh idea
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
required that when a student was
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
referred to special education under
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
potentially needing uh special ed Force
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
specific learning
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
disability um districts were required to
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
use what was called the discrepancy
 
01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:02.200 align:start position:0%
model which was you had to look at a
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
students overall ability score and the
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
scores that they achieved on specific
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
skills and there had to be between 20
 
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
and 25 Point discrepancy that was the
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
law you had to use that if you didn't
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
meet that discrepancy the child was not
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
eligible under uh specific learning
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
disability when idea was renewed or
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
redone in 200 for they allowed districts
 
01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:27.799 align:start position:0%
to make a decision you could use the
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
discrepancy model uh many districts felt
 
01:05:32.589 --> 01:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
that that was not really representative
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
of their students needs if you had a
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
particularly good score on a particular
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
day that you did the testing your kid
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
might not qualify and that might not be
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
representative of what their actual
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
needs were um so you could continue to
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
use the discrepancy model or you could
 
01:05:50.109 --> 01:05:50.119 align:start position:0%
use an RTI model meaning you had
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
concerns about a student you would make
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
a referral um you would put put the
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
student into some sort of intervention
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
progress and process and see if they
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
made enough growth to make you feel like
 
01:06:03.069 --> 01:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
they needed targeted intervention and
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
the team could decide at that point um
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
the reason the students doing better is
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
because of the intervention and they
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
need more of it so maybe they would be
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for special ed or it was enough
 
01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
to close the gap that I think's been
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times um so many
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
districts use a combination of both of
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
those methods but you have to have one
 
01:06:23.309 --> 01:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
of the two you can't just come up with
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
whatever process you want um I also
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to address the concern that I
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
think was brought up previously about
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
why numbers um of students with a
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability might
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
increase at age 10 um the reason for
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
that could be that there is a category
 
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
under special ed called developmental
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
disability which is uh when students are
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
very young and you're doing overall
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
ability testing on a six-year-old it's
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
very hard sometimes to feel as though
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
that really represents their full
 
01:06:54.029 --> 01:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
potential um so you're allowed to
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
identify students to get special
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
education under what's called
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
developmental disability you have to say
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
what you suspect their overall
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
disability maybe down the road and then
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
by the time they turn 10 you have to
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
decide what other category they are
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
going to fall under or whether or not
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
they no longer are eligible so it's very
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
common that you might have some students
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
up through age nine that would be under
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
developmental disability that category
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
is not available after age 9 so then you
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
have to decide so they might fall under
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability and that
 
01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
might be why you're seeing that increase
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
um lastly I want to speak to the
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate piece of this bill um
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
just for people's overall knowledge um
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
some of these phonics based trainings
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
and specific trainings in terms of like
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
Orton Gillingham for example that's a
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
onetoone teaching situation to become a
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
level one Orton Gillingham uh teacher it
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
costs about $10,500 per person and takes
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
60 hours you have to keep that up over
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
time there's requirements that happen so
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to train a number of
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
teachers in your District to be Orton
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
Gillingham certified you could do that
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
but it's going to cost a pretty
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money never mind
 
01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:08.079 align:start position:0%
you have to get someone to cover that
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
person's duties while the person is at
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
60 hours of training um the letters
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
training which is also a phonics based
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
approach which is being provided to some
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
people again it's $700 just for the
 
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
books and it's about 60 60 hours to
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
become level one certified it takes a
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time um same with
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Wilson program which is another
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
phonics based program so um there's
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
certainly lots of pieces of this bill we
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
understand the concern that students
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
need help you can't also supersede the
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
special ed process if someone makes a
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
referral the team has to address that
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
referral within 15 calendar days that's
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's it you have to dispose of the
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
referral but I want to be uh mindful of
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that just because a student is
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
referred does not necessarily mean that
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
the team is going to decide the student
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
needs further evaluation just because a
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
student is referred does not necessarily
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
mean the student is going to be found
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for special education so you
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
can respond to referrals but to the
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
previous um person's point in terms of
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
referral meetings require a certain
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
group of people to get together that is
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
required by federal and state law to
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
discuss the referral those people if you
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
have multiple referrals are not going to
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
be able to do the other parts of their
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
um jobs without getting other people to
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
cover them so you're going to need more
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
school psychologists more reading
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
Specialists more special ed teachers Etc
 
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions thank
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent petel thank
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned how much it
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
cost to train somebody in Orton
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
Gillingham and I know that with the
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
Esser funds and I'm not exactly sure
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
with all of the details about what
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to use it for but um you
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
know there's a certain portion of it in
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
this phase three or third stage of the
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
Esser funds that they're allowed to use
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
it for learning loss and my District's
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
awarded $1.2 million they could train
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
120 teachers in Orton Gillingham would
 
01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
that be an appropriate use of the Esser
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
funds uh thank you for the
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
question Orton Gillingham is a very
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
specific teaching methodology which as
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard has been around for a very
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
long time it is meant to be provided to
 
01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
students who are substantially below
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
where they ought to be in a onetoone
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
situation for an extended period of
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
time to I think the previous speaker
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
point I'm not sure that pandemic
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
learning loss should qualify students as
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
being seen as having a disability per se
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
so whether or not you want to use those
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of strategies to try to mitigate
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
learning loss that would be a district
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
level decision but I'm not sure
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
providing every student a onetoone
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
reading period for 60 minutes a day
 
01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
um and the is what a district would
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
choose to do with that those funds um
 
01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
you also have to be very cautious that
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
whatever you provide through grant money
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
you can sustain once the grant is gone
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
um you have a maintenance of effort
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's required as part of your Grant
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
application you can't just give people
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
things as part of the Grant and then
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
when the grant Runs Out take them away
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to sustain those and
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how a district would do
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
that further questions represent
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman good morning
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
good morning um I'd like to refer just
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh to Professor nk's uh one of his
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
comments and and get your opinion he
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
indicated that he believes that this
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
will make a significant financial and
 
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
Staffing impact on schools less
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh funded uh and staffed at this point
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
that maybe uh taxing or almost he didn't
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
use the word uh unreliable but uh I'm
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
using that word that couldn't accomplish
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
that um would you agree with that
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
statement or you think this what's your
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
thinking on that uh thank you for the
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
question um over the past several
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
sessions there's been quite a few um
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
bills that have come out focused on
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
reading instruction um obligations of
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
districts in terms of providing reading
 
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
intervention reading assessment reading
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
instruction um because of the way that
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
legislation is written there has been a
 
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
very big impact on local districts in
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
terms of making sure that they have the
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
staff to provide the Assessments in the
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
timeline that's been identified um make
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
sure they have the staff that are
 
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
trained to understand the assessments
 
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
that they're given making sure they have
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
staff to be able to provide
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
interventions at the level that that
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
legislation has required making sure
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
that they can go to local public charter
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
schools uh because the local Lea is
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for that piece of it so
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
there are aspects of that that if you
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
were to kind of overlay that with this
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
particular proposed bill I think you
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
would see a very similar impact in that
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
you're requiring a certain type of
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
intervention on a certain timeline a
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
certain type of evaluation in terms of
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
special ed on an additional timeline on
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
top of the idea and on top of your state
 
01:13:03.070 --> 01:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines that would force districts to
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
need to try to um staff in a way that
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to meet that legislation
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
and I think for some of your um less um
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
your more resource poor districts they
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
already have a difficult time Staffing
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
some of these things that are already
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
required so I think if you're looking at
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to provide additional special ed
 
01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
staff in a district that already is
 
01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
resource poor trying to find more people
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
to come in to do that um would be
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
difficult and I also think that when you
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
look at the full system in those
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
districts um they may have a fairly
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
robust um RTI process the problem is
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
that you're changing the criteria that
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
the district has already sort of dis put
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
into practice on how they're working
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
people through those systems so the
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
impact on that would be I think again
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
undeterminable but if you wanted to
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
provide you know more specific phonics
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
based instruction you're looking at at
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
least you know 10 to 15,000 per teacher
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
um just to get the people you already
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
have sort of schooled up in that
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
particular way thank you
 
01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
yes um thank based on your Association
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
your uh your school Association and and
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
around the state are there
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh sufficient number a reading
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
specialists at this point in time let's
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
say this enacted and to come in in Fall
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
for September are there enough reading
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
Specialists even available in the state
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
of Hampshire uh thank you for the
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
question I don't know the number of
 
01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
people at the department that are
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
certified under that particular license
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the department could get you
 
01:14:43.470 --> 01:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
that information the question is how
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
districts are using their reading
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
Specialists whether they're using them
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
more as a consultant model that I think
 
01:14:50.189 --> 01:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
someone had mentioned earlier where the
 
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
reading specialist is training teachers
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
to provide the interventions or whether
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
the reading Specialists are required to
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
provide them themselves if that makes
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
sense thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
leus I'm trying to figure out why you
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
said Orton Gillingham needs to be
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
oneon-one and only for special needs and
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's not Orton Gillingham but I
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
I remember in the early 60s when I was
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
in elementary school they they came out
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
with this whole new phonics whatever and
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the teachers were given the materials
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
and they followed the materials and the
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
instructions and the materials and we
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
did it as a whole class the teacher
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
taught it as a whole class it wasn't it
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
was not 101 it was not any of that and
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
it was not go spend huge amounts of
 
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
money per teacher to them be able to
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
take one-on-one and all of that it was
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
just here's the materials the materials
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
explained how to use it boom they used
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
it boom we all learned
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
phonics explain to me why where you're
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
coming up with these I don't know
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
oneon-one and special ad and all this
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
other stuff when we're talking when it
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't even say Bon Gillingham is
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
talking about all of these things which
 
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
is what I learned and it was new thank
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
you for the question the question is
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
where did I come up with the criteria
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
for and
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
Gillingham well or or why it's going to
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
cost or why it's going to cost all of
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
this money for each teacher and why you
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
expect them to be one-on-one and only
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
special ed in all of that other kind of
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
stuff doesn't it make sense that if it's
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
a method that works that we would use it
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
with all students instead of one on one
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
and only to specialed students and does
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
it have to be Orton Gillingham if that
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
takes requires individual instruction or
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
why we wouldn't just use the whole
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
basic like we did when I was a kid and
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
the teachers were given the materials
 
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
and like um they were talking about when
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
they came out with the
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
new stuff the teachers were giving
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
materials and they followed it right and
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's what happened to my teacher when
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
they came out here's the
 
01:17:08.189 --> 01:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
materials do it thank thank you for the
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
questions I think I would do my best to
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
try to answer all of those thank
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
you um in terms of or Gillingham and how
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
oron Gillingham specifically is provided
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
that is the way that that program is
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
designed and developed and so if you
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
want to become certified in that or your
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
District wants you to become certified
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is what you are agreeing to do I
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
can't speak to why Orton Gillingham
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
decided that that was the way to go but
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
that is that is the way that it works um
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
there are many many districts in the
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who use a Wilson
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
beas whole group approach called
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
foundations I'm sure you've heard of it
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
if any of you still have contact with
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
kids in schools that are in the
 
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
elementary young grades you probably
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
have heard of Foundations there's a
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
whole again a curriculum that goes with
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
that again your teachers need to be
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
trained in that you need to buy the
 
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum for every single teacher they
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
all need their own manuals they need
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
their own supplies and there's
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
differentiation within that program that
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
you must provide as a general Leed
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
teacher you have a lot of people that
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
you are bringing into the system uh who
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
are on alternative pathway programs to
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
become certified who have never gone to
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
teacher prep so to address somebody's
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
comment earlier about how come people
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
just don't know what to do if you've
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
never been part of a teacher prep
 
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
program you're not coming in with any
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of brain-based learning
 
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
how people learn how to read you're
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
learning all of that as you go while
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're also learning how to implement
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
the foundations program for example um
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of training that goes
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
with implementing foundations with
 
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
Fidelity it's very easy to read things
 
01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
out of a manual but that's not
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily what um general education
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
people will tell you is implementing a
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
program with Fidelity uh and then if you
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't Implement these programs with
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
Fidelity what happens is you get a
 
01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
skewed number of students who are
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
referred for intervention because it's
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
based off of uh inconsistent
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
implementation of a program across a
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
school so you will end up with some
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
classrooms who are getting multitudes of
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
referrals to special ed or intervention
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
and some that aren't getting any because
 
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
people are implementing what they think
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
the program is supposed to be but not
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily understanding why they need
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
to implement it in a particular way so
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
these programs all come with their own
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
criteria um there is money attached to
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
all of that whether or not the district
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
has to come up with those funds to train
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
their entire staff but foundations for
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
example is a wh School approach you
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
train all of your teachers and everybody
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
that is involved with it from K to three
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
typically um how a district funds that
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
and manages that is um up to the
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
district because they're determining
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
that that is the instruction or
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum that they want to use it's
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
not a mandate that's being handed down
 
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any other
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you you um
 
01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:06.149 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you you um
Jerry

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
FW welcome thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee I'll keep
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
my remarks very brief Mr chair as I
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
recognize the facial angst of you
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
running behind schedule for your
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
hearings so you got it I'm hearing you
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
um but uh first of all we appreciate
 
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
very much the sponsor's concern and
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
share with the sponsor the importance of
 
01:20:31.149 --> 01:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
literacy for all kids at early ages so
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
that they don't become behavioral
 
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
problems they don't become dropouts and
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
they don't become issues later on um and
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
potentially criminals down the road uh
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
so reading instruction and literacy is
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly important um I'm not going to
 
01:20:47.629 --> 01:20:47.639 align:start position:0%
be labor points that were made by
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
Professor newerk or I can't be nearly as
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
eloquent as Miss Wilson in her in her
 
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
testimony in pointing out the the
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
various factors I would like to raise a
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
couple of concerns and I believe some of
 
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
them most of them have been brought up
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
um but I won't be label them um I
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
believe representative balbon uh uh
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
brought up the fact that this only
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
applies to school districts and why not
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
charter schools and and why not and I
 
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
think it does have to be specific that
 
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:17.560 align:start position:0%
it applies to Charter Schools uh and uh
 
01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
also um you know other entities that
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
receive public funds perhaps to add
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
grade levels of
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
remediation um require Staffing and they
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
require resources and I think about our
 
01:21:33.629 --> 01:21:33.639 align:start position:0%
large cities and what they would spend
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh and in uh trying to support and where
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
does that instruction take place some of
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
our buildings are cramped for space and
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
where do you where do you pull the small
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
groups of kids uh out to offer that
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
required tier 2 instruction or uh you
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
know the potential increase in
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
developing educ
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
individual education plans IEPs through
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
the special education process when we're
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
already experiencing shortages of staff
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
for par Educators service providers
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
teachers um there are there's a human
 
01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
component here of providing that level
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
of instruction and I believe another
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative raised the question about
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know the role of parents in helping
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
to prepare children for reading and
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
supporting you know the Bedtime reading
 
01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
stuff and and those things um
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
level two in special education cost
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
money classroom teachers working with
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
parents are best suited to make the best
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
educational choices for their kids in
 
01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
their local level and that happens and
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here to tell you unless you spent
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
and and I even though I'm not sitting in
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
one of those chairs I listen to every
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
hearing that this committee has and and
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
the perspective that you all bring to
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
the table every one of us in this room
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
everyone here everyone there everyone in
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
this building has a museum of school in
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
their mind right what their school
 
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
experience was I can remember sixth
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
grade like it was yesterday because it
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
scared the hell out of me but that that
 
01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.790 align:start position:0%
scared the hell out of me but that that
said

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
um we all think we know what schools
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
look like these days and I'm here to
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
tell you we
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't we don't don't spend an hour in a
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
classroom don't spend a day in your
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
local school go spend a week when the
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
committee can ever stop meeting go spend
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
a week in your local school in the
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
second third or fourth grade classroom
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
and see what happens observe the
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
instruction see the attention that kids
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
get see the support that they get with
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
par Educators if they can find par
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
Educators see the support that they get
 
01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
through special education systems
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
currently in place we don't need another
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
law we don't need another prescription
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is well-intended and absolutely
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
Wilson Reading systems are great Orton
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
Gillingham is great Becky talked about
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
the costs involved with those the time
 
01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
element of professional development the
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
training required and it's not oneand
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
done it may be a million dollars you
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
might be able to spend that Esra money
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
for for the initial training but what
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
happens when theer money goes away and
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to go away soon so then what
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
happens to maintain that training to
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
maintain that opportunity for all kids
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
coming down the pike not just the kids
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
in school right now not just trying to
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
recover that and so I think that's
 
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
important we nhsaa sees this as a forced
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
local taxation by the state as a
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent I'm thinking about
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
developing my budget for the you know
 
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday next Tuesday many school
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
districts adopt their budgets for next
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
year okay this law takes into effect 60
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
days after passage that can't happen
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
Okay districts have their budgets in
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
place even two years out it's going to
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
this law would impact local taxation
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
because it requires staff it requires
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
intensive training and support for kids
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
not just one or two hours a day all the
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
days of the year in in these classrooms
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
and uh so with that I'll stop because I
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
told you I would thank you very much
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Damon
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:27.400 align:start position:0%
here and taking my question independent
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
of the clearly very concerning costs of
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
this proposed
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
legislation do you see any need for what
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
it proposes to do as contrasted with
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
what is currently happening in schools
 
01:25:42.629 --> 01:25:42.639 align:start position:0%
to teach these competencies thank you
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
for the question representative Damon
 
01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
what I do see is the
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
inequity of How It's applied and all due
 
01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
respect to Professor
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
um new Kirk and and the Oyster River
 
01:25:58.750 --> 01:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
experience is probably looking pretty
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
different today than the experience in
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
Newport where they can't hire power
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
professionals they can't find the
 
01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:09.639 align:start position:0%
people and so the concern is how do the
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
kids in Newport get the same experience
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
as the kids in
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
deram or Amherst or Bedford and oh by
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
the way they do spelling tests because I
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
have grandchildren in the Bedford
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
schools and they're studying for their
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
spelling tests so spelling happens
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
spelling tests
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
happen thank you further
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much and with
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to close this
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%

194f uh as being the um the the the term
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
used for for every third-party
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
organization that provides things from
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
services such as um instructional
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
Services private schooling uh but also
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
materials that may be books or
 
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum and things like that they're
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
all Educational Service Providers and uh
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
the bill before us this morning um only
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
applies to education service providers
 
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
that are um that are part of the um the
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program and um
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
and in the um in the statute that exists
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
quick I
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
can under um 194f colon 6
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
um the uh the the present statute um uh
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
puts uh puts a few requirements on um
 
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
Education Service Providers and one of
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
those requirements is to uh comply with
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
all state and federal anti
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination laws so that's um in the
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
statute right now
 
01:30:01.030 --> 01:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
194 F colon 6 Rome
 
01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.510 align:start position:0%
194 F colon 6 Rome
two

01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
um paragraph
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
C so what uh what the bill before us
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
today does is it
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
modifies uh that statute 194 F 6 by
 
01:30:23.229 --> 01:30:23.239 align:start position:0%
inserting another paragraph Roman three
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
and it's real short it's only a few
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
sentences um couple sentences long and
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and what what what Roman 3
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
adds is essentially two two things one
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
that Education Service Providers have to
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement an
 
01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:46.510 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement an
anti-discrimination

01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
policy that's outlined under RSA 193
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
colon 3 9 so that's a state
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law it's a law that
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
the education service providers already
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
have to comply with but now they have to
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
put together a policy on how they will
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh Implement develop and Implement an
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination their own
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policy consistent
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
with that and the second thing that uh
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
that the bill does in this new Roman 3
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
is um require the State Board of
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.310 align:start position:0%
is um require the State Board of
Education

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
Education
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
to conduct an annual review of the
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
Education Service uh providers for
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
continued compliance with their policy
 
01:31:34.669 --> 01:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
and um and so uh I don't think it's a
 
01:31:34.679 --> 01:31:35.590 align:start position:0%
and um and so uh I don't think it's a
heavy

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
heavy
 
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.149 align:start position:0%
heavy
ask

01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
the it's not a heavy ask there there's I
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
mean this is about
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination and there's a lot of
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
people when it comes to
 
01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
people when it comes to
anti-discrimination

01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
that talk the talk but what this bill
 
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
does is it walks the
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
walk and that's the intent of um House
 
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 1654 thank you very much are there
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
and B going to come up with a
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
policy that's going to say I'm not going
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
to discriminate if all I'm doing is
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
selling whatever book a parent asks for
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
and see how is the Department of
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
Education going to determine whether or
 
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
not I followed some policy about un
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination when all I'm doing
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
is selling whatever book a parent ask
 
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
for sure thank you very much for the
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
question so um so this is a this is a
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
great example of how businesses
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
businesses that we do business with
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
every day whether they're Gibson's
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
bookstore right here on um Main Street
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
and Conquer I think the oldest
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
continuing operating business in uh in
 
01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
the city of conquered and um um and it
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
would require if if Gibson's bookstore
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
was to be approved as an education
 
01:33:15.430 --> 01:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
service provider that they would have to
 
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:18.280 align:start position:0%
have a non-discrimination policy that
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
would guide the development and
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of a coordinated plan so
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
now I'm actually reading from
 
01:33:27.990 --> 01:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
19339 to prevent assess the presence of
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
intervene in and respond to incidents of
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination on the basis of age sex
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
gender identity sexual orientation race
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
color marital status familial status
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me disability religion national
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
origin or any other classes protected
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
under 354a um and so so as far as a
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
bookstore is concerned that could have
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
to do with hiring practices it could
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
have to do with discriminating um
 
01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
against having
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
discriminating um actions against uh
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
against potential customers uh or
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
potential or contractors they do
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
business with um uh bookstores do uh do
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
business with uh with Distributors so um
 
01:34:12.669 --> 01:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
so making sure that there's that there's
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
no discrimination on that so just as it
 
01:34:18.189 --> 01:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
would apply to just about any business
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh whether it's a bookstore a restaurant
 
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
cordelli um thank you uh thank you
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno um I'm just
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
wondering about um religious
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
organizations um let's say um a Catholic
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
school did not want to hire a a a
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
teacher who was uh possibly an atheist
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
and um uh had uh uh opinions contrary to
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
um the teachings um of that school um
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
would they uh possibly be in violation
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
of your proposed um statute so so what
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
they would be in what what what they
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
would be measured against is the policy
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they develop and and if their
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
policy uh says that that we're not going
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
to hire somebody that believes in
 
01:35:17.070 --> 01:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
something totally different than than
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
what we believe um that that may may
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
may be something that uh that that
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
allows that to work out um uh for them
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
so it's that's that's why this
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
isn't I mean keep in mind again all of
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
the education service providers have to
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
comply with state and federal
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws what this bill
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
is doing is saying they have to develop
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
their own policy based on based on um uh
 
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
19339 with the paragraph I just read in
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
terms of how they Implement um that
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
policy so obviously you know I'm not an
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
expert in this area uh but but if
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
there's a policy that passes Muster that
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
allows them to not hire uh certain
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
people who don't have the um the the
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
background or understanding or skills or
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
something like that then clearly you
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
know people don't get hired for um for
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
those types of reasons so so uh possibly
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's a way that that could be
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
address yes so then um in terms of their
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
following um state law right and
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws as as you
 
01:36:37.149 --> 01:36:37.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out um that would also apply to
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh RSA 354 a colon 18 which is an
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
exemption from the statutes for
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
religious organizations so that uh
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
statute would apply to a a religious uh
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
School of any type correct yeah I mean
 
01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
if if if that's the um uh any other
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
classes protected under
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
354a so so I'm reading from 19339 so
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
this all this all follows so if you say
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's what follows What flows from that
 
01:37:13.629 --> 01:37:13.639 align:start position:0%
um uh ref I have one question here I'll
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
go back to your reference to Gibson yeah
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure you're very familiar with
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
through your family correct um um if in
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
fact gives and then contracts with
 
01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:25.669 align:start position:0%
fact gives and then contracts with
another

01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
organization to provide books or
 
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
materials and then the the EFA program
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever it may be is you buying
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
those books from Gibson's but the
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
corporation or the business that's
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
providing it to Gibsons do they also
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
have to have a such a policy that's
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
being recommended right now yeah I don't
 
01:37:51.629 --> 01:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for very much for the question
 
01:37:55.149 --> 01:37:55.159 align:start position:0%
I don't really read this as as as
 
01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
implying or requiring a a second level
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
indirection on um on that this this is
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to education service
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
providers who have been um I don't know
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
what the term is in 194 approved by the
 
01:38:14.589 --> 01:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
um by the uh the the scholarship
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
organization so so if um if if if if a
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
um if an education Service Pro provider
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
subsequently contracts out I I I'm I'm
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
not reading this as having you know
 
01:38:32.189 --> 01:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
infinite NE Terry so uh thank you so you
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
you have um indicated uh that uh and
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
you're referencing uh in existing law so
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
why would there need in your view to be
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
a policy what are the implications for
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
not having a policy so the implications
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
for not having a policy are um are are
 
01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.750 align:start position:0%
for not having a policy are um are are
probably

01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
at least twofold one of them is
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
education service providers differ in a
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
lot of different ways some of them are
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
providing instructional Services some of
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
them are excuse me providing materials
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
such as books and um and they're they're
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
the way they Implement
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination um policies
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with state and federal law
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
may be dependent upon what type of
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
business they they are so so that's the
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing the second thing
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
um is that it actually gives the State
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Education the ability to
 
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
annually review that business against
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
their compliance with with their policy
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh on that and um and you know and and
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not suggesting that every
 
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
education service provider would have an
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
identical policy uh internal policy with
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
regards to anti-discrimination because
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
like I said I think it would be
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the type of business they
 
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
are and the business practices that they
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
um um you know that they that they have
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
so um so you know this is all about a
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
let's if we're going to talk the talk
 
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
let's walk the walk and this puts puts
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
some teeth behind uh anti-discrimination
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the um the education
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
program further questions represent dry
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
question how does this mesh with 194 F7
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
the independence of Education service
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
providers where there nothing in this
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
chapter is deemed to limit the
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
independence autonomy of the providers
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
um they're given maximum freedom to
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
provide for this nothing ISS construed
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
to expand the regulatory authority of
 
01:40:35.589 --> 01:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
the state and it goes on and on I mean
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
they're given Pro protection here from
 
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
having to make any alterations to their
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
Creeds or practices in order to accept
 
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.189 align:start position:0%
Creeds or practices in order to accept
EFA

01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
funds yeah and and uh thank you and and
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
and I think they would just have to um
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
um you know call that out in their
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policy and obviously
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot to
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
194f um 194f is also referencing um uh
 
01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:03.750 align:start position:0%
194f um 194f is also referencing um uh
sorry

01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
19339 one of the state's
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policies and if they
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
want to lean on a um a policy that is by
 
01:41:14.669 --> 01:41:14.679 align:start position:0%
definition discriminatory in terms of
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
hiring or doing business or Contracting
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
or something like that then um then then
 
01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
if they want to uh you know lean on what
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
you just uh read then then they're then
 
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
they've got statutory backing on it but
 
01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh but again this goes to talk the talk
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
walk the walk and and if they're going
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
to if they're going to have
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination uh in their hiring
 
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
practices or other business practices
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
that say so and um and they can lean on
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
the statute you just
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
called represent leus you have a
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead to when you say their
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
policy you're talking about the policy
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the Scholastic organization the the
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
education service provider because
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's this like I said this bill
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
requires two things for the education
 
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
service provider to develop their own
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
policy and for the State Board of
 
01:42:12.669 --> 01:42:12.679 align:start position:0%
Education to annually review for
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
compliance against
 
01:42:17.709 --> 01:42:17.719 align:start position:0%
that repr
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
leus do we have the ability in New
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as legislators to pass laws
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
that affect people in other
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
states if if we're approving them to do
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
business I mean we I I believe the um U
 
01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
there are New Hampshire Contracting laws
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
Contracting requirements that are
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
attached to every contract that the
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
executive Council passes and whether
 
01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
those contractors are based in New
 
01:42:46.589 --> 01:42:46.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or based outside of New
 
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if contractors don't
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
comply with with those Provisions then
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
they don't do business with New
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah so yes so follow up yes
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
so we would be able to ask that of
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
Amazon and Amazon would have to come up
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
with a policy and then our doe would be
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
able to track Amazon and see whether or
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
not they followed their policy um that's
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
a great question I I would
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
be so I don't know specific in the in in
 
01:43:20.189 --> 01:43:20.199 align:start position:0%
the in the example of Amazon but given
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
how how large that company is and and
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
how much reach they have globally I'd be
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
surprised if Amazon does not have an
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policy of their own
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we'd be able to make sure they
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
follow follow up yes please would we be
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
able to make sure would the doe have the
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that Amazon
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
followed their policy yeah I'm I'm I'm
 
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'd have an ability to do
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock yes thank you chairman Le thank
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm a pretty simple guy I'm
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
finding this very confusing I uh in
 
01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.390 align:start position:0%
finding this very confusing I uh in
respect

01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
respect
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
that everyone in the business field for
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
the most part now who does hiring and
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
does other
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
operations knows what the Discrimination
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
piece is and they follow it so all
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
you're asking am I right here all you're
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
asking them to do is put it in writing
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
and give it to us so we can make sure
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
you're following it is that what is that
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
what this is yeah that's what I thought
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I got a question here um
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
why did you in your language here put
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
the task for the annual review on the
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education rather than on
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
the scholarship
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
organization um that's a good question
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
um you know so so I think it it just
 
01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
provides a level of of oversight and
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
accountability that is connected to um
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh directly back to the
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
state okay represent McDonald thank you
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair representative do you know the
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
number or could you provide an estimate
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
of the current service providers that
 
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
may not be in
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
compliance I I don't have any specific
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
information of any service providers
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
that that are not in compliance of the
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
current statute um I don't know how many
 
01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
of those do not have their own internal
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
not anti-discrimination policies and may
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
I have a follow-up
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
question if 60 days after this bill's
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
passage it is determined that a service
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
provider is not in compliance what
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
happens to the students that have
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
already purchased say textbooks from
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
that service complier would they have to
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
refund the EFA program through class
 
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
wallet digital
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
wallet a texbook they already paid for
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
and is that expense on the family is it
 
01:45:37.950 --> 01:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
retroactive how does that work yeah so I
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I don't know how that uh
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
would work I think that would bear out
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
in in the rulemaking authority that has
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
afforded the State Board of Education
 
01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:47.629 align:start position:0%
afforded the State Board of Education
under

01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
541a uh which is referenced in 194 4f um
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
and um and you know I would I would
 
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
certainly expect that um that any of the
 
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
education service providers uh that uh
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
that are already approved by the in the
 
01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
EFA program that don't have their own
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
internal uh anti-discrimination policy
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the books would um would be able to
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
um to craft something relatively quickly
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and and get something done um uh
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
consistent with this chapter yeah
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
last question from represent cordelli uh
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you back on schedule well no we
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
have we're not there yet we trying to
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
get there um I just wanted to follow up
 
01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
on uh chairman lad's uh previous
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
question and um the State Board of
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
Education um uh ensuring comp uh
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
continues of compliance and you said
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the policies that they have put in
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
place but it also says with all state
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
and federal
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law so I'm just
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
wondering how the State Board is going
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they are in compliance
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
with state and federal
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
law yeah well we're already requiring
 
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
that of the education service providers
 
01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:04.950 align:start position:0%
that of the education service providers
in

01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
194f so so again this is this is this is
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
the teeth um uh on that so so um again
 
01:47:15.830 --> 01:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
not an expert in this area but I think
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
that would have to bear out under
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
rulemaking okay so I'm not going to

01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and committee
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
Monday

01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
apologize my name is David Trumble I'm
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
from the town of wear and I support this
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
bill for a couple reasons first of all
 
01:48:41.229 --> 01:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
schools teach by their example RSA 19339
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that civil rights apply
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
to our public schools and they must be
 
01:48:46.350 --> 01:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
free of discrimination against all the
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
listed classes there's no place in
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
education for discrimin ation or
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
Prejudice the New Hampshire Constitution
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
says the purpose of education is the
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
preservation of a free government and
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court defined it as
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
furthering the political and social
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
viability of the state schools don't
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
just teach lessons they teach by their
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
example and by prohibiting
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination Public Schools provide
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
equality education to every child and
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
further teach all of our children the
 
01:49:14.669 --> 01:49:14.679 align:start position:0%
important lesson that everybody is
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
worthy of respect and should be treated
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
equally in the eyes of the law second if
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
we fund
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
schools or education service providers
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
that permit discrimination this works
 
01:49:27.790 --> 01:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
against the Constitutional purpose of
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination not only will we be
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
denying that appropriate education to
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
all children but we would indeed be
 
01:49:36.510 --> 01:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
teaching students that discrimination
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
and Prejudice are acceptable the US
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court had the case of Norwood
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
versus Harrison back in 1973 on a 90
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
decision they held that a state cannot
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
provide Aid to a private school that
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
discriminates based on race and the the
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
ing was that discriminatory treatment
 
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
exerts a pervasive influence on the
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
entire educational process it doesn't
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
just affect that child it affects
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
everybody in fact it affects our whole
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
community so if schools have policies
 
01:50:05.310 --> 01:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
that uphold prejudice and discrimination
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
then the state is within its legal
 
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
rights to refuse to fund
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
them a few specific areas one lgbtq
 
01:50:15.550 --> 01:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
children most Americans 70% incomparable
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
percentages of most major religious
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
denominations except for white
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
evangelicals support same-sex marriage
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
and do not find homosexuality to
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
conflict with their religion there are
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
many religious schools that find
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination against lgbtq people to
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
be toxic and hurtful and believe there's
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
no place for such attitudes and beliefs
 
01:50:36.189 --> 01:50:36.199 align:start position:0%
their educational policies would comply
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
with this statute and would comply with
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
the state civil rights laws I think that
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
all schools who receive EFA funds should
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
have policies where all lgbtq students
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
are welcome and no student should be
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
treated as sinful due to their sexual
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
Orient ation specialed students number
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
two they make up 20% of the children in
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
our public schools and they are all
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
welcome there and they all have a legal
 
01:50:58.830 --> 01:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
right to a free and appropriate
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
education they are vastly
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
underrepresented in EFA schools at
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
between 6 and 7% I believe that an EFA
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
school should include the word
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
disability in their statement on
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination guarantee that
 
01:51:12.069 --> 01:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
students will not lose their legal
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
rights under the idea accept all
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities provide
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate education to all those
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
students and adopt discipline policies
 
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
that would keep students in school not
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
on a fast track to expulsion and lastly
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
English language Learners I believe that
 
01:51:28.709 --> 01:51:28.719 align:start position:0%
EFA schools should adopt the same
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
policies as public schools to provide
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
Educational Services to all students
 
01:51:34.270 --> 01:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
including those who need education in
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
additional English I'll just finish up
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
with a quote from professors Kevin
 
01:51:40.310 --> 01:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
wellner from the University of Colorado
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
School of Education and law and Preston
 
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:44.440 align:start position:0%

they wrote in private school vouchers
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
legal challenges and civil rights
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
protections whether publicly governed or
 
01:51:52.350 --> 01:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
privately operated schools must still
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
prepare students for life for jobs and
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
for participation in our democracy they
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
must serve all students not just the
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
easiest or least expensive to educate
 
01:52:03.069 --> 01:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
they must abide by core ideas of
 
01:52:04.990 --> 01:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
fairness protecting children against
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
bigotry and discrimination and certainly
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
not actively subjugate subjugating
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
children to these harms and they must
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
meet basic standards of accountability
 
01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:14.800 align:start position:0%

time to give you the breakdown I was
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
citing from an NBC news report from 2020
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%

this I'm sorry there was a long article
 
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
I only cut and pasted that paragraph to
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
keep it short because my understanding
 
01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:41.800 align:start position:0%
is that Muslims do not agree with um
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
homosexual marriage I am not an expert
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%

01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
look at section 354a the
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statute I'm kind of
 
01:54:34.510 --> 01:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
inspired by the preamble to it and one
 
01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
part of it says the general court hereby
 
01:54:38.669 --> 01:54:38.679 align:start position:0%
finds and declares that practices of
 
01:54:40.069 --> 01:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination against any of its
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
inhabitants because of and list all the
 
01:54:44.430 --> 01:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
different categories um are a matter of
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
State concern that such discrimination
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
not only threatens the rights and proper
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
privileges of its inhab abant but
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
menaces the institutions and Foundation
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
of a free Democratic State and threatens
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
the peace order health safety and
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
inhabitants um the EFA program has is in
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
a sense you could describe it as a kind
 
01:55:11.470 --> 01:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
of parallel system of Education offered
 
01:55:14.189 --> 01:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
to uh a large percentage of our
 
01:55:16.669 --> 01:55:16.679 align:start position:0%
population and funded at least in part
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
by The Who are funded at least in part
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
by the public to go to whatever system
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
or opportunities they choose and it's uh
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
as I've followed it it seems it's based
 
01:55:29.629 --> 01:55:29.639 align:start position:0%
on the premise that money raised via
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
taxation for uh for Education should
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
quote follow the child and it's my
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
belief that if the public money is going
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
to follow the child then so should the
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
rights that they would have if they had
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
stayed in public school and I that's
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
just um I don't think I'm going to go
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
much further than that I just feel
 
01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to ensure that
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
students wherever they're trying to get
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
an education are not having the door
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
closed on them because of their
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
disability their lgbtq status whatever
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
the status might be we should be uh we
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
should be strengthening those
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
protections because public money is
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
involved I don't think any taxpayer
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
should have to pay taxes that go to a
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
school that their own child would not be
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
allowed in because of their
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
race color religion um disability lgbtq
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
status Etc it seems to me once we've
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
injected public money into these private
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
places then public rights should also
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
follow thank you thank you very much
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
Mary are there questions from the
 
01:56:39.870 --> 01:56:39.880 align:start position:0%

that

01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
no he's not no
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.589 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:57:08.589 --> 01:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
okay good morning
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
morning I'm Kate Baker deur is this on
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
if it's red yeah okay good executive
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
director of children's scholarship fund
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to testify but um I do
 
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:25.480 align:start position:0%
need to share just some concerns that I
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
have um there are no schools in New
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are discriminating
 
01:57:34.189 --> 01:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
against children of those
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
groups that um the last person who
 
01:57:37.639 --> 01:57:39.750 align:start position:0%
groups that um the last person who
testified

01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
discussed existing laws already prevent
 
01:57:46.109 --> 01:57:46.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination and so the concerns that
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
I have are um the discussion that you're
 
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
having around this policy that schools
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
will need to put into
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
place the children that are coming to us
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
at Children's scholarship fund in these
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
types of situations that are
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
experiencing discrimination are coming
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
to us looking for an alternative the
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
schools that they are coming to us from
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
already have this policy in place does
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
39 policy exists in the public schools
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
or charter schools that they're coming
 
01:58:31.629 --> 01:58:31.639 align:start position:0%
to us from and so saying that putting
 
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
this constraint on the place that
 
01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:36.040 align:start position:0%
they're going
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
to how does that solve a challenge right
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
so families are coming to us because
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
they might experience discrimination
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
racism and they're looking for a safe
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
alternative and so to say that this
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
solves something having them create a
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
policy that already exists in the places
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing that that bullying
 
01:59:03.310 --> 01:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
or discrimination or racism just seems
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
backwards to me in addition um the State
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed is not the Human Rights
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
Commission if someone experiences those
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
types of scenarios they would go to the
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission to find reconcil
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
iation and help to say that the State
 
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed should be able to even
 
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
assess a a discrimination or
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policy I I don't
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
think the State Board of Ed even has
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
that skill set to be able to look at say
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
Amazon's policy and decide if it meets
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
the criteria to me that would be
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
something that belongs in the Human
 
01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.030 align:start position:0%
something that belongs in the Human
Rights

01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
Commission and then again I just want to
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
reiterate that the existing organization
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
and entities that exist in New Hampshire
 
01:59:55.229 --> 01:59:55.239 align:start position:0%
all fall into our
 
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policies that exist
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
and laws that exist and it's the
 
02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
opposite entities are not discriminating
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
against children in different groups
 
02:00:10.510 --> 02:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
they're helping them to be able to solve
 
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
some of those existing problems so
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
thanks for hearing me out thank you very
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
much are there questions representative
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you take
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
my question you're
 
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
welcome so you've clearly stated two or
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
three times that the existing Education
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
Service Providers although you didn't
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
use that term but I understand that's
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
what you
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
mean are not discriminating so could you
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
please explain why is it a policy for
 
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
why is it a problem for them to have a
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
policy that says they don't discriminate
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes they they do already have policies
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
that that say they don't discriminate
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
under state law and so I I just don't
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
think this makes sense to put the State
 
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
Board of Ed in a position where they're
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring those non-discrimination
 
02:00:58.709 --> 02:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
policies when they don't have the skill
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
set to do that it's the Human Rights
 
02:01:04.589 --> 02:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
Commission who would enforce any type of
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination and and again I'm
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
finding that kids are coming to us
 
02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
because they're experiencing this in
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
places that already have this policy and
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.149 align:start position:0%
 
logic

02:01:21.149 --> 02:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
yes are you saying that the education
 
02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
service providers all already have this
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
policy so businesses and and schools
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
usually have posted on their website a
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policy that already
 
02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination policy that already
exists

02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
yes person Hall thank you Mr chair and
 
02:01:44.069 --> 02:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
problem are you as a followup so are you
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying that education service providers
 
02:01:54.189 --> 02:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
all Education Service Providers uh have
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
policies have policies I I'm guessing
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
I'm gu I'm guessing that it's not
 
02:02:01.390 --> 02:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
something that we monitor but if you
 
02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
think about any entity business school
 
02:02:06.109 --> 02:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
otherwise like I know I can think of
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
schools where you go to their website
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
and right at the bottom it says
 
02:02:12.189 --> 02:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination BL policy blah blah
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
blah I mean that's a normal procedure
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
for anyone in my opinion the the
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
challenge with this bill is again
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
putting the onus on the State Board of
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
Ed to try and have any like I I I
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
understand the sponsor was calling that
 
02:02:31.629 --> 02:02:31.639 align:start position:0%
teeth but I think that's the opposite of
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
teeth right to me the people who are
 
02:02:39.229 --> 02:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
civil rights experts would be the people
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
who if a family was experiencing this
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
type of situation right they would go to
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights experts at the Human
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission
 
02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
to get some sort of reconciliation to me
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
you're putting like a speed bump in
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
their way like what if a family
 
02:02:58.270 --> 02:02:58.280 align:start position:0%
experienced discrimination and then went
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Ed when they
 
02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
should be going to the Human Rights
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
Commission I mean to me you're almost
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
creating a mechanism where you would
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
confuse someone who was actually
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
experiencing a situation where they were
 
02:03:10.719 --> 02:03:11.750 align:start position:0%
experiencing a situation where they were
being

02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised right the families that
 
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
come to us are looking for a situation
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
that's not the situation where they're
 
02:03:21.390 --> 02:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
being dis franchise currently and this
 
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
already exists there and so if you have
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
an existing public school or a charter
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
school this policy already exists there
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
and and it's not having it may not be
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
having the effect that that the sponsor
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
wants it to because families are still
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
coming to us and saying I'm experiencing
 
02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
my child is experiencing discrimination
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
or racism or bullying because I'm an
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
lgbtq kid and I need to go somewhere
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
else and so then to take it the idea and
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
then put it over here when it's already
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
seems to be and again it's my
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
circumstantial information right I
 
02:03:57.790 --> 02:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
didn't go collect data about how many
 
02:03:59.830 --> 02:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
reports there are of this I just know
 
02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
that for example lgbtq kids are the most
 
02:04:05.549 --> 02:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
bullied kids in any school and to say
 
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
that this is working there I think it
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
would be an overstatement when those are
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
the families that are coming to us to do
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
something else why would we do the same
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
thing over there when they already have
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission that could
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
enforce any
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
any discrimination that they experienced
 
02:04:22.159 --> 02:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
any discrimination that they experienced
and

02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you no I'm I'd rather move on
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
we have some other questions we're also
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
getting into the time of the next one so
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
if there's other people haven't asked
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions to this point on this uh yes
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have them speak
 
02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:38.310 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have them speak
representative

02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
pel I just wanted to
 
02:04:44.669 --> 02:04:44.679 align:start position:0%
clarify um briefly so if I'm correct
 
02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing you say is that
 
02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
children are leaving in you children and
 
02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
parents and families who um take
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of the education Freedom
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
accounts are leaving possibly leaving an
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
institution where they do not feel
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
included so that they can go to an
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity where they will
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
feel included is that what you were
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
trying to say does that sum it up well
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's different than just inclusion
 
02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
I mean sometimes the families or
 
02:05:17.950 --> 02:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
children are experiencing even violence
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
to come to us and it is a very small
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
group right I can't make broad
 
02:05:25.589 --> 02:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
statements because again there are
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
families who remember take the education
 
02:05:29.310 --> 02:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
Freedom account money and pay a public
 
02:05:31.229 --> 02:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
school for classes and courses so I'm
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
not I can't make a broad statement I'm
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
just telling you that a small group of
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
families come to us because their child
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
is experiencing what they say is racism
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
or bullying or you know specifically
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
being targeted because they're an lgbtq
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
kid and they're coming to us to go do
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
something else else and they're coming
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
from a place where this policy that
 
02:05:55.669 --> 02:05:55.679 align:start position:0%
we're discussing and this bill already
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
exists to go somewhere else so I'm just
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
to me that's not a it's not a solution
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
to that challenge when that's why
 
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
families a small group of families are
 
02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
coming to us to go to somewhere else
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
that that's that was my thank are there
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
any other qu ref Woodcock thank you hi
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative um I just want I
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
understand I understand the whole School
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
versus school I got all that yeah and
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
there is a there already is a protocol
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
for the Human Rights Commission I
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
understand that yeah but if I understand
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
from one of the having looked at some of
 
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
the print outs from the uh organization
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
yeah there are multiple providers yeah
 
02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
that they deal with the organization for
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
a host of things for youngsters fine all
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
it forgetting the kids in the school
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
park we know they already have
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policies right as
 
02:06:45.270 --> 02:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
the most of the receiving schools they
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
have them as well so yes but there are
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
other provided that this bill will
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
attack provide their requirement to to
 
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
take what they have for an in essence
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
working policy and put it in writing and
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
send it to the State Board of Education
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's not suggesting the State Board of
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
Education is is going to be the in Lee
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
of the the human rights board not at all
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
this is just saying if you if you do
 
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
these things just show us the policy
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's all it is so I don't want to
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
confuse the the big issue of LBG or
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
antidiscrimination in schools and school
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
there's a host of other providers that
 
02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
that should require to keep disc that's
 
02:07:21.709 --> 02:07:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's all yeah to your point I think it
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be challenging to implement
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
because there are sometimes a provider
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't know they're a provider so
 
02:07:31.149 --> 02:07:31.159 align:start position:0%
if a family is choosing for example
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
right now we're trying to on board all
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
the community colleges in New Hampshire
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
so that the families can pay them
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
directly but a family could get
 
02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed if they paid the community
 
02:07:42.750 --> 02:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
college and then gave us the receipt and
 
02:07:45.629 --> 02:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
so there might be entities that don't
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily know that a family has used
 
02:07:51.390 --> 02:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
their um service or bought something
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
there and so I think that's kind of A
 
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
Wrinkle in this where there'd be a group
 
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
of providers that don't necessarily I
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
remember in the oversight committee um
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
there's a representative on the
 
02:08:05.350 --> 02:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
oversight committee who has a school and
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
a family had been reimbursed for tuition
 
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
they had paid at that school and the uh
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative didn't didn't know that
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
it was it was news to them and so that
 
02:08:17.069 --> 02:08:17.079 align:start position:0%
part of that this I think is
 
02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
unenforceable but the there thank you Mr
 
02:08:22.109 --> 02:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah uh are there any more
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
questions of thank you thank you very
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
Christina wow um bar Christina thank you
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
chairman lad bar Christina executive
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
director New Hampshire school boards
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
Association we are not taking a position
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill I want want that to be
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
clear um the anti-discrimination
 
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
provisions relative to vouchers I
 
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
addressed three or four years ago with

thank you well maybe you could look up
 
02:09:57.790 --> 02:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
uh 354 a Col 18 which is the religious

02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
sir okay nothing in this chapter ex
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
nothing contained in this chapter shall
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
be construed to Bar any religious or
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
denominational institutional
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
organization or any organizational

organization operated for charitable
 
02:10:18.669 --> 02:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
purposes yeah that nhba doesn't dispute
 
02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
that certain organizations private
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
entities are allowed to discriminate or
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
have their own admissions policies
 
02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's been my
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
testimony consistently throughout
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
throughout all all the voucher bills I'm
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
not saying a Catholic school has to
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
accept transgender kids or a Muslim
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
school has to accept non-muslims that is
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
not the point of nhba testimony again
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking a position on this bill I
 
02:10:41.470 --> 02:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
that private schools expecting accepting
 
02:10:47.709 --> 02:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
EFA money are allowed to discriminate
 
02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:50.599 align:start position:0%
and if whether they choose to or not
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's not my prerogative
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
but they're allowed to do so and they're
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
their their anti-discrimination policies
 
02:10:59.030 --> 02:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
on their websites say this here's
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
another one the school reserves the
 
02:11:03.629 --> 02:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
right within its sole discretion to
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
refuse admission of an applicant to disc
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
or of an applicant to disc discontinue
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment of a student probably without
 
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
due process mind you so you know we we
 
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't need to go down that rabbit hole
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
either but I just want to clarify that
 
02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:20.599 align:start position:0%
private schools accepting EFA money are
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to discriminate and nhba is not
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
taking making a value statement about
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
that but L there be any confusion as to
 
02:11:30.270 --> 02:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
what some of the previous testimony I
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that for the
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much other
 
02:11:37.069 --> 02:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
questions represent thank you Mr chair
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question in
 
02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
reading of the bill I as I read it maybe
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
you can tell me if you read it the same
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
way um it's just saying that they have
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
to publish and have a policy correct
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank for the question representative I
 
02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the bill in front of me I
 
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
trust you're reading it
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
accurately thank you representative pet
 
02:11:59.709 --> 02:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
now thank you I'm just confused you um
 
02:12:01.549 --> 02:12:01.559 align:start position:0%
referred to the voucher program and as
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
far as I know we have an education
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program can you point to
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the RSA where the voucher program exists
 
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you it's RSA
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
194f I believe EFA and Esa they're all
 
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
types of vouchers sort of me like if I
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
were at White Park and I said look at
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
that malard and somebody said that's a
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
mailer that's a duck I I I think it's a
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
distinguishment without a difference
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative further questions thank
 
02:12:41.149 --> 02:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
Horgan yes I'm back so I'm represent Tim
 
02:12:45.069 --> 02:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
I continue to be represent Timothy
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
horens just like it was yesterday from
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
straford County District 10
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham I think I mean I this
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
is one of those bills when you look at
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised it was necessary because I
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
just figured that would already be the
 
02:13:00.270 --> 02:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
case that you wouldn't want um you
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to be providing taxpayer
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
Monies to an organization that uh that
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
discriminates although we did have the
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday which uh dealt with
 
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
certain issues in the Human Rights
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
Commission so so I think this is very
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
common sense Bill if they're accepting
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
these taxpayer dollars they should be um
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
not just will but eager to um eager to U
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
go along with the
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws and also um
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't directly affect the
 
02:13:32.910 --> 02:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization um the uh but
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh but they they they also should be
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
bound by the
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination Discrimination laws
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
and so and of course we do also have the
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
situation where we have a entitlement
 
02:13:47.149 --> 02:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
program which is growing pretty rapidly
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
and there's lots of Bill to expand it
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
and we've turned it over to we turned
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
over the administration of this program
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
to a fairly small organization that's
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
not clear who they're accountable to and
 
02:14:00.669 --> 02:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
you know so compare that for example to
 
02:14:02.990 --> 02:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
the cash benefits like tanif or Aid to
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
the uh disabled or food stamps which
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
have a very well first of all they have
 
02:14:10.109 --> 02:14:10.119 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policies in place
 
02:14:11.709 --> 02:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
for that program but they have a very
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
like robust uh governance there's like a
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
whole floor of people over on Pleasant
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
Street who Minister those programs and
 
02:14:18.870 --> 02:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
also the Department of a there's a
 
02:14:20.510 --> 02:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
federal program of private contractors
 
02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
so we've turned over a program that's
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
certainly as complicated as food stamps
 
02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
or cash benefits and um we're we' turned
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
it over to just this um small
 
02:14:33.030 --> 02:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
organization whose headquarters in Mr
 
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
chairman talking about t for food stamps
 
02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
here we're we're talking about an EFA
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
program yes talking about there there's
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
ISS please stay on topic okay efas so
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
I'll there are numerous issues with the
 
02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:46.599 align:start position:0%
governance and program and one of them
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
is the anti-discrimination policies so
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
there should be one and it should be
 
02:14:52.750 --> 02:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed on a regular basis and we
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
should not be giving taxpayer money to
 
02:14:56.189 --> 02:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
organizations that discriminate and that
 
02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
seems pretty simple to me and um
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you are is there any questions
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
I see thank you very much and this
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
closes our our hearing for
 
02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
1654 I think he he
 
02:15:11.239 --> 02:15:13.470 align:start position:0%
1654 I think he he

02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:16:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the next bill which
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%

what would normally this time the year
 
02:16:52.349 --> 02:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
be a snow covered Granite State so um um
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um the opportunity this
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
morning to introduce House Bill uh
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
1650 um I'm glad we were able to spend
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
so much time on the proceeding bill
 
02:17:05.469 --> 02:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
because a lot of this material will will
 
02:17:08.750 --> 02:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
is directly relevant to 1650 and while
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
the uh proceeding bill was was directed
 
02:17:13.629 --> 02:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to the education Freedom
 
02:17:16.349 --> 02:17:16.359 align:start position:0%
account program and education service
 
02:17:20.669 --> 02:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
providers 6 1950 is directed to what is
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as the learn
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere program and um and um um
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
alternative programs that are approved
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
by the state board for um uh for
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
granting credit leading to graduation uh
 
02:17:38.990 --> 02:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
under uh what's commonly known as the
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program so the um uh
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
the the learn everywhere program was
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually established in um
 
02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
in 193
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
5 and U and under current law uh there's
 
02:18:07.389 --> 02:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
not much to uh to that statute other
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
than the state board can approve
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
alternative programs leading to um uh
 
02:18:17.309 --> 02:18:17.319 align:start position:0%
credit leading to graduation um the um
 
02:18:19.150 --> 02:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh the only provision that's uh that's
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
currently under there is that the State
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Education can adopt rules to
 
02:18:26.429 --> 02:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
manage that program under
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
541a so what uh what 1650 does is uh
 
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
goes a little bit beyond that and um and
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
actually you know establishes um more of
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
a hard deck for uh for these alternative
 
02:18:41.790 --> 02:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
programs uh which are subject to
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
approval by the state board and unlike
 
02:18:48.349 --> 02:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
the previous bill which um which which
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
which where where the statute
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
194f uh does reference compliance with
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh with state and federal
 
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws there's no such
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirement in statute for programs
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
approved um to be um to be run as part
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
of the what's known as the learn
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
everywhere program so um so this
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
um this bill High School 1650 does three
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
things uh it requires that uh that
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
thirdparty programs uh to be approved by
 
02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education under this
 
02:19:31.230 --> 02:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
program um comply with um with Federal
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
and um and and state non-is
 
02:19:37.709 --> 02:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination programs and have
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
policies in place that are required of
 
02:19:41.950 --> 02:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
school districts and charter schools
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
which would have to accept credits for
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
leading to graduation from these
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
programs uh um have policies in
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
place set forth under RSA
 
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
19339 so that's the that's the chapter
 
02:19:56.910 --> 02:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
in the law that we were just talking
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
about that um that uh uh requires the
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
the development of policy that guides
 
02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
the development and implementation of a
 
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
coordinated PR plan to prevent assess
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
the presence of intervene in and respond
 
02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:13.030 align:start position:0%
the presence of intervene in and respond
to

02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
incidences of discrimination on the
 
02:20:19.389 --> 02:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
basis of all the protected classes that
 
02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
um uh that we talked about before so so
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh so it it requires that keep in mind
 
02:20:27.950 --> 02:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
the learn everywhere what it's known as
 
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
the learn everywhere program um is to is
 
02:20:35.950 --> 02:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
to it is basically something that works
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
hand and glove with local um uh public
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
schools to earn credit leading to
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
graduation so this is a public school
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
program so that's the first thing it
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
does it is it it establishes that hard
 
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
deck for an anti-discrimination policy
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
the second thing it does and this is on
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
sort of lines um uh 8 through 20 of the
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
bill so one two and three um uh the
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
second thing it does is um is require
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
requires that an ad hoc committee
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
evaluate the application for programs
 
02:21:13.389 --> 02:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
that are applying to be part of the
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere uh program uh much of
 
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
this in fact
 
02:21:20.590 --> 02:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
it may be that all of this is currently
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
in rules uh that govern the program
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
except for the sh part and why is that
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
important because if it doesn't actually
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
require an ad hoc committee to evaluate
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
the application then in some cases it
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen and in some cases it
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
didn't happen uh for example when when a
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
program was uh was being um uh put forth
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
for for approval uh during the middle of
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
last summer when um when when a lot of
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
lot of um you know teaching faculty are
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
on vacation or maybe working you know in
 
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
in summer camps or in summer jobs uh in
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country or in New
 
02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so so um so it requires that
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee can be convened to
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
evaluate the the application like I said
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
I took the um these these Provisions
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
from existing rules and then the third
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
thing it does and again this is very
 
02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
similar to what we were just talking
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
about um requires an annual review to be
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
conducted by the State Board of
 
02:22:25.790 --> 02:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
Education um of these um uh educational
 
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
programs approved under the learn
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere program for continued
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with their with state federal
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws including the
 
02:22:37.389 --> 02:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
policy that uh that's that they're
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
required to have under um under this um
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh provision so uh with that I I hope
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
people see a lot of common elements
 
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
except you know with with the uh with
 
02:22:51.389 --> 02:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account program
 
02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
there was the talk the talk and we put
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
in the walk the walk this does both of
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
these things because under current
 
02:23:00.349 --> 02:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions Uh current statutory
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions it doesn't require um uh
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
compliance with anti-discrimination laws
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
so this is let's talk the talk and let's
 
02:23:11.469 --> 02:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
walk the walk thank you thank you very
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
much are there questions from the
 
02:23:14.830 --> 02:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative cordelli thank
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
you um just wondering if
 
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
um especially um B1 that you added here
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
would that uh apply to uh locally
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
approved ELO
 
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
programs uh no th this um this applies
 
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
specifically under programs that are um
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
that are approved by the State Board of
 
02:23:38.349 --> 02:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
Education I believe a locally uh
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
approved program would certainly have to
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
comply with um with all the policies
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
that the public school district has in
 
02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
place which include policies on under um
 
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
under RSA 19339 so that provision would
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
already be in place yes thank you but
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
that that requirement for the ELO
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
programs approved locally is nowhere in
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
statute that they would comply with
 
02:24:04.110 --> 02:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
19339 well they would have to because
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're essentially
 
02:24:08.429 --> 02:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
being being part of the public school
 
02:24:10.349 --> 02:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
offering the public school has to be
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
19339 further questions from the
 
02:24:19.389 --> 02:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
leus I'm wondering how this would apply
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
a I don't know an air for an
 
02:24:35.469 --> 02:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
air um training for kids to be able to
 
02:24:35.479 --> 02:24:36.510 align:start position:0%
air um training for kids to be able to
go

02:24:36.510 --> 02:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
go
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
and get a p you know Learn to Fly
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
because disabilities are included in
 
02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
that and I can certainly think of a
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
number of disabilities that would
 
02:24:50.670 --> 02:24:50.680 align:start position:0%
disqualify a kid from learning how to
 
02:24:53.790 --> 02:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
fly and would that mean that then no
 
02:24:55.670 --> 02:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
kids would get to do that because they
 
02:24:58.469 --> 02:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't accept all kids yeah so thank
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
you for the uh thank you for the
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:25:04.990 --> 02:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the case of a flight school they
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
would have to have an
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination policy that um that
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be compliant with
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
19339 and certainly many disabilities uh
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh would be accommodations could be made
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
so that uh so that uh somebody with a
 
02:25:22.830 --> 02:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
disability could uh could take flight
 
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
lessons and receive a a pilot's license
 
02:25:29.070 --> 02:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the case that um that that they would
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
not be able to eventually receive a
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
pilot pilot's license perhaps um they
 
02:25:35.710 --> 02:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
could go through some of the other parts
 
02:25:37.469 --> 02:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
of Flight Training which incl include
 
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
Ground School and uh and that may be uh
 
02:25:42.990 --> 02:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
be a possibility but uh but there's
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
certainly um so many other uh of the
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
protected class classes that uh that we
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
would not want the um uh a flight school
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's approved under the the
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
what's known as the learn everywhere
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
program to be discriminating against um
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh lgbtq Plus or on any of those other
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
um uh protected classes further
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
questions you have another question yes
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'm but I'm
 
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
wondering yes there are those others but
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
this law doesn't say accept it says all
 
02:26:20.510 --> 02:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
of them and so if a flight school can't
 
02:26:24.030 --> 02:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
accommodate all of them does that mean
 
02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:25.830 align:start position:0%
accommodate all of them does that mean
nobody

02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
02:26:30.269 --> 02:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
can uh no I I I disagree with that uh
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
with that premise I believe that that
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
the flight school could certainly uh
 
02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
adopt uh adapt a program to uh to meet
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
just about um you know all the needs of
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
uh of all the needs of people that are
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
interested in um in experiencing that
 
02:26:46.479 --> 02:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
interested in um in experiencing that
program

02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:26:49.950 --> 02:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
dry thank you and thank you for taking
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
my question I I'm going to ask the
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
question we asked yesterday in a similar
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill um are there examples right now of
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
this being violated I don't have any
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
examples thank you further questions
 
02:27:07.389 --> 02:27:07.399 align:start position:0%

name is Frank edbl I'm the commissioner

of education for the Department of
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
Education uh members of the education
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your service to
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
the state and to your constituents
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the Department of
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
Education we appreciate your efforts to
 
02:27:42.349 --> 02:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
advance opportunities for all children
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so that
 
02:27:47.389 --> 02:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
each one might realize a bright future
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
I generally try to avoid hearings such
 
02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
as this but appreciate the invitation to
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
come and speak with
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
you my experience is that when I do show
 
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
up it can be a bit of a distraction to
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
your good work and that you are
 
02:28:01.630 --> 02:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise doing and I would not want
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
today reading the language of hb650 I
 
02:28:12.349 --> 02:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
could not help um but assume that this
 
02:28:15.110 --> 02:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh that some people may refer to
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
this bill as one of those a solution in
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
search of a problem a less generous
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
reading of the statutory language might
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
be that it is a deliberate attempt to
 
02:28:27.269 --> 02:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
limit student opportunity but not just
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
any student rather the language limits
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity of otherwise
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
disadvantage students here in the state
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
of New
 
02:28:37.269 --> 02:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I can't imagine that
 
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
anyone would want this as an outcome of
 
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
the proposed
 
02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
law the statute seems to be targeted and
 
02:28:48.030 --> 02:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
I the um Prime sponsor has indicated at
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
a uh Department program called learn
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
everywhere for those of you unfamiliar
 
02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
with the program um you know the program
 
02:28:57.070 --> 02:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
is affectionately called that because
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
whether we understand that or not
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
children are learning everywhere and
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
they are learning all the time uh
 
02:29:04.590 --> 02:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
learning is not limited to the hours of
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
7:30 to 2:30 in a specific location that
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
is simply contrary to human nature for
 
02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
your reference this particular program
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
has been recognized lauded and written
 
02:29:19.150 --> 02:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
about Al by the right likes of Rick Hess
 
02:29:21.389 --> 02:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
among others and for those of you who
 
02:29:23.309 --> 02:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
are unfamiliar with Rick Hess he is a
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized voice for public
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
education learn everywhere program
 
02:29:31.389 --> 02:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
allows students to earn credit for
 
02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
learning that takes place everywhere and
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
I sometimes tell the story of one of my
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
own sons who attended Berkeley in his
 
02:29:41.590 --> 02:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
first semester at Berkeley uh the
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
college allowed him to test out of 18
 
02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
college credits recognizing that he had
 
02:29:49.469 --> 02:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
already mastered the requisite content
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we too Aspire for
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
this type of a competency based Learning
 
02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
System that acknowledges student
 
02:29:59.830 --> 02:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
learning section one of the statutory
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
language is targeted in RSA
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
19339 which is an
 
02:30:08.830 --> 02:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination prevention policy
 
02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
that is required by our Public
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
Schools if the sponsor of this bill is
 
02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with discriminator
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices of learn
 
02:30:19.389 --> 02:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
everywhere program we at the department
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
have had no such
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
complaints the sponsor should understand
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
that any learn everywhere program is of
 
02:30:28.349 --> 02:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
course and I've heard a lot of
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
misstatements about this up here in both
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
the last hearing as well um is subject
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire and federal
 
02:30:38.110 --> 02:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statutes including
 
02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statutes including
RSA

02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:30:43.070 --> 02:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
354a any out of school program would
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
also of course be subject to
 
02:30:47.230 --> 02:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination provision
 
02:30:49.469 --> 02:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
of their state as well as the federal
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
statutes so all of these businesses all
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
of these entities are are bound by law
 
02:30:59.110 --> 02:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
in order to be have and follow the
 
02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:00.750 align:start position:0%
in order to be have and follow the
anti-discrimination

02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
practices it was interesting because the
 
02:31:05.710 --> 02:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor indicated that other outside of
 
02:31:08.670 --> 02:31:08.680 align:start position:0%
school learning programs would have this
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
policy in place when in fact that's not
 
02:31:10.479 --> 02:31:11.309 align:start position:0%
policy in place when in fact that's not
the

02:31:11.309 --> 02:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:13.950 --> 02:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
case um if the objective is a sponsor is
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
to provide added protections to students
 
02:31:18.349 --> 02:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
and we do want to protect our students
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
who are engaged in learning
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities outside of the Traditional
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
School environment and thus subjecting
 
02:31:24.910 --> 02:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
them to
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
19339 it would be necessary to cast a
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
far wider net than this bill
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
contemplates students in New Hampshire
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
participate in learning opportunities

provide learning opportunities for

students what the sponsor might not
 
02:32:55.870 --> 02:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
understand is that these are an
 
02:32:57.510 --> 02:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
essential part of the education
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
landscape here in New Hampshire I might
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
add that many states are actually
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
jealous of the extent of the many
 
02:33:05.870 --> 02:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities that New Hampshire
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
students are afforded it would not be
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
realistic to assume that FedEx or
 
02:33:13.630 --> 02:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock as an example are
 
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
going to subject themselves to RSA 193
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
339 and adapt the policy that we require
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
for our Public Schools they simply won't
 
02:33:25.389 --> 02:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
do it and they are already subject to
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
RSA 354a anti-discrimination Provisions
 
02:33:30.349 --> 02:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
right these are not entities that are
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
exempt from that so the effect of this
 
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
bill will simply be to limit unique
 
02:33:39.389 --> 02:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
Hands-On educational opportunities for
 
02:33:41.710 --> 02:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
our students and in particular our
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students the research is
 
02:33:46.110 --> 02:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
clear when underperforming students
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
students are afforded opportunities to
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
learn outside of the traditional
 
02:33:52.190 --> 02:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
classroom and the classroom
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
instructional environment they do better
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they are more engaged other
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
provisions of the statute create policy
 
02:34:00.750 --> 02:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
much of which is already embedded in the
 
02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
rule approved by learn everywhere
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
program which has been pointed out and
 
02:34:06.269 --> 02:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
in fact the proposed statutory language
 
02:34:08.389 --> 02:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
itself references the program rules
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
which is I would say is not a good
 
02:34:11.990 --> 02:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
practice in terms of you don't want to
 
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
reference rules in statute because then
 
02:34:17.070 --> 02:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
that makes the rules the statute um um
 
02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
there is no logical reason to implement
 
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
this policy unless the goal is to limit
 
02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity and harm these students and
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
I am certain that that could not be the
 
02:34:27.630 --> 02:34:27.640 align:start position:0%
case thank you for allowing me to meet
 
02:34:30.269 --> 02:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
with you and address this today and I
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
can answer any questions people might
 
02:34:32.910 --> 02:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much commissioner are
 
02:34:35.269 --> 02:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
02:34:38.590 --> 02:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee representa Tanner thank you
 
02:34:40.269 --> 02:34:40.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
actually I have two questions if I can
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
have a followup my first one is um that
 
02:34:49.269 --> 02:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
354a applies to employment whereas the
 
02:34:52.030 --> 02:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination statutes under uh the
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
education laws apply to education so
 
02:34:58.349 --> 02:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
even though like groni or some of these
 
02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
other wonderful places that you've
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh do subscribe to the
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
antidiscrimination laws can can't they
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
still refuse to allow a student to come
 
02:35:12.070 --> 02:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
into their group uh who wishes to be you
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
know to do a um coffee and uh is has a
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
disability that they may have to do uh
 
02:35:22.150 --> 02:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
some modification for yeah so thank you
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
for that question so in fact the statute
 
02:35:26.269 --> 02:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
that's referenced here has nothing to do
 
02:35:27.790 --> 02:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
with anti-discrimination it has to do
 
02:35:29.469 --> 02:35:29.479 align:start position:0%
with an anti-discrimination policy
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
that's what the 19339 is dealing with
 
02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
all of these other entities are subject
 
02:35:35.670 --> 02:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
354a and the federal uh Title 9 title 7
 
02:35:41.790 --> 02:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination Provisions so for
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
example you know any of these businesses
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
if someone walks in you can't
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
discriminate them against them based on
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
their race their disability or any of
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
those things so all of those laws apply
 
02:35:55.269 --> 02:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
to all of these entities there is not
 
02:35:57.790 --> 02:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
something uh new or unique to the
 
02:35:59.910 --> 02:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
schools the schools as well are subject
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
to anti-discrimination Provisions just
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
like these other entities are and the
 
02:36:06.030 --> 02:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
only difference is in this particular
 
02:36:07.349 --> 02:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
statute you require them to have a
 
02:36:07.359 --> 02:36:09.070 align:start position:0%
statute you require them to have a
specific

02:36:09.070 --> 02:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:36:11.150 --> 02:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
policy further questions from the
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee I think she said she had two
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
but I didn't the other the other one was
 
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
recently the learn everywhere program
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
dropped their a background check uh uh
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
provision and I'm just wondering why
 
02:36:26.030 --> 02:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
that happened yeah so that was adjusted
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the rules to make the learn
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere programs more accessible for
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
the local schools um because as you know
 
02:36:34.269 --> 02:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere is basically kind of a
 
02:36:36.990 --> 02:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
state Extended Learning opportunity um
 
02:36:38.990 --> 02:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
and some of the schools have actually
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
taken up the learn everywhere programs
 
02:36:43.230 --> 02:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
and adopted them into their schools as
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
Extended Learning opportunities and none
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
of the schools learn everywhere programs
 
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
had that type of a background check so
 
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
it was limiting the school's
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
ability further questions represent Hall
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you said the
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
effect of this bill would have a uh
 
02:37:04.030 --> 02:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
would limit the uh unique Hands-On
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
experiences for particularly
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged kids can you give a
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
specific example of that sure I'd love
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
to tell you a story about a kid over in
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale I was visiting the school one
 
02:37:15.359 --> 02:37:16.510 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale I was visiting the school one
day

02:37:16.510 --> 02:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:37:19.469 --> 02:37:19.479 align:start position:0%
and um this particular student uh was
 
02:37:20.910 --> 02:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
characterized to me as not a
 
02:37:23.070 --> 02:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
particularly good student at at risk of
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
dropping out of school um I had the
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to meet with them uh during
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
a lunch in
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
program and uh I was talking to the kid
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
I was like you know what's up like they
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
tell me you're not doing that well in
 
02:37:36.150 --> 02:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
school that you're at risk of dropping
 
02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
out like what's going on and it was just
 
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
like I just don't like school it seems
 
02:37:41.670 --> 02:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
boring it's just they it's it's coercive
 
02:37:42.990 --> 02:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
they're telling what to do all the time
 
02:37:44.110 --> 02:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
and I just want to learn I just want to
 
02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
do my thing so this particular student
 
02:37:48.750 --> 02:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
had an outside of school learning
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
experience at a contractor working with
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
a contractor um the particular school
 
02:37:56.550 --> 02:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
has a block schedule so this student was
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to leave school during the third
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
block and there was a building
 
02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
construction project near the school and
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
they would go and for 90 minutes every
 
02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
day they would go and they would work on
 
02:38:07.870 --> 02:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
this particular construction project
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
later in the day I was continuing my
 
02:38:12.990 --> 02:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
tour of the school and I went into an AP
 
02:38:14.670 --> 02:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
Physics class an advanced placement
 
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
physics class and this student was in
 
02:38:19.630 --> 02:38:19.640 align:start position:0%
there I was a little shocked truthfully
 
02:38:21.469 --> 02:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and I said you know I I was like what
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
are you doing in here this is AP Physics
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is not supposed to be for you know
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
kids who are at risk of dropping out
 
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
while you're here and I asked the
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
teacher how's he doing he says he's
 
02:38:31.349 --> 02:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
doing great I said well what's going on
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
and he said a couple of things he said
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
first of all here in physics what I'm
 
02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
learning are the very things I'm
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
learning on the construction site like I
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
go out and I can see kind of what a
 
02:38:43.389 --> 02:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
candle lever is how the roof is pitched
 
02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
and how the weight load is you know in
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
the construction and how that all works
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
and he said so it makes the learning
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
that I have much more engaging and then
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
the second thing he said is and I get to
 
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
leave at the third period so I get to
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
move around right I get I feel like I
 
02:39:00.190 --> 02:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
get I have freedom right I get to go and
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
I get to move and then I come back to
 
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
school and I feel like I can sit down I
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
can concentrate for this fourth period
 
02:39:08.429 --> 02:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
this fourth uh Block in his schedule so
 
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
that is an example of a student who um
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
is taking advantage of these outside of
 
02:39:14.510 --> 02:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
school learning
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities and and by doing so they
 
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
are then bringing that success back into
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
their education so that they can be
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
successful yes so follow up um so what
 
02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
would this bill how would this bill
 
02:39:31.230 --> 02:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
prevent that from happening because it's
 
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
unlikely that that Builder is going to
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
install a policy relative to
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination that Builder is
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
already Bound by the anti-discrimination
 
02:39:43.150 --> 02:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
laws so that Builder if I went to them
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
and says not only do you have to comply
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
with the anti discrimination laws not
 
02:39:49.230 --> 02:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
only do you have to among these other
 
02:39:52.030 --> 02:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
800 businesses and organizations open up
 
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
your building and and your business and
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
create opportunities for students but
 
02:39:57.110 --> 02:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
we're also going to require you to
 
02:39:58.630 --> 02:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
implement the same policy that the
 
02:40:00.670 --> 02:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
school district has when in fact there's
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
no value associated with it you heard
 
02:40:05.309 --> 02:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
testimony up here before that even in
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
the schools that require this policy we
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
still have discrimination taking place
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I would tell you is that
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
it will limit those opportunities
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
because they are going to be more
 
02:40:19.269 --> 02:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
resistant from these organizations
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
participating and allowing students to
 
02:40:23.429 --> 02:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
participate in their programming thank
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
02:40:27.950 --> 02:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent Balon thank you Mr chair
 
02:40:29.990 --> 02:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a new representative so I don't know
 
02:40:35.230 --> 02:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
about the program um but could you
 
02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
please explain to me what is the
 
02:40:39.309 --> 02:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
difference between the learn everywhere
 
02:40:42.190 --> 02:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
program and uh the opportunities
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
presented in that program versus the um
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
Extended learn learning opportunities
 
02:40:49.429 --> 02:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
program um monitored by the school
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
districts so they are very similar
 
02:40:53.830 --> 02:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
programs in the sense that an Extended
 
02:40:55.469 --> 02:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunity is a learn
 
02:40:57.790 --> 02:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere program that is generated out
 
02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
of the local school district and the
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
student is participating a learn
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere program is an Extended
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunity that is generated
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
out of the state and afforded to all the
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
students across the state um part of the
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
purpose there is really not all
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
districts have the ability to establish
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
and set up and support students in those
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
learn in those Extended Learning
 
02:41:20.510 --> 02:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities and so learn everywhere
 
02:41:22.750 --> 02:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
programs essentially bring Extended
 
02:41:24.590 --> 02:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunities to all school
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
students all all children in our schools
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
across the state yes um and a followup
 
02:41:34.269 --> 02:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
um credits are awarded for these
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities I know in local school
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
districts they determine how those
 
02:41:41.870 --> 02:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
credits are awarded how does the state
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
determine how those credits are awarded
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes so just to be clear so with the
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
students in the learn everywhere program
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
aren't awarded credits they're awarded
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
credit certificates which are redeemable
 
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
for credit at the local high school so
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
it kind of has that same effect and the
 
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
way that those credits are awarded is
 
02:41:57.910 --> 02:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
that the programs are assessing whether
 
02:41:59.590 --> 02:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
or not the students have met
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
competencies and uh So based upon the
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
student meeting competencies the way
 
02:42:06.910 --> 02:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
that our uh State rule regulatory schema
 
02:42:09.389 --> 02:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
works if a student has demonstrated
 
02:42:11.190 --> 02:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
Mastery of competencies they're required
 
02:42:13.349 --> 02:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
to be wed
 
02:42:15.590 --> 02:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
credit so I'll give you an example of
 
02:42:17.030 --> 02:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that works sure well give me I'll give
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
you an example of how that works and so
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
in our first robotics program so first
 
02:42:22.309 --> 02:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
robotics is a uh a learn everywhere
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
program and so you have the mentors of
 
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
the first robotics team who are signing
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
off that a student has met uh
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
engineering competencies or that they've
 
02:42:33.269 --> 02:42:33.279 align:start position:0%
signed off that they've met coding
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
competencies or they signed off that
 
02:42:37.469 --> 02:42:37.479 align:start position:0%
they've met uh business competencies um
 
02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
and so that is how we assess those
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
competencies and it's different for each
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
program um so it is actually
 
02:42:48.670 --> 02:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
the the organization through learn
 
02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
enware determines the certificate or the
 
02:42:55.070 --> 02:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
recommended credits and then this but
 
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
again and then the receiving High School
 
02:43:00.269 --> 02:43:00.279 align:start position:0%
is required to accept those credits as
 
02:43:02.309 --> 02:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
listed if they've met the competencies
 
02:43:04.389 --> 02:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the organization is
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
signing off that the student has met the
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
competencies and then they get a
 
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
certificate that they've met those
 
02:43:13.110 --> 02:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
competencies which under existing law if
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
a student has met competencies they're
 
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
required to receive
 
02:43:20.110 --> 02:43:20.120 align:start position:0%
credit got it thank you thank you
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner um thank you and thank
 
02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so we're
 
02:43:26.389 --> 02:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
talking about competencies this just
 
02:43:29.469 --> 02:43:29.479 align:start position:0%
kind of you know um in a school the
 
02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
competencies and the rubrics and
 
02:43:33.030 --> 02:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
everything are generated within the
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
local school district um are there
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide competencies I mean how does
 
02:43:42.190 --> 02:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
um somebody in robotics that's a mentor
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh determine do they write up a
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
competency for engineering or the person
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
at uh the coffee shop do they write up a
 
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
competency for um I don't know counting
 
02:43:55.070 --> 02:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
change or whatever they you know the
 
02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
competency is how is how is that
 
02:43:59.790 --> 02:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
actually done yeah so it's going to
 
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
depend upon the individual program but
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
we've got Statewide academic standards
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and a competency is essentially a
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
compilation of Standards so certain
 
02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
number of Standards add up to meeting a
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
competency the state has model
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
competencies that we do have available
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
but most of our learn everywhere
 
02:44:18.870 --> 02:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
programs are borrowing uh competencies
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
from local schools and saying okay
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
here's a competency that would might be
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
used just as so uh if it's used by a
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
local school um then but the local
 
02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
school doesn't actually have any in a
 
02:44:35.269 --> 02:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
learn everywhere program there's not a
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
person from the school that actually
 
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
oversees the program like it is in an
 
02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
ELO where they actually uh go out and
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
talk to the person in in robotics or
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
they they they monitor the student there
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
um how does the local school make sure
 
02:44:55.150 --> 02:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
that their competency is being met if
 
02:44:58.830 --> 02:44:58.840 align:start position:0%
they if the mentor is uh in main
 
02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
blasting uh you know rock or whatever I
 
02:45:04.510 --> 02:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
mean how how does how does that work
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
how's the uh coordination yes a great
 
02:45:07.950 --> 02:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate that so
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
essentially what happens is and it's not
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
dissimilar to um an Extended Learning
 
02:45:16.110 --> 02:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity so a student is out at a uh
 
02:45:17.550 --> 02:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
you know Extended Learning opportunity
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
or learn everywhere program and the
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
program itself is acknowledging that the
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
student has met the competencies right
 
02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
so the competencies for all the learn
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere programs for Extended
 
02:45:28.550 --> 02:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunities are mapped out in
 
02:45:29.950 --> 02:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
the program and they're approved by the
 
02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education and then the
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
program itself is acknowledging that the
 
02:45:36.190 --> 02:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
student has met those competencies so if
 
02:45:37.950 --> 02:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
we were to use the example of first
 
02:45:40.590 --> 02:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
robotics uh you've got Engineers from
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
bos or bae or Deca you know sign off and
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
saying like this kid can code he's got
 
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
it right he knows how to do that work
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
and even in an Extended Learning
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity an Extended Learning
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity coordinator is generally
 
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
relying on the program itself if a if a
 
02:45:58.910 --> 02:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
student is doing a PE credit at Tokyo
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
Joe's right they're relying on Tokyo Joe
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to acknowledge that the
 
02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
student has met the PE
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements represent
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
pelli thank you thank you for being here
 
02:46:14.070 --> 02:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner um I'm just wondering um
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
the last part of the bill how do you
 
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
envision the State Board of Education
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
annually determining if these 800
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
entities comply with state and federal
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws so so I'm not
 
02:46:30.150 --> 02:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure that that would be possible for
 
02:46:31.830 --> 02:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyone you would have to actually go in
 
02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
and do a have a full-fledged monitoring
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
program um you know because it depends
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
on what you anticipate as a as
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
legislature when you say the State Board
 
02:46:42.030 --> 02:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
of Education shall annually review all
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
entities does that mean that I send a
 
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
team of individual ual to each of these
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
800 plus businesses um you know to allow
 
02:46:51.150 --> 02:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
that to happen I'm not sure that that's
 
02:46:53.550 --> 02:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
going to be possible um you know we've
 
02:46:56.670 --> 02:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
got a uh I believe it's called kigo is
 
02:46:58.590 --> 02:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
one of our foreign language programs
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
which is based out of Costa Rica for
 
02:47:02.469 --> 02:47:02.479 align:start position:0%
Spanish language program uh so I'll go
 
02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
to Costa Rica uh in Winter and and
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
monitor that particular program but so
 
02:47:07.950 --> 02:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what you're anticipating
 
02:47:10.790 --> 02:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
there but it does feel a bit unworkable
 
02:47:13.630 --> 02:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
you San Jose itd be kind of fun it might
 
02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
be fun in the winter representa Cornell
 
02:47:18.269 --> 02:47:18.279 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:47:20.349 --> 02:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
question I can't find learn anywhere on
 
02:47:22.349 --> 02:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
the state department the department of
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
education's website because I want to
 
02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
look and see you know how many students
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
are getting credits at their schools for
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
for what do you know what to look under
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
sure if you just go under education
 
02:47:34.990 --> 02:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
programming there's this and it's called
 
02:47:36.269 --> 02:47:36.279 align:start position:0%
Uh there's two places that you can
 
02:47:37.389 --> 02:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
navigate to it I think it's called
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
learning outside of school and then
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
under that you'll find one of them is
 
02:47:43.150 --> 02:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
about learn everywhere okay and and that
 
02:47:45.389 --> 02:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
will tell me what it will provide all
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
the information that we have relative to
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
the program yes okay so we do have a
 
02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
list of what schools are granting credit
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
to students and we publish that every
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
year in September okay thank you further
 
02:47:58.190 --> 02:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
question representa
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chair commissioner
 
02:48:02.110 --> 02:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning still than
 
02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
still let's get it done yes a pleasure
 
02:48:06.590 --> 02:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
to see you here it's infrequent I'm glad
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're here uh you you were discussing
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
the curriculum competencies and the
 
02:48:13.389 --> 02:48:13.399 align:start position:0%
coordination between the elos and the
 
02:48:16.349 --> 02:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
external learning to those
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of our curriculum competencies
 
02:48:21.950 --> 02:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
and from the state house from the doe uh
 
02:48:23.950 --> 02:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
and all our curriculum areas can you
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
just give us a quick snapshot of where
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
they are in 2024 how updated they are
 
02:48:31.150 --> 02:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
how frequent they are are they all I'm
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand the question maybe
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
you could repeat that curriculum
 
02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
standards in the corer academic
 
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
standards schools academic standards can
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
you tell us and people use those the
 
02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
guides um where we are in terms of
 
02:48:42.870 --> 02:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
updating or how current they are in in
 
02:48:45.469 --> 02:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
AC yes so they're in various you know
 
02:48:47.710 --> 02:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
ages depending on uh you know when they
 
02:48:50.190 --> 02:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
were last adopted you know so math and
 
02:48:52.110 --> 02:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
we use the Common Core St academic
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
standards for Math and English language
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
arts and that was in 2012 adopted I
 
02:48:59.309 --> 02:48:59.319 align:start position:0%
believe in 2014 um we've got other
 
02:49:00.990 --> 02:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
standards and I don't know the dates for
 
02:49:02.590 --> 02:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
each of the other standard areas but
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably older than that okay so if mat
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so for that same in the
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
same line thinking then so if schools
 
02:49:12.429 --> 02:49:12.439 align:start position:0%
are trying to and I'm not trying to jam
 
02:49:13.550 --> 02:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
you up here if schools are trying to
 
02:49:17.670 --> 02:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
follow these okay wait if chairman will
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
stop me if the schools are trying to
 
02:49:20.670 --> 02:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
follow these competencies and they're
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
already a decade behind Yeah by your own
 
02:49:25.229 --> 02:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
admission and which is fine they decade
 
02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
behind how are we going to get or when
 
02:49:29.910 --> 02:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
are these schools going to get current
 
02:49:31.550 --> 02:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
competencies like the social science or
 
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
math or English we just talking about
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
that are 2024 and Beyond if we're
 
02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
already decade behind now where are we
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the revision piece yeah so what I can
 
02:49:39.670 --> 02:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
tell you is that you have to understand
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
that you know these are academic
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
standards which truthfully have not
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't need and have not Chang
 
02:49:48.590 --> 02:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
substantively for decades and the math
 
02:49:50.269 --> 02:49:50.279 align:start position:0%
that you learned is much of the same
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
math that we want our kids to learn
 
02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
today uh so whether it was a math
 
02:49:57.070 --> 02:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
standard that was written in 1950 or in
 
02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
1960 or 1970 or in 2012 you'll see if
 
02:50:03.309 --> 02:50:03.319 align:start position:0%
you go read those standards you know in
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
the younger grades we wanted to have
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
basic numeracy we want to be able to do
 
02:50:08.229 --> 02:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
addition and subtraction as they get
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
further Advanced we went on to do you
 
02:50:13.070 --> 02:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
know like some statistics and algebra
 
02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
and then we get into trigonometry so uh
 
02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
much of the content standards are stuff
 
02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
that we expect our students to be to go
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
to school to learn and there's not
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's not an area that you have some
 
02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
rapid evolution in okay and pleas yeah
 
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
last one thank thank you Mr chairman
 
02:50:36.309 --> 02:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
across the state um are you comfort how
 
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable you saying that across the
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
state our school are currently fallowing
 
02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
competencies um so I know that that is
 
02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:47.800 align:start position:0%
the um the rule that they're required to
 
02:50:50.389 --> 02:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh award Credits based on students uh
 
02:50:52.710 --> 02:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
achieving competencies so that is the
 
02:50:57.070 --> 02:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:59.630 --> 02:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
implementing last one last Point wait a
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.150 --> 02:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
one I won't do more this you got a proxy
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
from somebody else here yes go for
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
it so just just back to that that
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
comment CP done so if the schools if the
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
schools are doing that um and they're
 
02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing that my question
 
02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
view is and we hear frequently from
 
02:51:26.710 --> 02:51:26.720 align:start position:0%
school folks that are here that their
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
schools are not doing that so my
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
question is how how does the doe
 
02:51:32.790 --> 02:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
oversight besid the spok to I don't say
 
02:51:34.229 --> 02:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
the spokes to be but how do they
 
02:51:36.670 --> 02:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
actually go and monitor or regulate that
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
they are doing those compens yeah so
 
02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's principally through we basically
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
have an output accountability system
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
associated with students assessment and
 
02:51:45.229 --> 02:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
then we have a input accountability
 
02:51:47.550 --> 02:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
system which is pbass where schools are
 
02:51:50.150 --> 02:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
reporting to us what they are doing um
 
02:51:52.590 --> 02:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
and then we follow up on that okay thank
 
02:51:55.710 --> 02:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair with represent
 
02:51:57.870 --> 02:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:51:59.910 --> 02:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question it's a followup to
 
02:52:02.750 --> 02:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
part of Representative woodcock's um
 
02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
inquiries so I appreciate your response
 
02:52:08.670 --> 02:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
that for example in math what we need to
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
teach has not changed for decades
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
probably but as a science
 
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
and a historian I think what we would
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
want to be teaching in 2024 there's a
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
much greater body of
 
02:52:26.070 --> 02:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge than there was in 2000 or
 
02:52:28.429 --> 02:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
1980s so where are we at on updating
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
those standards so I believe that the
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
ngss standards were adopted by the State
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
Board of Education in
 
02:52:36.349 --> 02:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
2017 so they are more current so you
 
02:52:39.150 --> 02:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
know a body a a standard that needs a
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
more frequent refreshing is probably
 
02:52:41.950 --> 02:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
going to be more refreshed than
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't to your point so
 
02:52:47.229 --> 02:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
2017 I believe was when they were last
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
adopted further questions from the
 
02:52:52.910 --> 02:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee represent Tanner so I just I
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
want to kind of get back to the bill
 
02:52:56.830 --> 02:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
itself and about the anti-discrimination
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
and again that 354 deals with employees
 
02:53:00.720 --> 02:53:01.590 align:start position:0%
and again that 354 deals with employees
and

02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:04.269 --> 02:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
employers and and as you said the
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
customers coming in but our
 
02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws under 193 are
 
02:53:11.550 --> 02:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
quite different um because they apply to
 
02:53:13.590 --> 02:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
students and the right of a student to
 
02:53:15.710 --> 02:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
get an adequate education and a few
 
02:53:17.790 --> 02:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
other things and I'm just wondering and
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
I think if if I had you write if I read
 
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
if I was hearing what you were saying
 
02:53:25.229 --> 02:53:25.239 align:start position:0%
was that you just think it would be too
 
02:53:28.750 --> 02:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for uh people that the like
 
02:53:30.990 --> 02:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
the Builder that this that that the kid
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
went to um that it would be too
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
cumbersome for them to
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
um to to write a pol to follow this the
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
193 policy and uh that that's your main
 
02:53:47.510 --> 02:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
objection to this bill is that was I
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
hearing that correctly so I just want to
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
correct the record because you indicated
 
02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
that uh 354a doesn't apply when in fact
 
02:53:57.070 --> 02:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
19339 specifically references
 
02:53:59.590 --> 02:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
354a um stating that each school
 
02:54:01.349 --> 02:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
district and Charter Public School shall
 
02:54:02.790 --> 02:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
develop a policy that guides the
 
02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
development and implementation of a
 
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
coordinated plan to prevent assess uh
 
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
the presence of intervene in and respond
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
to incidences of discrimination um on
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
the basis of age sex gender identity
 
02:54:15.950 --> 02:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation race color marital
 
02:54:17.469 --> 02:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
status familial status disability
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
religion national origin or any other
 
02:54:20.910 --> 02:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
class protected under
 
02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
354a and so 354a is an anti and 354 is
 
02:54:28.349 --> 02:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
an anti-discrimination statute which
 
02:54:31.150 --> 02:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
applies to our schools like if a student
 
02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
walks into a school and somebody says
 
02:54:35.469 --> 02:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
you know and they discriminate them
 
02:54:39.469 --> 02:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
based upon religion right that is a 354
 
02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
violation and that school and whoever
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
perpetrates that honor would be in
 
02:54:45.070 --> 02:54:45.080 align:start position:0%
violation of discrimination ation
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
subject to the provisions of that
 
02:54:48.190 --> 02:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
statute the statute that you're
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
referring to here requires our public
 
02:54:53.349 --> 02:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
schools to as it says each School
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
District shall develop a policy that
 
02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
guides for the development and
 
02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
implementation of a coordinated plan to
 
02:55:01.269 --> 02:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
prevent blah BL blah right and so what
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is that that is going to be
 
02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
an obstacle if I go to FedEx and I say
 
02:55:09.229 --> 02:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
to FedEx in londondary I want you to
 
02:55:11.910 --> 02:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
implement this policy FedEx and lunder
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
is not going to be able to they're going
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
to have to go back to corporate
 
02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
headquarters in Tennessee they're going
 
02:55:17.190 --> 02:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
to have to talk to Tennessee to see
 
02:55:19.269 --> 02:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
whether they can get it and essentially
 
02:55:20.590 --> 02:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is this become
 
02:55:22.429 --> 02:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
this bureaucracy that probably it won't
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
happen and students will not be able to
 
02:55:26.910 --> 02:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
go there and I think that you will find
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
that same effect when you try to impose
 
02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
a school policy requirement on
 
02:55:36.429 --> 02:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
Commercial entities that are already by
 
02:55:39.150 --> 02:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
Statute prevented from discrimination so
 
02:55:43.030 --> 02:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
again a solution looking for a
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
problem but thank you very much there
 
02:55:46.750 --> 02:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:48.229 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
representative

02:55:48.229 --> 02:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:55:50.150 --> 02:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hall so I'm going to go back to that
 
02:55:51.550 --> 02:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
contractor one more time I think this
 
02:55:53.790 --> 02:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
third time here uh does that person have
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
to apply any paperwork that goes along
 
02:55:59.150 --> 02:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
with that kid going to the contractor so
 
02:56:00.469 --> 02:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
if we're referring to learn everywhere
 
02:56:01.870 --> 02:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
program so every learn everywhere
 
02:56:04.150 --> 02:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
program has to come to the State Board
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
of Education they fill out a complete
 
02:56:09.429 --> 02:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
application um it is reviewed by the
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education it was
 
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
interesting there was a comment that
 
02:56:15.150 --> 02:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
indicated somebody said that um somebody
 
02:56:16.389 --> 02:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
was approved as learn everywhere and
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
didn't go through the process and I can
 
02:56:19.950 --> 02:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
tell you that that's 100% false that's
 
02:56:21.910 --> 02:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
never happened for any learn everywhere
 
02:56:23.710 --> 02:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
program the State Board of Education
 
02:56:25.429 --> 02:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
gets so first of all I have to sign off
 
02:56:26.910 --> 02:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
on the application then the applications
 
02:56:28.469 --> 02:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
go to the State Board of Education
 
02:56:29.790 --> 02:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
Without the application the State Board
 
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
would have nothing to act on so uh they
 
02:56:34.389 --> 02:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
have to fill out an application it
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
enumerates the program it enumerates the
 
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
policies of their organization it
 
02:56:41.229 --> 02:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
enumerates the uh you know the um you
 
02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
know the credits that are earned and the
 
02:56:44.309 --> 02:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
competencies and how they'll be earned
 
02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
that is voted on by the State Board of
 
02:56:47.389 --> 02:56:47.399 align:start position:0%
Education they get what's referred to as
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
a provisional license under the current
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
rules um after a year we go back and we
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
revisit the program make sure they're
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what they told us they
 
02:56:56.590 --> 02:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
were doing if they are then they get a
 
02:56:58.830 --> 02:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
renewal for a fiveyear Orient you know
 
02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
fiveyear renewal process just like all
 
02:57:02.349 --> 02:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
of the schools at that point in time so
 
02:57:04.269 --> 02:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
they have quite a bit of followup and
 
02:57:05.830 --> 02:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
and Assurance to make sure they're
 
02:57:07.710 --> 02:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
actually doing what they told us that
 
02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
they would do and I think there was a
 
02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
question over here we've not had
 
02:57:13.389 --> 02:57:13.399 align:start position:0%
complaints about discrimination in these
 
02:57:13.399 --> 02:57:15.110 align:start position:0%
complaints about discrimination in these
programs

02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:16.190 align:start position:0%

1093 uh 1093 is a bill prohibiting
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory mask policies in schools and
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to welcome representative
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
Noble good afternoon chairman lad and
 
04:12:01.950 --> 04:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
Kristen Noble and I represent Hillsboro
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
District 2 the town of
 
04:12:06.279 --> 04:12:07.790 align:start position:0%
District 2 the town of
Bedford

04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
Bedford
 
04:12:10.109 --> 04:12:10.119 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing this bill forward for two
 
04:12:12.830 --> 04:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
reasons one is to make sure that
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
children are never forced to wear a mask
 
04:12:21.149 --> 04:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
to attend school ever again and two to
 
04:12:24.109 --> 04:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully rebuild some of the trust that
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
was lost between parents and the
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
schools there should be no question now
 
04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't just the lockdowns that
 
04:12:36.109 --> 04:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
were detrimental to children but forcing
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
them to wear masks also had serious and
 
04:12:39.080 --> 04:12:40.590 align:start position:0%
them to wear masks also had serious and
Lasting

04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
Lasting
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
consequences masking kids had a negative
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
impact on their learning their speech
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
their mental and emotional well-being
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
their physical health and their Social
 
04:12:55.950 --> 04:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
Development if you didn't have kids in
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
the public school at that time as I did
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
you may not know what kids went through
 
04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
besides the remote learning and The
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
Masks so so we had several mental health
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
work sessions in here and
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
um that kind of triggered me to to ask
 
04:13:19.229 --> 04:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
the parents um that I was still
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
connected to from from back then we
 
04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
still have a group text and I asked them
 
04:13:27.510 --> 04:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
to remind me of some of the things that
 
04:13:30.269 --> 04:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
our kids went through during that
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
time so U let me just summarize that for
 
04:13:36.189 --> 04:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
you they were made to wear masks for
 
04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
hours a day in school school on the bus
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
during gym class at recess
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
outdoors and even while playing
 
04:13:48.429 --> 04:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
instruments students were repeatedly
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
told that they would get their family
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
members sick if they didn't keep their
 
04:13:53.279 --> 04:13:54.510 align:start position:0%
members sick if they didn't keep their
masks

04:13:54.510 --> 04:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
masks
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
up at lunch they had to sit far apart
 
04:13:59.469 --> 04:13:59.479 align:start position:0%
from their friends separated by
 
04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
plexiglass or
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
cardboard some schools made them keep
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
their masks up when not actively eating
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
or drinking
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
at recess they had to play in zones not
 
04:14:15.070 --> 04:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
able to cross the lines to see their
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
friends in addition to their
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
education they were robbed of their
 
04:14:24.429 --> 04:14:24.439 align:start position:0%
Sports their proms their field trips
 
04:14:24.439 --> 04:14:25.750 align:start position:0%
Sports their proms their field trips
their

04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
friends their routines and
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
stability kids developed severe anxiety
 
04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
and depression Eating Disorders some
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
suicide I feel it's important to share
 
04:14:45.630 --> 04:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
this with you because at times I I I do
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
hear that there's a little irritation
 
04:14:49.950 --> 04:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
with parents sometimes I hear that in
 
04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
here and and I understand that it it's
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
been a difficult situation for everybody
 
04:14:59.950 --> 04:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
um but I feel that uh it things have
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
kind of snowballed a
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
bit so I just want you to understand the
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
parent perspective
 
04:15:11.189 --> 04:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
and I want you to know that we felt
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
kids go through
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
this and that is the source of a lot of
 
04:15:24.109 --> 04:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
anger that you
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
see we knew that this was a catastrophe
 
04:15:31.550 --> 04:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
for kids and it fell on deaf ears all
 
04:15:33.149 --> 04:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
state the state did not have a mask
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
mandate for schools
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
K through 12 students and teachers were
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
exempt from the governor's mask
 
04:15:45.550 --> 04:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
mandate yet no District that I know of
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
stuck to that and just went with
 
04:15:47.880 --> 04:15:49.229 align:start position:0%
stuck to that and just went with
personal

04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
personal
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
choice they created the Mandate
 
04:15:53.550 --> 04:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
themselves which was also allowed under
 
04:15:55.790 --> 04:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
order in August of last year as kids
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
were heading off to college covid cases
 
04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
were on the rise and a lot of colleges
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
and universities around the country were
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
imposing mask mandates again this caused
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of anxiety with parents of
 
04:16:15.429 --> 04:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
younger kids because they did not want
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
their kids masked
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
again so I decided to put this bill
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
in uh some of you have seen this bill
 
04:16:27.030 --> 04:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
before it's um HB 1131 from
 
04:16:29.550 --> 04:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
2022 it's not the bill as introduced
 
04:16:31.990 --> 04:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
though it's the um Senate Amendment so
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any penalties or
 
04:16:35.870 --> 04:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
04:16:35.880 --> 04:16:37.550 align:start position:0%
anything like
that

04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not stop anyone from
 
04:16:44.349 --> 04:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
wearing a mask if they choose it just
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
ensures that it will always be left up
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
to parents to decide whether or not to
 
04:16:50.189 --> 04:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
mask their
 
04:16:52.750 --> 04:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
children I think passing this bill would
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
be a huge step in rebuilding trust which
 
04:16:59.710 --> 04:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
really needs to happen and I hope you
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
will support it thank you thank you very
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%

Royal Society of medicine and it
 
04:18:52.030 --> 04:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
concluded that
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
quote overall there is a lack of
 
04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
substantial evidence to support claims
 
04:19:00.910 --> 04:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
that face masks protect from infectious
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
contamination now in that quote as I
 
04:19:06.109 --> 04:19:06.119 align:start position:0%
quoted it there's some dot dot dot
 
04:19:06.119 --> 04:19:07.429 align:start position:0%

04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
I want to tell you what I left out I
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
also want to tell you something else
 
04:19:12.030 --> 04:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
surprising there's a couple of

surprising
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
details first that article was written
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
in 2015 5 years before the covid
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic and second the words I left out
 
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
the complete quote is overall there's a
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
lack of substantial evidence to support
 
04:19:28.269 --> 04:19:28.279 align:start position:0%
claims that face masks protect either
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
patient or surgeon from infectious
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
contamination the title of the article
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
is unmasking the surgeons the
 
04:19:37.269 --> 04:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
evidence-based behind the use of face
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
masks in surgery so this article shows
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
that there was skepticism regarding the
 
04:19:46.109 --> 04:19:46.119 align:start position:0%
efficacy of face masks years before Co
 
04:19:47.790 --> 04:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
even among
 
04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
surgeons my own skepticism about face
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
masks began when I saw a video showing a
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
man outside wearing multiple face masks
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
of all different varieties when he
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
breathes no matter what type of mask or
 
04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
how many masks he was wearing you could
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
see his breath The Masks were apparently
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
useless and containing the water vapor
 
04:20:09.950 --> 04:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
upon which microorganisms
 
04:20:14.189 --> 04:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
travel Dr Harvey R Professor emitis
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
ritis I'm sorry I'm not pronouncing that
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
correctly of epidemiology at Yale has
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
said that wearing masks to block virus
 
04:20:24.750 --> 04:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
is like quote putting up a chain link
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
fence and hoping that it blocks
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes even Dr Anthony fouchy in a
 
04:20:33.990 --> 04:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
February 5th 2020 email wrote quote the
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
typical face the typical mask you buy in
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
the drugstore is not really effective in
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
keeping out virus which is small enough
 
04:20:43.550 --> 04:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
to pass through the material a Cochran
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
Institute study I don't mean to
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelm you I'm just there's not not
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
too much more here a Cochran Institute
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
Study last year concluded that quote
 
04:20:53.590 --> 04:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
wearing masks in the community probably
 
04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
makes little or no difference to the
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
outcome of covid-19 like illness
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
compared to not wearing
 
04:21:03.469 --> 04:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
masks okay so all of this shows that it
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
brings into Reasonable Doubt I'm not
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
here to prove this is a reasonable
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
substantial reasonable doubt that masss
 
04:21:11.359 --> 04:21:12.469 align:start position:0%
substantial reasonable doubt that masss
are

04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:21:14.910 --> 04:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
ineffective beyond that there has been
 
04:21:14.920 --> 04:21:18.269 align:start position:0%
ineffective beyond that there has been
proven

04:21:18.269 --> 04:21:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:22.109 --> 04:21:22.119 align:start position:0%
harm there was a study in epidemiology
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
and infection and it actually suggested
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
that wearing a face mask may be
 
04:21:30.109 --> 04:21:30.119 align:start position:0%
associated with an increased risk of
 
04:21:32.910 --> 04:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
infection um another article I saw about
 
04:21:36.429 --> 04:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
k95 Mass said that they contained
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
Dreadful things um toxic volatile
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
organic compounds and these substances
 
04:21:42.750 --> 04:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
have been linked to seizures and Cancers
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
with concentrations eight times the
 
04:21:48.750 --> 04:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable safety limits something
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
called I don't even know if I'm
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
pronouncing this right cuz you know
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not a not a doctor okay but I for
 
04:21:57.030 --> 04:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
some reason started reading a lot of
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
medical journal articles because
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's just what I felt I needed to do
 
04:22:04.510 --> 04:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
phthalates these are widely used
 
04:22:06.670 --> 04:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
chemicals that disrupt human endoc
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
systems and impact human health these
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
have been found in face masks as have
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
some terrible the words like
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
microplastics nanoparticles um in the
 
04:22:20.149 --> 04:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
Journal of hazardous materials there was
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
a couple of Articles um finally uh just
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
two more
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
articles one of one of the Articles um
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
was about mask induced exhaustion
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
syndrome which sounded Dreadful and I
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
thought that that can't be good
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the article that I just want to
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
finish with was actually written just in
 
04:22:44.670 --> 04:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
December three months ago
 
04:22:47.469 --> 04:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
and I urge you perhaps I will send you
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
all an email just with a link to this
 
04:22:52.349 --> 04:22:52.359 align:start position:0%
one article because I think we all
 
04:22:54.269 --> 04:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
should read it it's from The Archives of
 
04:22:58.830 --> 04:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
disease in childhood published December
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%

04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
the study concluded quote real world I'm
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
going to quote sort of longer here
 
04:23:16.269 --> 04:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
because this is really important real
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
world effectiveness of child mask
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%

04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
high quality evidence the current body
 
04:23:24.109 --> 04:23:24.119 align:start position:0%
of scientific data does not support
 
04:23:26.790 --> 04:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
masking children for protection against
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
covid-19 we fail to find any evidence of
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
benefit from masking children child mask
 
04:23:37.109 --> 04:23:37.119 align:start position:0%
mandates fail a basic risk benefit
 
04:23:40.229 --> 04:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
analysis recommending recommending child
 
04:23:43.109 --> 04:23:43.119 align:start position:0%
masking is unsupported by current
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
scientific data and inconsistent with
 
04:23:48.910 --> 04:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
accepted ethical
 
04:23:51.309 --> 04:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
Norms this point that the study goes on
 
04:23:52.590 --> 04:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
it points out a lot of the negative
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%

representative Noble referred to a bill
 
04:24:12.269 --> 04:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago like this we've
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
learned so much more I don't know how we
 
04:24:18.030 --> 04:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
can deny that there's Reasonable Doubt
 
04:24:18.040 --> 04:24:19.149 align:start position:0%
can deny that there's Reasonable Doubt
about

04:24:19.149 --> 04:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:24:19.159 --> 04:24:21.309 align:start position:0%
about
masks

04:24:21.309 --> 04:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
masks
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
um this bill will not stop anyone who
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
wants to wear a mask from doing so those
 
04:24:29.109 --> 04:24:29.119 align:start position:0%
people who truly believe that face masks
 
04:24:30.750 --> 04:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
are an effective way to prevent the
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
transmission of contagious diseases can
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
certainly keep wearing them
 
04:24:39.790 --> 04:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
parents who want their kids to wear
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
masks if that if a situation should
 
04:24:43.710 --> 04:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
arise in which that becomes a thing
 
04:24:44.910 --> 04:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
again I don't see the CH children
 
04:24:47.389 --> 04:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
wearing them much but uh that they can
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
send them to school wearing the masks
 
04:24:52.189 --> 04:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
and if they believe the masks are so
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
effective then they should also believe
 
04:24:57.229 --> 04:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
that these masks will offer protection
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
against anyone choosing not to wear a
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
mask meanwhile reasonable doubts have
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
been raised by reputable sources a whole
 
04:25:09.550 --> 04:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.710 --> 04:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
computer reasonable doubts have been
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
raised about the benefits of maske
 
04:25:15.269 --> 04:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
wearing especially among children and
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
because of these reasonable doubts mask
 
04:25:20.109 --> 04:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
wearing should not be required in school
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
and HB 1093 ought to
 
04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
pass thank you very much and I would be
 
04:25:27.630 --> 04:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
happy to answer your questions but
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
please remember I'm not a doctor I just
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
read a lot of medical journal articles
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much are there any
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%

04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time in this
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon I come to you my vocation is
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
as a nurse um but I come to you also as
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
a foster mom who adopted my two little
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
boys Max and brat who were they're now
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
nine and 10 so they're about six seven
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
seven and eight during the pandemic um
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
max came to me um non-verbal and so of
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
course being able to see lips and
 
04:26:28.750 --> 04:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
working through speech therapy was a big
 
04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
part of his IEP but it was really Brett
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
the older one that took the biggest hit
 
04:26:34.990 --> 04:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
with this he was born four months
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
premature drug addict and his nervous
 
04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
system naturally um you know is very
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
sensitive so he was getting in trouble
 
04:26:47.070 --> 04:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
at school because he would chew on his
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
mask um his mask would come home
 
04:26:51.550 --> 04:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
stopping wet with you know as a
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
clinician anything that's warm dark
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
moist and you know naturally sugary is
 
04:26:59.189 --> 04:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
our saliva is a breeding Pichu dish for
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
bacteria we also become mouth breathers
 
04:27:05.030 --> 04:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
when we put a mask on where our our Nars
 
04:27:07.070 --> 04:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
our nostrils have little filaments to
 
04:27:09.950 --> 04:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
help clean before it gets into our body
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
so we're kind of bypassing Nature's
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
natural defense but here he is all day
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
long he would come home his mask was so
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
dirty so wet so disgusting and he was
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble time and time again
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
for chewing on his mask his teachers
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
were sending me home that they keep
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
telling him he's not listening so then
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
flapping just like a nervous Tech so we
 
04:27:36.750 --> 04:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
had to go through all his autistic
 
04:27:39.910 --> 04:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on all of that just in the
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
last 8 months has completely vanished
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
but it took us a year and a half for the
 
04:27:47.030 --> 04:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
nervous tick and he would go you know St
 
04:27:48.109 --> 04:27:48.119 align:start position:0%
the night with somebody and be like I'm
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
a flapper and they thought he was
 
04:27:51.550 --> 04:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
talking about you know that he farted or
 
04:27:53.229 --> 04:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
you know and he was like no I get EX you
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
know so his nervous system because of
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
the stress of this child wanting to
 
04:28:00.070 --> 04:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
please the adults knowing that he was
 
04:28:01.950 --> 04:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
chewing on his mask and continually
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
getting in trouble for that it came to a
 
04:28:06.910 --> 04:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
point the teacher was like we'll just
 
04:28:09.710 --> 04:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
pull it down over your face and to me as
 
04:28:11.950 --> 04:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
a parent if we're teaching children that
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
this is the rules but then we're also
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
teaching them it's okay to break the
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
rules that's also sending a bad message
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
to our children and that was happening
 
04:28:24.189 --> 04:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the school districts so in my
 
04:28:26.910 --> 04:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
opinion my experience with my two
 
04:28:29.550 --> 04:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
children would be let me as the parent
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
decide let me discern what the risk
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
reward is for my child to have the m
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
mask on to prevent them from Contracting
 
04:28:41.229 --> 04:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
a virus from someone else but when it's
 
04:28:44.030 --> 04:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
wet they're touching it mask when we go
 
04:28:46.990 --> 04:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
through our clinicals as clinicians
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
we're taught to Dawn on and Dawn off
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
with each
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
transaction you don't wear the same
 
04:28:55.750 --> 04:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
gloves and the same mask all day long
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
and you know that was something that I
 
04:28:59.830 --> 04:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
never understood through the pandemic
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
because it was like everything we had
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
been taught went out the window and yet
 
04:29:05.830 --> 04:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're letting our children go without
 
04:29:08.429 --> 04:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
any training about touching their face
 
04:29:10.990 --> 04:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
touching here touching here it actually
 
04:29:13.189 --> 04:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I believe it probably made
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
the spread of the virus worse than
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
better but if parents wanted to mask
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
their children certainly their
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
prerogative but to deny other children
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
from their learning experience and let
 
04:29:27.070 --> 04:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
us as parents discern what is right and
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
best for our children when we're paying
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
to have them educated and they have the
 
04:29:34.189 --> 04:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
right to be educated I would really hope
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
that going forward should be ever come
 
04:29:38.510 --> 04:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
against another pandemic that you would
 
04:29:41.109 --> 04:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
allow the parents to discern what is
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
emotionally mentally physically heart
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
mind and body best for their child and
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
their learning environment thank you for
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
your time thank you very much are there
 
04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
04:29:53.319 --> 04:29:55.469 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
represent

04:29:55.469 --> 04:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:29:58.510 --> 04:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good afternoon than question um
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
did you ever go to your local school
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
board and ask them about this yes very
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
much we actually have a large group um
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
that showed up pretty uh thank you yes
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions from
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you very much you're
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
SCD good afternoon
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon it's uh incredible to me that
 
04:30:31.109 --> 04:30:31.119 align:start position:0%
we're still uh on this topic uh four
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
years later but um I'd just like to
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
First address a couple of things that
 
04:30:37.630 --> 04:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
the representatives have already said so
 
04:30:40.990 --> 04:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
far about masks and their purpose um the
 
04:30:42.990 --> 04:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
analogy was made of a chain link fence
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
for Mas well actually sorry backing up
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
first masks are not purely about
 
04:30:51.710 --> 04:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
reducing incoming viruses to you it's
 
04:30:54.109 --> 04:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
about reducing the amount that spreads
 
04:30:58.590 --> 04:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
to others so all this focus on masks as
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
being you know sure you can send your
 
04:31:02.670 --> 04:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
own kid with a mask but it the
 
04:31:05.670 --> 04:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of a mask is through the
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
General like the more people wearing
 
04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
them the more effective they will be
 
04:31:11.309 --> 04:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
because it's about reducing transmission
 
04:31:15.149 --> 04:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
to others um the chainlink fence analogy
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
made about masks um is inaccurate
 
04:31:21.950 --> 04:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
because yes a virus itself is very small
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
and yes is is at that scale of the chain
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
link fence analogy but the viruses are
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
not contain you know they're not
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
floating in the atmosphere alone they're
 
04:31:33.429 --> 04:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
floating on water droplets and it's
 
04:31:34.990 --> 04:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
those water droplets that are much
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
bigger and and are being caught by The
 
04:31:40.030 --> 04:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
Mask um
 
04:31:43.389 --> 04:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
additionally um there was some unclear
 
04:31:45.630 --> 04:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
wording I think in the actual bill of
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
this text um saying uh there was sorry
 
04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
like can I just bring it up on my phone
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
the first thing was saying um there was
 
04:32:00.030 --> 04:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
a phrase unless another law uh is here
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh sorry um or is required by some other
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
section of the law um um I just have
 
04:32:09.149 --> 04:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
questions about what does that mean does
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
that mean that just another law saying a
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
mask enforcement would uh you know
 
04:32:17.229 --> 04:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
supersede this law um I have a further
 
04:32:22.269 --> 04:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
question of um it says
 
04:32:25.389 --> 04:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
uh the other exception here is is sports
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
related equipment um and it says or
 
04:32:30.630 --> 04:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
while where uh or to wear protective
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
equipment while handling chemicals fire
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
or other similar hazardous elements I a
 
04:32:37.950 --> 04:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
question about what does uh handling
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
mean in this case does this mean if you
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
were next to hazardous elements but not
 
04:32:43.950 --> 04:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
handling them uh I think there's just
 
04:32:46.670 --> 04:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
some vagueness with the wording there um
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
as well as other similar hazardous
 
04:32:52.109 --> 04:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
elements what does that entail what are
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
other similar hazardous elements that
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
just seems very vague to me uh would
 
04:32:58.990 --> 04:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
other uh similar hazardous elements
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
include like things like rock dust
 
04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
something that is extremely necessary uh
 
04:33:06.869 --> 04:33:06.879 align:start position:0%
and this this get back to the purpose of
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
masks masks um there are two levels of
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
like protective masks um or well there's
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
many more but there's like the higher
 
04:33:20.830 --> 04:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
level m95 masks which really actually do
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
not 100% but much more than the medical
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
masks the blue ones um actually do
 
04:33:29.070 --> 04:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
reduce incoming particles and that can
 
04:33:33.150 --> 04:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
be very uh necessary um for any sort of
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
rock dust uh
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
hazardous particulate matter um and this
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill you know seems to have an exception
 
04:33:44.429 --> 04:33:44.439 align:start position:0%
carved out for that but its lack of
 
04:33:48.070 --> 04:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
specificity on hazardous elements uh and
 
04:33:50.349 --> 04:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
handling uh what would that mean because
 
04:33:52.629 --> 04:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hazardous elements I assume
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean literally the periodic
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
table of elements um so would a
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
hazardous element be a
 
04:34:03.750 --> 04:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
virus you know like it I just feel like
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
the carve out for has elements there
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
just needs more specificity in general
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
but uh in general I just yeah and to
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
close I just can't believe we're still
 
04:34:16.869 --> 04:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
having this uh conversation about the
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and like use cases of
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
masks um and then it's just entirely
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
brought to this like point of view of
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
that it's a issue of freedom and
 
04:34:35.070 --> 04:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
without uh taking to account uh Public
 
04:34:39.070 --> 04:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
Health is uh you know I I I just the
 
04:34:42.109 --> 04:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's completely missing the point of
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
masks I'd say but I love any questions
 
04:34:48.070 --> 04:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
um that's all I have thank you very much
 
04:34:49.230 --> 04:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there any
 
04:34:50.910 --> 04:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
represent Terry thank you so you covered
 
04:34:54.990 --> 04:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of ground but I'd like to return
 
04:34:57.510 --> 04:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
for a moment to the disagreement that
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
you have apparently have with Dr Harvey
 
04:35:04.269 --> 04:35:04.279 align:start position:0%
R uh with respect to the he was the he
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
was the uh the academic uh who made the
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
state the epidemiologist who made the
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
statement with respect to the fence and
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the mosquitoes I'm just wondering if you
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
have uh Avail yourself of the
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be in conversation with
 
04:35:19.470 --> 04:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
him and an attempt to try to determine
 
04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
whether you you and he can find some
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
common ground are you I'm sorry I'm not
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
quite understanding your question sir um
 
04:35:27.869 --> 04:35:27.879 align:start position:0%
are you you appear to be disagreeing
 
04:35:29.869 --> 04:35:29.879 align:start position:0%
with Dr Harvey rich and I'm not sure if
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
I am but I'm not familiar enough with
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
his spec his specific statements to know
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
if I'm disagreeing with him or not but
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
you cited his statement and said you
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
disag I know and I'm trying to get to
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
your point sir um so are you suggesting
 
04:35:45.869 --> 04:35:45.879 align:start position:0%
that he's not saying that the chain link
 
04:35:47.310 --> 04:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
fence only applies to the actual
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
particulate size are you saying he in uh
 
04:35:53.551 --> 04:35:53.561 align:start position:0%
that he is acknowledging that okay that
 
04:35:56.629 --> 04:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
the viruses that are contained within
 
04:35:59.189 --> 04:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
water droplet material that that
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pass through his chain link
 
04:36:03.310 --> 04:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
fence actually only saying about the
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
actual virus itself well actually I'm
 
04:36:07.551 --> 04:36:07.561 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you if you've had that
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
conversation with him not with me I'm
 
04:36:11.709 --> 04:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
not Dr Harvey Rich I just asked I have
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
to have you or not I'm asking you is
 
04:36:16.510 --> 04:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
what his statement is because I I don't
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
have his statement in front of me right
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
now um so I'm not sure okay so you
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with him but you've I'm saying
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know what his statement exactly
 
04:36:27.390 --> 04:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
is so I'm not sure thank you thank
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and I I wanted
 
04:36:38.109 --> 04:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
to turn to uh the testimony cuz it it it
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
was surprising to me a little bit when
 
04:36:43.629 --> 04:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
you said that covid um is transmitted on
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
droplets of water within droplets water
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
within droplets of water which so I have
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
a background in healthcare I was a
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
paramedic for quite a while and we have
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
different precautions that we take
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
depending on whether something is
 
04:36:59.470 --> 04:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
Airborne or droplet born so are still as
 
04:37:03.310 --> 04:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
far as I'm aware aerosolized uh
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
virus particles I'm sorry I'm not sure
 
04:37:07.869 --> 04:37:07.879 align:start position:0%
the correct terminology there um as far
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware even the aerosolized
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
version are still within a water droplet
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the virus free
 
04:37:17.109 --> 04:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
floating thank you further questions
 
04:37:19.070 --> 04:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
question I may have missed your
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
introduction but do you have a medical
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
background or a science background or
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
anything nope so this is just your
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
personal opinion thank you yes it is um
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
I would add that a few months prior to
 
04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic uh was for my job uh using
 
04:37:41.629 --> 04:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
a Crosscut saw while wearing m95 mask um
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
for hours um so as as far as any I think
 
04:37:46.709 --> 04:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
I heard one of the representatives
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
mention um mask fatigue something I I
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
there wasn't much explanation attached
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
to that but um I just I would throw that
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
in for uh just a personal anecdote of
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
that it's quite possible to wear
 
04:38:08.109 --> 04:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
a highle mask and still do physical
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
activity represent dry thank you Mr
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
04:38:15.429 --> 04:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
abut so I'm playing clerk today and you
 
04:38:16.869 --> 04:38:16.879 align:start position:0%
didn't check whether you support or
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill no I did not didn't I
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't check it
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
ohos but wondering if the the things you
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
brought up if you addressed those would
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
that make it more amenable to you um I
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
would have to see how it's addressed but
 
04:38:38.830 --> 04:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
I think uh more generally speaking um an
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
outright ban on on mask policies I think
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
is probably a step too far still but
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
with the bill as written I have specific
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
concerns to those uh those issues of
 
04:38:55.230 --> 04:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
vagueness thank you are there further
 
04:38:57.349 --> 04:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
04:38:59.830 --> 04:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh Kitty
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.840 --> 04:39:09.390 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:39:09.390 --> 04:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you good afternoon my name
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
is Kitty motti I'm from der New
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and i would support this bill
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
um as an educator during the pandemic
 
04:39:21.949 --> 04:39:21.959 align:start position:0%
teaching children to read was very
 
04:39:24.670 --> 04:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
difficult I worked at an outdoor school
 
04:39:26.670 --> 04:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
and even though we
 
04:39:29.629 --> 04:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
had gone through a lot of steps to
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of our children we
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
were still as teachers wearing a mask
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
and our little kiddos were around
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
delightful little campfires and it
 
04:39:40.110 --> 04:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
looked very romantic I'm sure from the
 
04:39:42.628 --> 04:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
outside but attempting to teach
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
different pronunciations of words was
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult and um even though we
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
tried to stay in person and we did as
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
much as we possibly could to influence
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
education in a positive way many of our
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
kiddos still fell
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
behind secondly I think this is a really
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
exciting bill because very rarely do we
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to protect the
 
04:40:06.910 --> 04:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
kiddos who are here it frustrates me to
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
no end that children are not usually in
 
04:40:12.590 --> 04:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
the rooms where laws are being made to
 
04:40:15.270 --> 04:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
decide what their behavior will or will
 
04:40:18.350 --> 04:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
not have to be there are some here today
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
and I'm really grateful that they have
 
04:40:24.750 --> 04:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
come and I think this is a wonderful
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all of you who have been
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
elected by their parents to show them
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
that they matter to you that their
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
decision making that their freedoms
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
matter to you that you believe as their
 
04:40:42.510 --> 04:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
elected officials who represent them
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
even though they cannot vote for you you
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
have an incredible chance to show them
 
04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
hey you know what we do trust in your
 
04:40:53.230 --> 04:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
parents ability to make this call we do
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
want to protect the freedoms that you
 
04:40:57.830 --> 04:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
guys are going to have to fight for
 
04:41:01.150 --> 04:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
later on and this bill would enable you
 
04:41:03.990 --> 04:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
them to know that for you guys to say
 
04:41:06.110 --> 04:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know what we're not going to make
 
04:41:08.948 --> 04:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
this demand from on high we're going to
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
let you all decide for yourselves a few
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
years ago one of my favorite bills came
 
04:41:15.910 --> 04:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire State
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
Legislature and it was a reactive Bill
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
to something ridiculous that happened I
 
04:41:22.830 --> 04:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
think in Pennsylvania where a 9-year-old
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
girl's hus not husband excuse me father
 
04:41:28.670 --> 04:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
had been arrested because she was trying
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
to have a lemonade stand and a police
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
officer came by and said hey you don't
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
have a permit for this and the dad
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
naturally was
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
upset the dad ended up getting arrested
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire came forward and said
 
04:41:44.830 --> 04:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want that to happen here we're
 
04:41:46.628 --> 04:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
going to make sure that little
 
04:41:47.910 --> 04:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs can be little
 
04:41:49.910 --> 04:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs and we passed a bill that
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
protected a kid's right to have a
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
lemonade stand I would like to see that
 
04:41:58.270 --> 04:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
happen again thank you thank you very

Osborne welcome back thank you good
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is aan Osborne I'm a
 
04:42:30.750 --> 04:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
17-year-old student from Auburn New
 
04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for at least two solid years
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
during the corona virus outbreak New
 
04:42:37.948 --> 04:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens everywhere were
 
04:42:40.190 --> 04:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
subjected to the tyranny of mask
 
04:42:42.788 --> 04:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
mandates I remember all too well how
 
04:42:44.310 --> 04:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
young children could not even attend
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
school without being forced to cover
 
04:42:48.830 --> 04:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
their faces we were told these mandates
 
04:42:50.910 --> 04:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
were for our own safety that we were
 
04:42:53.310 --> 04:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
protecting our fellows by complying with
 
04:42:56.510 --> 04:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
these Statewide demands it wasn't about
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
safety it was about control if the state
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
is per permitted to raise its children
 
04:43:04.628 --> 04:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
in this way to groom them to comply with
 
04:43:06.670 --> 04:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
anything they say even something as
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
simple as covering their faces what kind
 
04:43:12.270 --> 04:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
of society does that create certainly
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
not one of logical independent thinkers
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
no it creates a hive mind a society of
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
complacent subservient sheep the era of
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
mask mandates must never again be
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to resurface young children
 
04:43:28.948 --> 04:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
should never again be raised in an
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
environment where they are punished
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
simply for the decision to or not to
 
04:43:34.990 --> 04:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
wear a face covering parents shouldn't
 
04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
even be allowed to force a mask on their
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
child it's essentially child abuse and
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
if parents shouldn't be able to do that
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
other should the state thank you thank
 
04:43:46.868 --> 04:43:46.878 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
Phillips good afternoon everyone thank

you um I am representative Emily
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
Phillips uh representing Fremont New
 
04:44:07.510 --> 04:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire inham district 7 so um I'm
 
04:44:08.788 --> 04:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
thrilled to be here because it's the
 
04:44:10.830 --> 04:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
reason why I ran for office honestly uh
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
I was on the school board in Fremont uh
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
in 2019 and I got this whammer whammy of
 
04:44:19.190 --> 04:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
a a covid pandemic to unroll during my
 
04:44:21.350 --> 04:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
first time as Schoolboard member and my
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
district was a little unique we uh
 
04:44:26.470 --> 04:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
adopted a facal coverings policy before
 
04:44:28.750 --> 04:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
we opened in the fall in a compared to
 
04:44:30.430 --> 04:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
other districts around us a lot of
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
people were going either uh virtual or a
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
um you know half the kids some days half
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
kids others so we actually opened in
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
person we were a k through eight um
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
district and we were able to pass a uh
 
04:44:45.948 --> 04:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
policy called facial covering so um
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
parents had the option of using cloth
 
04:44:50.110 --> 04:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
face masks disposable masks or plastic
 
04:44:53.350 --> 04:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
face Shields um I for my own children I
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
have three children now but at the time
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
I had two um two of my children are
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
severely uh disabled special ed and so I
 
04:45:02.230 --> 04:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
wrote uh to the principal and saying my
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
children will be wearing plastic face
 
04:45:06.030 --> 04:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
Shields and it um the reason I gave um
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
not that I was required to but I gave
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
reasons based on their IEP goals that
 
04:45:11.788 --> 04:45:11.798 align:start position:0%
were extensive that would be unable to
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
be met if their faces were covered um a
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
lot of it was speech and language
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
related so um my children went to school
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm thankful for that in the fall of
 
04:45:23.708 --> 04:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
2020 um I had actually tried during the
 
04:45:26.270 --> 04:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
summer to get my then kindergartener and
 
04:45:29.470 --> 04:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
first grader to wear masks and they were
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
not able to do so obviously and they
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
were you know expressing discomfort they
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
weren't they were barely talking as it
 
04:45:38.550 --> 04:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
is without the mask but um so we wor
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
plastic face Shields to school um in
 
04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
November of 20120 we were on vacation um
 
04:45:45.350 --> 04:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
and again I'm on the school board at
 
04:45:46.510 --> 04:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
this time and I get a call from my
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
superintendent while I'm in Florida and
 
04:45:50.430 --> 04:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
I said hey um the governor just issued a
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
math mandate so your kids can't come
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
back to school after vacation and I said
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
what you can't you can't say that and my
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent was like yeah you can't
 
04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
and then she had not read the full order
 
04:46:02.110 --> 04:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
and realized that it did not apply to K
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
through 12 schools so she later the day
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
after calling the Department of
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
Education riged on that and said your
 
04:46:09.150 --> 04:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
kids can come back with their plastic
 
04:46:11.070 --> 04:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
face shield so that was the first time
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
that was just um Insanity um my daughter
 
04:46:17.150 --> 04:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh we repeated her in kindergarten after
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
doing her first year in kindergarten
 
04:46:21.628 --> 04:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
with the whole Mass policy going on um
 
04:46:23.310 --> 04:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
she formed no connections with other
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
students she was completely non-verbal
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
at school um she was not speaking I
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
think primarily because she could not
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
see the mouth and lip shape shapes of
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
like her SLP providers her classmates
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
she just did not speak um there's
 
04:46:42.750 --> 04:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
something called a like a sound wall you
 
04:46:44.430 --> 04:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
could put up of images of how to make
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
the the you know the sound s or the
 
04:46:47.868 --> 04:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
sound p with your mouth so she was not
 
04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
seeing that from her peers she was
 
04:46:51.548 --> 04:46:51.558 align:start position:0%
wearing a plastic face shield Her speech
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
and language providers were not wearing
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the clear masks that were coming out
 
04:46:58.910 --> 04:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know for being pushed they were
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
still distancing themselves and trying
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
to teach my child how to talk without
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
showing their face so it's a little
 
04:47:03.680 --> 04:47:04.628 align:start position:0%
showing their face so it's a little
frustrating

04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
frustrating
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
um masks became optional in the fall of
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
2021 in my district so um some kids wore
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
them some kids didn't um there was a
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
high viral load in our area where all of
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
a sudden in October my school board
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
decided we're going to make it or it
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't even a school board I think it
 
04:47:22.670 --> 04:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
was a superintendent who decided
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
randomly we're going to implement mass
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
for the next two weeks so I pulled my
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
daughter out because she was already
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
like just burnt out I was like she
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
cannot be around kids with the mask on
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
she was not talking to anyone she was
 
04:47:33.788 --> 04:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
making no progress it was it was almost
 
04:47:33.798 --> 04:47:34.910 align:start position:0%
making no progress it was it was almost
like

04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
um she would just go to school do
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
nothing come home and then be just
 
04:47:40.510 --> 04:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
mentally unraveling because she was it
 
04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
was like so just crazy to be around
 
04:47:45.548 --> 04:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
everyone with their faces covered um I
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
had to put her back into school because
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
I just couldn't manage everything and um
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
homeschool her for two weeks so I ended
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
up putting her back in um the following
 
04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
year they uh the school approached me
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
saying they they thought she had
 
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
selective mutism um because she wasn't
 
04:48:01.750 --> 04:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
speaking at school I knew her outside of
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
school and she could talk but she wasn't
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
getting any of her Services um selective
 
04:48:08.590 --> 04:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
mutism is an anxiety disorder that is uh
 
04:48:13.070 --> 04:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
resolved via uh medication um and um so
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
I wasn't really interested in that I I
 
04:48:16.670 --> 04:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
want to skip to my son for a second but
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh my son at the same time was in second
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
grade during 2020 and he wore a plastic
 
04:48:25.470 --> 04:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
face shield uh he he may have been the
 
04:48:27.310 --> 04:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
only kid in his class wearing one he was
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
asked a partner with another student in
 
04:48:31.350 --> 04:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
his classroom that the child raised his
 
04:48:33.390 --> 04:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
hand and said miss teacher I don't want
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
to work with Colin because he doesn't
 
04:48:38.110 --> 04:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
wear a face mask so the teachers used
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
that moment and said okay I'm going to
 
04:48:41.708 --> 04:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
sign sign you to someone else Colin
 
04:48:43.150 --> 04:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
instead of using that moment to say
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
Colin is clean Colin is safe everyone is
 
04:48:47.830 --> 04:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
safe here you can work together she did
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
not use that moment correctly I did not
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
find this out from my son I found it out
 
04:48:53.548 --> 04:48:53.558 align:start position:0%
from another parent of a a classmate and
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
my son was very upset when I brought it
 
04:48:56.708 --> 04:48:56.718 align:start position:0%
up cuz he knew i' would be mad so that's
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
why he didn't tell me um so in um
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
invisible disabilities become very
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
visible when you have these face masks
 
04:49:04.350 --> 04:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
there are kids who can't wear them so I
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
was wearing a PL my child was wearing a
 
04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
plastic face shield so he has he looked
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
different but there there are children
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
who really can't wear this adults can't
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
wear these masks so when you implement
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
these mandates it's just it's it's so
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
divisive I can't even explain it um so
 
04:49:19.310 --> 04:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm very shook up as a parent who went
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
through this but
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
um I pulled both my children out in 2022
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
like I said they were trying to medicate
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
my daughter or diagnose her with a
 
04:49:28.590 --> 04:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
condition that's only solv through
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
medication uh for anxiety so I I
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
homeschooled last year and I had to work
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
and I had to be a State Rep so I put
 
04:49:36.548 --> 04:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
them in a co-op four days a week I paid
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
$950 a month for my kids to go somewhere
 
04:49:41.070 --> 04:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
else during the day so I could come here
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
or I could go to my job I ran out of
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
money so they're back in public charter
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
school and I love the charter school and
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
we're in a different time now right and
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
so there are no kids wearing masks and
 
04:49:50.510 --> 04:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're not being told to cover their
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
mouths and I appreciate that but I'm
 
04:49:53.430 --> 04:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent it from happening
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
again because people on school boards
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
are not qualified to make this decision
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
um my daughter is speaking and she is
 
04:50:02.350 --> 04:50:02.360 align:start position:0%
reading and both my kids were retained
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
because I knew better than to send them
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
back two years delayed um they are
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
thriving in their public charter school
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm thrilled for that and she does
 
04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
not have an anxiety disorder she is
 
04:50:12.548 --> 04:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
happy and she's connecting with people
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
when we talk about local Authority and I
 
04:50:16.190 --> 04:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
think that's why the bill was vetoed
 
04:50:18.310 --> 04:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
there is nothing more local than a
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
family and an individual Choice okay and
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
that's what I want to happen we do not
 
04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
override parental Choice Family Choice
 
04:50:28.270 --> 04:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
individual choice so again we're talking
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
about kids with mask mandates not adults
 
04:50:31.470 --> 04:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to hear the argument
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
that I can wear a mask all day and I'm
 
04:50:35.070 --> 04:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
fine because kids are not the same every
 
04:50:36.990 --> 04:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
kid is individual happy to take
 
04:50:39.430 --> 04:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you very much
 
04:50:41.910 --> 04:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions you have to be pretty
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated to spend 900 plus bucks to
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
receive a salary that's $100 yeah that
 
04:50:50.070 --> 04:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
was just I was trying to save my kids it
 
04:50:51.470 --> 04:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
was a mental health year for us and we
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
loved homeschooling it was great it's
 
04:50:54.270 --> 04:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
just I not everyone can do it with you
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
know if I'm not home I can't educate
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
them so I had to send them somewhere
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
it's just a expensive thanks thank you
 
04:50:59.638 --> 04:51:01.230 align:start position:0%
it's just a expensive thanks thank you
you're

04:51:01.230 --> 04:51:01.240 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:51:01.240 --> 04:51:02.750 align:start position:0%
you're
welcome

04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh see Barrett Christina and then we
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
have one other card after that on this
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
one oh another
 
04:51:12.600 --> 04:51:25.310 align:start position:0%
one oh another
one

04:51:25.310 --> 04:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:27.430 --> 04:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chairman lad good
 
04:51:29.628 --> 04:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee bar
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
Christina from the School Board
 
04:51:32.548 --> 04:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
Association I suppose somebody has to be
 
04:51:34.590 --> 04:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
the contrarian on this Bill and it
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
usually falls on me so here we are um we
 
04:51:40.110 --> 04:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
are opposed to the bill um two quick
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
notes um first um though she's no longer
 
04:51:44.230 --> 04:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
on the school board I would like to um
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank representative Phillips for her
 
04:51:47.470 --> 04:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
prior work on her local school board and
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
also one of the last things that she
 
04:51:51.750 --> 04:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
said I think is is important to um take
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
into consideration when we go back to
 
04:51:56.590 --> 04:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
March of 2020 representative Philip said
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
that school boards are not qualified to
 
04:52:00.868 --> 04:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
make these decisions nhba could not
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
agree more which is why I think this
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
bill perhaps maybe a little misguided in
 
04:52:09.548 --> 04:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
terms of directing um the it's not a
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
mandate I guess a Prohibition towards
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
local school boards when local school
 
04:52:16.708 --> 04:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
boards adopted or implemented masking
 
04:52:18.788 --> 04:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
policies after we returned to school I
 
04:52:20.548 --> 04:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
guess it was fall of
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
20021 those were under executive order
 
04:52:26.230 --> 04:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
from from the governor um I think I have
 
04:52:31.510 --> 04:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
it here um this is executive order I'm
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
sorry set 74 um this may be the older
 
04:52:37.350 --> 04:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
one but it's you know it it's in order
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
requiring persons to wear masks or cloth
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
face coverings when in public spaces
 
04:52:44.670 --> 04:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
without physical or social distancing
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
that was an executive order from the
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office that was not a
 
04:52:51.390 --> 04:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
decision of a local school board um you
 
04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
know in in New Hampshire um also June
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
2021 New Hampshire health and education
 
04:53:01.628 --> 04:53:01.638 align:start position:0%

04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
here's a picture of the governor
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education and uh Dr Chan
 
04:53:10.150 --> 04:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
it says while K12 school this is the
 
04:53:11.628 --> 04:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
guidance the school board school boards
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
across the state we're getting while K12
 
04:53:16.670 --> 04:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
schools continue to have the ability to
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
set face mask policies for covid-19
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%

Health Services recommend that there
 
04:53:26.310 --> 04:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
should be flexibility in school fath
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
mask policies so that if situations
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
arise where it becomes potentially
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
unsafe to wear a face mask for a
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
prolonged period of time that steps be
 
04:53:36.708 --> 04:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
taken to allow Mass to come off even in
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
indoor environments the the New
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire division of Public Health is
 
04:53:43.270 --> 04:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
in the process of updating their General
 
04:53:44.788 --> 04:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
face mask guidance so we have a
 
04:53:46.830 --> 04:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
statement that's saying well we're not
 
04:53:48.350 --> 04:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
sure what we want you to do and we'll
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
get back to you meanwhile schools are
 
04:53:52.030 --> 04:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
still trying to do what they're trying
 
04:53:53.470 --> 04:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
to do and school boards are trying to
 
04:53:55.548 --> 04:53:55.558 align:start position:0%
spend hours and hours and hours
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
developing plans listening to the CDC
 
04:54:00.430 --> 04:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
listening to the what the state
 
04:54:02.350 --> 04:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist listening to the governor
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
listening to the Department of educ
 
04:54:07.788 --> 04:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
education so further on I think I've got
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
the the I believe it was representative
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
Phillips also mentioned this is May of
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
2023 to new new sites need to protect
 
04:54:17.708 --> 04:54:17.718 align:start position:0%
local control in veto of of of Bill
 
04:54:20.430 --> 04:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
Banning Mass decisions so I just wanted
 
04:54:23.230 --> 04:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
to be clear that it local school boards
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
were developing their protocols and
 
04:54:28.470 --> 04:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
policies relative to masking inperson or
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
remote social distancing School busing
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
based on the guidance that the
 
04:54:36.750 --> 04:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
professionals were telling us it wasn't
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
just Joe Schoolboard member a particular
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard in a in a member in a
 
04:54:42.510 --> 04:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
community that thought a mask was a
 
04:54:45.110 --> 04:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
great idea nobody wanted to wear a mask
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
we understood that you know the
 
04:54:48.948 --> 04:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
challenges that it was having kids
 
04:54:52.628 --> 04:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
little kids 5 6 7 years old all day long
 
04:54:54.750 --> 04:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
trying to wear a mask that was the
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
guidance that we were given so um you
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
know I I I I could go on and on there
 
04:55:03.868 --> 04:55:03.878 align:start position:0%
are a handful of Court decisions in from
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um you know masking was
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
being called child restraint under RSU
 
04:55:15.788 --> 04:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
RSA 126 D and I think it's you know
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
important to note that if this is the
 
04:55:21.030 --> 04:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
hollbrook line
 
04:55:24.868 --> 04:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
case when since simply put RSC chapter
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
126 you has no bearing on the legality
 
04:55:29.070 --> 04:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
of the school district's Mass mandates
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's argument to the contrary
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
is based on a twisted and tortured
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
reading of the statute
 
04:55:36.030 --> 04:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
this is very important it is an affront
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
to children who have actually been
 
04:55:39.628 --> 04:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
subject to unnecessary and dangerous
 
04:55:41.430 --> 04:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
physical restraints while at school
 
04:55:42.510 --> 04:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
because that was the argument that was
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
being made three years ago um anyway you
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
know the other thing too is no we don't
 
04:55:50.910 --> 04:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
have mask mandates I don't know of any
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
school district that has a mask mandate
 
04:55:54.708 --> 04:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
anymore you know we're addressing
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
something you know
 
04:55:58.390 --> 04:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
retrospectively that hasn't been in
 
04:56:00.788 --> 04:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
place in the state in in in in in two
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
plus years um so I just you know if if
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
if an amendment needs to be brought
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
forth that the governor cannot issue an
 
04:56:10.830 --> 04:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
executive order mandating masks and that
 
04:56:12.430 --> 04:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
Services or whoever it is can't put out
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
guidance recommending people wear masks
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
nhba would have no objection to that
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
because that's not within our purview
 
04:56:21.510 --> 04:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
but you know it was not local school
 
04:56:22.708 --> 04:56:22.718 align:start position:0%
districts and it was not local school
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
boards that were making these decisions
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
we were listening to the commissioner
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
the governor CDC and Dr Chan in trying
 
04:56:32.510 --> 04:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
to make our decisions and trying to
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
identify the needs for you know whatever
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
160,000 kids in the state 20,000
 
04:56:40.390 --> 04:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
teachers Paris professional support
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
staff and so on and so forth so with
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm happy to answer any
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions from
 
04:56:48.788 --> 04:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
the committee representa
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question this particular bill
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
is set to go into section
 
04:57:01.390 --> 04:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
18910 um and as I look at it that 18910
 
04:57:03.750 --> 04:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
is it's it's a new paragraph obviously
 
04:57:06.990 --> 04:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
but it's under studies so it's like with
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
financial literacy and with uh teaching
 
04:57:13.948 --> 04:57:13.958 align:start position:0%
health education and physical education
 
04:57:13.958 --> 04:57:17.230 align:start position:0%
health education and physical education
and

04:57:17.230 --> 04:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't seem like it it fits
 
04:57:21.390 --> 04:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
there and I'm just wondering if there's
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
another part that you might know of law
 
04:57:27.590 --> 04:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
where Public Health
 
04:57:30.510 --> 04:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
um is listed What what schools can and
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
cannot do for example when I was
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
teaching there was was a group of uh
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
exchange students that went to Soviet
 
04:57:40.548 --> 04:57:40.558 align:start position:0%
Union and uh was exposed to measles and
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
when they got back uh several of the it
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
was April vacation several of them came
 
04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
down with measles and so at that point
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
there was a public health um recommend
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
not a recommendation actually a demand
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
that if a student was in school at the
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
time and not vaccinated for measles they
 
04:57:59.628 --> 04:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
had to stay home for a certain length of
 
04:58:02.910 --> 04:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
time right um and I remember that cuz I
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
had a couple athletes on my tennis team
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
that had to stay home and couldn't play
 
04:58:10.150 --> 04:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just wondering if that's uh
 
04:58:12.150 --> 04:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
in another section of law under public
 
04:58:14.548 --> 04:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
health or uh with school law sure thank
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much represent for
 
04:58:18.070 --> 04:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
the question RSA 200 is health and
 
04:58:19.628 --> 04:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
sanitation which relates to school
 
04:58:22.670 --> 04:58:22.680 align:start position:0%

04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%

04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
defects of uh uh or students with
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities um RSA 200 col 40 is
 
04:58:46.910 --> 04:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
emergency care so um there's also it's
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
not be um let not uh loose sight of RSA
 
04:58:52.830 --> 04:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
194 col 3 that puts a direct obligation
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
of school districts to um um protect
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
children relative to health and safety
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
standards as well too which is often
 
04:59:02.548 --> 04:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
cited in a number of the lawsuits um 3
 
04:59:04.510 --> 04:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
four years go relative to masking that
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
the district has an affirmative
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect the health and
 
04:59:08.830 --> 04:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
safety of
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
students follow up just follow up so
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't in the appropriate section of
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh I mean aside from nhs's objections to
 
04:59:19.110 --> 04:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
the bill I mean I it may perhaps be best
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
put in RSA 200 thank you other other
 
04:59:25.070 --> 04:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
leus Could you um tell me that 190
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
whatever one that you that last one that
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
you quoted 190 I'm not sure 189 col oh
 
04:59:38.910 --> 04:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what you're talking about
 
04:59:40.788 --> 04:59:40.798 align:start position:0%
represent last one that you did I just
 
04:59:42.190 --> 04:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to write the number down oh oh
 
04:59:45.230 --> 04:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry R say 200 colon 40 Emergency
 
04:59:48.030 --> 04:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
Care was that the one no there was one
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
um about protecting children oh I'm
 
04:59:55.548 --> 04:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
sorry I say 194 colon 3 194 colon 3 yeah
 
04:59:57.990 --> 04:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
and three thank you you're welcome I
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
think I have that right if not I you
 
05:00:01.470 --> 05:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
know Becky and I can follow up with you
 
05:00:02.708 --> 05:00:02.718 align:start position:0%
with a correct citation but I'm pretty
 
05:00:05.150 --> 05:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
sure that's it without pulling up in Fr
 
05:00:06.628 --> 05:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for being for taking my
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
question and for speaking to
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
this would you agree would you confirm
 
05:00:19.230 --> 05:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
that knowledge of masking is different
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
today than it was in 2020 and 2021 yeah
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative I
 
05:00:26.948 --> 05:00:26.958 align:start position:0%
mean I mean
 
05:00:30.430 --> 05:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
certainly just thinking back to the
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
experience that nsba was going through
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
and and the phone calls that nhba was
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
getting from school boards and and
 
05:00:39.708 --> 05:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
school administrators and working in
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
conjunction very closely with the
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Education commissioner and
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
I were on the phone together probably
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
every day for a number of months at that
 
05:00:50.670 --> 05:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
time you know it it it you know it was
 
05:00:53.030 --> 05:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
chaos school districts were were doing
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
the best that they could possibly do it
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
was very interesting I I remember I
 
05:00:58.990 --> 05:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
recall this I think Becky and I miss
 
05:01:00.670 --> 05:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
Wilson and I were having a conversation
 
05:01:03.628 --> 05:01:03.638 align:start position:0%
recently that when everything shut down
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
in March 15th or whatever it was of
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
2020 um I was getting more phone calls
 
05:01:14.190 --> 05:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
from superintendent between say 400 p.m.
 
05:01:16.150 --> 05:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
and 900 p.m. because I think during the
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
day they were dealing with what can they
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
do in our building and we got to find
 
05:01:22.990 --> 05:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
the masking and and the and and another
 
05:01:25.548 --> 05:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
Point too just got me going on it is
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
you've seen me often do in this in this
 
05:01:29.230 --> 05:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
room we're talking about masks here what
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
about plexiglass and cleaning supplies
 
05:01:33.708 --> 05:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
and all the other PPE that and masking
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
and gowns and and whatnot are we going
 
05:01:37.470 --> 05:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
to are we going to prohibit those moving
 
05:01:39.430 --> 05:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
forward I don't I don't know but you
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
know it wasn't just masking that was
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:01:44.948 --> 05:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
the the the mitigation efforts if you
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
will so I mean yeah we certainly we
 
05:01:49.350 --> 05:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
certainly know now I'm not not a medical
 
05:01:50.548 --> 05:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
expert I've said this I'm not an
 
05:01:52.590 --> 05:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
educator I'm here to help the school
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
boards and the administrators navigate
 
05:01:55.548 --> 05:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they have to
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
navigate so hope that answers your
 
05:01:57.840 --> 05:01:59.990 align:start position:0%
navigate so hope that answers your
question

05:01:59.990 --> 05:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:02:02.350 --> 05:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
oh that does answer my question and I
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
would further
 
05:02:07.430 --> 05:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
ask would you confirm that there was
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
never any intention to do harm to
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
children that it was an intent to the
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
state of the incomplete knowledge of the
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
time to protect children thank you very
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
much um we've talked about in local
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
parenes the school boards and school
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
districts have an affirmative obligation
 
05:02:24.990 --> 05:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
to protect kids and keep kids safe when
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
they're under custody and control during
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
the school day and school districts and
 
05:02:32.030 --> 05:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
school board members and superintendents
 
05:02:33.510 --> 05:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
and I believe that department and health
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
and human services and whatever public
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
agencies were all doing their best to to
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
keep everybody safe especially
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
kids thank you further
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you oh
 
05:02:46.080 --> 05:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you oh
represent

05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:02:50.110 --> 05:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
Belcher well thank you Mr chair uh I
 
05:02:52.470 --> 05:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify one item because
 
05:02:54.150 --> 05:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
I know that these there were guidance
 
05:02:55.548 --> 05:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
and whatnot was coming down from the
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
state level Dr Chan the governor and
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
others um but I I'm not entirely sure on
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
how this was dealt with as as a local
 
05:03:06.030 --> 05:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
level um was it your testimony that the
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
school boards did not adopt policies
 
05:03:11.788 --> 05:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
regarding mass or it was all coming down
 
05:03:13.310 --> 05:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
from above on them yeah thank you very
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
much for the question um if I did say
 
05:03:17.190 --> 05:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
that they did not adopt policies that
 
05:03:19.548 --> 05:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
was probably an error some school boards
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
probably did affirmatively adopt a
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
policy um but that policy was certainly
 
05:03:27.070 --> 05:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
based on the guidance um that they were
 
05:03:29.310 --> 05:03:29.320 align:start position:0%
getting from the medical experts and
 
05:03:30.948 --> 05:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
whatnot so if I did say that they did
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
not that was that was an error
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you very much
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative are there any further
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
05:03:41.548 --> 05:03:41.558 align:start position:0%
very much uh
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
Leah she
 
05:03:44.240 --> 05:03:48.430 align:start position:0%
Leah she
here

05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:52.548 --> 05:03:52.558 align:start position:0%
yeah hi I'm Leo Walo I'm from Manchester
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
I was a teacher in one of the City
 
05:03:56.548 --> 05:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
Middle Schools when we went through the
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the year the full year
 
05:04:02.430 --> 05:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
after that um so I'm not going to speak
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
to the science I'm just going to speak
 
05:04:06.990 --> 05:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
to what I saw happen and the effect that
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
that the masks and other things it is
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
hard to tease things out but to the
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
extent that I'm able to tease out the
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
masks in particular I'll do that with
 
05:04:18.030 --> 05:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
these three or four anecdotes the first
 
05:04:20.548 --> 05:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
is of a little girl that was very sweet
 
05:04:23.708 --> 05:04:23.718 align:start position:0%
tried very hard always came to school so
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
she was one of them that came even when
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
we were only allowing certain days we we
 
05:04:31.990 --> 05:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
lost a third of our kids when we did
 
05:04:34.470 --> 05:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
that they never came at all but she came
 
05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
every day she was allowed to she sailed
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
into that pandemic not with the
 
05:04:41.990 --> 05:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
strongest Foundation she had a high
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
level of anxiety as her Baseline as so
 
05:04:47.510 --> 05:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
many of them do she wasn't unusual in
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
that she didn't do that well in school
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
and those two things are usually related
 
05:04:55.150 --> 05:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
but she tried hard and she came every
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
day when
 
05:05:01.750 --> 05:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
these steps were implemented I noticed
 
05:05:03.548 --> 05:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
that she started to disappear from her
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
science classroom she would get up and
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
walk out or she wouldn't be there at all
 
05:05:09.510 --> 05:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
even though she had not been marked as
 
05:05:12.430 --> 05:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
absent for the day and one day I was
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
walking past her special ed room which
 
05:05:17.948 --> 05:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
was all in one little pod and she was in
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
there and so I stopped in and I talked
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
to her and and um the special ed
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
coordinator for our pod and I was like
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
hey sweetie what's going on I didn't see
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
you today and she was incapable of
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
speaking she was was literally paralyzed
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
with fear and her special ed teacher
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
told me and this is a quote that the
 
05:05:44.230 --> 05:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
masks frighten her to the extent that
 
05:05:45.868 --> 05:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
she cannot
 
05:05:48.470 --> 05:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
function and really if we stop to think
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
about that it might sound like hyperbole
 
05:05:54.070 --> 05:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
of a little 14-year-old girl but that is
 
05:05:56.990 --> 05:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
what they were for was because we were
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
in danger and so every face that she saw
 
05:06:03.510 --> 05:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
all day long telegraphed her her the
 
05:06:06.590 --> 05:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
message that she is in danger and she
 
05:06:08.948 --> 05:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't function I don't know what
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
became of her but I know she didn't
 
05:06:12.110 --> 05:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
finished the school year and I don't
 
05:06:14.030 --> 05:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
know how her high school went but I bet
 
05:06:15.750 --> 05:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
it was different than it would have been
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise the next story is a very
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
different one but these are archetypal
 
05:06:22.470 --> 05:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
stories there are many children that fit
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
into these broad categories this little
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
girl sailed into this storm with a good
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
foundation she was happy she was healthy
 
05:06:31.788 --> 05:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
she didn't seem to have any real
 
05:06:33.230 --> 05:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
problems she wasn't
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
coded and when we came to the end of
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
that long year and it was so hot that we
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
were sweltering and kids were ready to
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
pass out and the school district said
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done because
 
05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to faint and so they said
 
05:06:48.030 --> 05:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to wear the masks anymore
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
for the rest of this school year we were
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
nearing June by then or whatever and
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
we're on a little indoor field trip and
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'm heading upstairs to the uh to the
 
05:06:59.110 --> 05:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
library with the kids and I'm side by
 
05:07:00.628 --> 05:07:00.638 align:start position:0%
side with this one little girl that I
 
05:07:03.070 --> 05:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
was very close with she was always
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know talk to me freely and openly
 
05:07:08.150 --> 05:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
about anything and she had her mask on
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I asked her so does your um does
 
05:07:12.510 --> 05:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
your mom want you to wear your mask
 
05:07:14.110 --> 05:07:14.120 align:start position:0%
sweetie is she still really worried
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
about this and she said no my mother
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
gets very mad at me if I put this on and
 
05:07:23.230 --> 05:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
I said are you that scared of the virus
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
still that you feel you need to wear the
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
mask and she said no I've never been
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
afraid of this virus and I was stumped
 
05:07:32.670 --> 05:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
by that and I'm like then what is it why
 
05:07:34.590 --> 05:07:34.600 align:start position:0%
would you wear it it's sweltering and
 
05:07:37.030 --> 05:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
nobody says you have to and she said
 
05:07:39.788 --> 05:07:39.798 align:start position:0%
because I become invisible with this on
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
nobody calls on me in class I don't talk
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
to anybody in the hallways and she
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
became that kid with the hair in the
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
face and the hood pulled tight so you
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't see her face now we had rules
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
against that in school for a good reason
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
because that's not social emotional
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
learning to check out and to
 
05:08:02.590 --> 05:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
self-isolate like that she's in the but
 
05:08:04.948 --> 05:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
she might as well not be and she was a
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
good solid student before this happened
 
05:08:11.230 --> 05:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
the third story is completely different
 
05:08:13.470 --> 05:08:13.480 align:start position:0%
again I was upstairs and I was uh
 
05:08:15.990 --> 05:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
filling in for somebody who was out we
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
had to do a lot of covering I don't know
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
who the man was on the other side of the
 
05:08:22.548 --> 05:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
desk I mean on the other side of the
 
05:08:25.470 --> 05:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
wall that had a class I was up there
 
05:08:28.030 --> 05:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
substituting but I know that that
 
05:08:31.470 --> 05:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
teacher lost all control of himself and
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
was screaming in at some young boy
 
05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
because his mask was underneath his
 
05:08:39.030 --> 05:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
nose now I can't tell you if the kid had
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
done it out of defiance or if it had
 
05:08:43.830 --> 05:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing issue with that kid or
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
if he was just an unlucky boy whose mask
 
05:08:48.190 --> 05:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
slipped under his nose at the wrong time
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know but I know that if the boy
 
05:08:52.798 --> 05:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
I don't know but I know that if the boy
was

05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
defiant that didn't help teachers are in
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
a power differential in those classrooms
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
by design it can't be
 
05:09:05.788 --> 05:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
out but you have to be able to
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
deescalate a problem in a classroom and
 
05:09:12.190 --> 05:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
that teacher had been terrified to the
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
point that he could no longer really
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
serve his role he called that boy names
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
he said hateful rotten things I mean it
 
05:09:24.030 --> 05:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
was unbelievable and if it was only once
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
that I heard something like that I
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't bring it up as an anecdote
 
05:09:28.910 --> 05:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
because anybody can freak out or have a
 
05:09:32.788 --> 05:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
bad day but he was not alone I heard
 
05:09:35.070 --> 05:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
somebody earlier today said that these
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
things created divisions in these
 
05:09:42.390 --> 05:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
schools and they did they pitted people
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
against each
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
other the last person whose little
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotal story I'll tell you was my own
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
so the first year it was like really
 
05:09:54.230 --> 05:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
quick it was the end of the year it was
 
05:09:56.070 --> 05:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
really just a long summer you know
 
05:09:57.948 --> 05:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
summer break cuz nothing of any value
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
happened after we went remote that first
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
year nothing really of any value
 
05:10:03.510 --> 05:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
happened the second year either to tell
 
05:10:06.110 --> 05:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
you the truth but the second year was
 
05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
very different because it was all year
 
05:10:13.230 --> 05:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
and it was awful I had parents and I
 
05:10:16.628 --> 05:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
mean that plural multiple kids parents
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:34.670 --> 05:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
suicidal these masks were no small part
 
05:10:34.680 --> 05:10:36.230 align:start position:0%
suicidal these masks were no small part
of

05:10:36.230 --> 05:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
that it created a climate of
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
fear kids didn't come because they were
 
05:10:42.400 --> 05:10:44.150 align:start position:0%
fear kids didn't come because they were
so

05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:10:47.670 --> 05:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
scared I barely limped through that year
 
05:10:50.030 --> 05:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
I became a teacher as a second career I
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to be a teacher
 
05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
bad and I was good at it I really was
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I worked with kids that people
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
didn't want to work with because they
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
didn't like school and they were harder
 
05:11:04.548 --> 05:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
kids to work with and you know what they
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
clicked with me and they did things for
 
05:11:08.910 --> 05:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
me and they worked hard for me and in
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
London Dairy the word was
 
05:11:16.270 --> 05:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
miraculous and I barely survived that
 
05:11:19.230 --> 05:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
year and then in the
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
summer when that ridiculous triangle of
 
05:11:27.230 --> 05:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
fear was still being trotted out oh
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're in the green today but you never
 
05:11:32.910 --> 05:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
know and we could come to Yellow
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I literally had to go in and
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
sit across from that principal and
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
resign my position and told him that at
 
05:11:43.910 --> 05:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
this point I feel too
 
05:11:47.150 --> 05:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
guilty taking money to do this to
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
children ever
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
again now I had probably 10 years left
 
05:11:56.590 --> 05:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
in me before I would have retired and I
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
was a I had eight years of experience I
 
05:12:04.350 --> 05:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
could do my job it's a hard job and it's
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
getting harder every year and you need
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
to have a good number of years under
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
your belt before you're capable of doing
 
05:12:16.830 --> 05:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
it and I left a decade early so I don't
 
05:12:19.150 --> 05:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
know how many teachers we lost but I'll
 
05:12:22.430 --> 05:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
tell you I'll bet nine out of 10 of them
 
05:12:25.470 --> 05:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
only had two years left five years left
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
and they just took off early and you
 
05:12:30.548 --> 05:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
lost some of the most capable and
 
05:12:33.868 --> 05:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
competent teachers that you had in the
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
system we can never ever make snap
 
05:12:43.190 --> 05:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
decisions like this ever again we can
 
05:12:45.150 --> 05:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
worry about the science later we don't
 
05:12:47.070 --> 05:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
really even have to come to a agreement
 
05:12:49.708 --> 05:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
right now about whether those masks
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
saved one child's life I doubt
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
it but if we have some kind of Bubonic
 
05:13:03.628 --> 05:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
plague arise we can intelligently
 
05:13:03.638 --> 05:13:05.270 align:start position:0%
plague arise we can intelligently
slowly

05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
advisedly with the new um information
 
05:13:11.470 --> 05:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
that has become available to us not be
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
washed away in fear you know these
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
school boards they have no they have no
 
05:13:21.628 --> 05:13:21.638 align:start position:0%
they're always just trying to not be
 
05:13:25.110 --> 05:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
sued right they're trying to not be sued
 
05:13:28.230 --> 05:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to decide to do things
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that they think will save them from
 
05:13:31.628 --> 05:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
being sued yes we want to help the kids
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
yes yes we don't want to hurt them yes
 
05:13:34.868 --> 05:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
we want to teach them but that man that
 
05:13:37.190 --> 05:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
was here is not an educator that's not
 
05:13:39.070 --> 05:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
his role his role is to make sure how
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
the school board doesn't get sued how
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
can we get through our jobs and not get
 
05:13:47.030 --> 05:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
sued so why don't you do them all a
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
favor and put it in the law that they're
 
05:13:51.628 --> 05:13:51.638 align:start position:0%
never to do anything like that again and
 
05:13:54.470 --> 05:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
then they don't have to worry about
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
it do you have anything else no are
 
05:13:59.990 --> 05:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%

was an activist and I was here and I
 
05:14:36.190 --> 05:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
spoke in front of you chairman lad uh
 
05:14:39.670 --> 05:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
multiple times biting for this and when

just going to come here today and all I
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
was going to say is the reason why this
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill needs to be put into place is
 
05:14:58.030 --> 05:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
because we can never do this
 
05:15:00.910 --> 05:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
again no one no bureaucrat no school
 
05:15:03.868 --> 05:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
board no teacher none of it I have
 
05:15:06.548 --> 05:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
control over my children in the
 
05:15:10.510 --> 05:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
much but the gentleman here the lobbyist
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
that came up I want to be very clear
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
these were all
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
recommendations so let's talk about the
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
governor's mask mandate
 
05:15:31.110 --> 05:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
okay this order number five this order
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
shall not not apply to the following
 
05:15:36.868 --> 05:15:36.878 align:start position:0%
Educators students and staff within K
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
through 12 schools any person with a
 
05:15:41.590 --> 05:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
medical condition or disability that
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
prevents wearing a mask or other face
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
covering my daughter has anxiety she
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
could not get a mask exemption none of
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
this nobody was following the law they
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
did this on their own they did these
 
05:15:59.708 --> 05:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
mandates on their own they were all
 
05:16:01.788 --> 05:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations the governor never said
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
do this edel BL never said do that I'll
 
05:16:06.190 --> 05:16:06.200 align:start position:0%
give you every bit I mean I've got a
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
file that you can't even imagine that
 
05:16:10.670 --> 05:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
goes like a mile long I've got all of
 
05:16:14.430 --> 05:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
the documentation everything we just can
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
never do this again that's why this bill
 
05:16:18.868 --> 05:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
needs to go through if it's not in the
 
05:16:23.070 --> 05:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
right section I don't know 141 what HC
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is wherever it needs to
 
05:16:28.390 --> 05:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
go this has to happen we just need to

this just gives me uh just makes me
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
really upset I can't believe that we're
 
05:16:42.670 --> 05:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
still having these conversations if you
 
05:16:44.948 --> 05:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
want to wear a mask wear a mask that's
 
05:16:49.868 --> 05:16:49.878 align:start position:0%

12 we have just gone through the warmest
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
winter that has ever been recorded in
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we did not reach any
 
05:26:24.390 --> 05:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
Sub-Zero temps for the entire winter and
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
if this trend continues we also just saw
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
the coolest winter we will have going
 
05:26:29.600 --> 05:26:31.150 align:start position:0%
the coolest winter we will have going
forward

05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
why are cooler temperatures necessary
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
for our agriculture our Wildlife
 
05:26:38.190 --> 05:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
including things like
 
05:26:40.350 --> 05:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
ticks with a warmer climate we are
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
seeing we are going to see significant
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
changes in our environment our summers
 
05:26:48.030 --> 05:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
have become wetter and smokier due to
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
wildfires that are constantly burning
 
05:26:53.548 --> 05:26:53.558 align:start position:0%
around the United States crops are being
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
affected tourism is definitely being
 
05:26:58.310 --> 05:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
affected if there's no snow we have no
 
05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
skiers or
 
05:27:01.910 --> 05:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
snowmobilers if there's constant rainy
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
weather in the summer we're not going to
 
05:27:05.788 --> 05:27:05.798 align:start position:0%
see hikers or
 
05:27:08.990 --> 05:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
ATVs climate change is no joke we are
 
05:27:11.110 --> 05:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
seeing the impacts in our state on a
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
daily basis we've got floods we've got
 
05:27:15.750 --> 05:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
high tides we have no snow we have
 
05:27:18.910 --> 05:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
increased rain and we have temperature
 
05:27:20.670 --> 05:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
fluctuations the climate of New
 
05:27:22.270 --> 05:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is changing and if we don't
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
prepare for a different future we are
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
going to be lost climate change is also
 
05:27:30.190 --> 05:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
going to impact our students and their
 
05:27:32.510 --> 05:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
fames amilies it's going to impact all
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
of us this is our future we can no
 
05:27:37.390 --> 05:27:37.400 align:start position:0%
longer sit around and see what's going
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
to happen we need to be active we need
 
05:27:41.948 --> 05:27:41.958 align:start position:0%
to take significant steps to understand
 
05:27:44.548 --> 05:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of climate change and
 
05:27:46.910 --> 05:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
what we can do on an individual and on a
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
community level to combat it last summer
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
in part because of my work on resources
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh in a previous term and my continued
 
05:27:58.628 --> 05:27:58.638 align:start position:0%
fight against a corporate polluter in my
 
05:28:00.708 --> 05:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
town that has destroyed our water and
 
05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
environment some climate change youth
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
Advocates from 350 NH contacted me with
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
an idea to update New Hampshire's
 
05:28:10.350 --> 05:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
climate change
 
05:28:13.390 --> 05:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum in May 2014 New Hampshire
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
established the state model compet
 
05:28:15.760 --> 05:28:17.070 align:start position:0%
established the state model compet
competency

05:28:17.070 --> 05:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
competency
 
05:28:20.830 --> 05:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
standards but um that but leaves the
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
actual curriculum up to the school dist
 
05:28:25.230 --> 05:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
the local school distri districts to
 
05:28:27.548 --> 05:28:27.558 align:start position:0%
develop the specific written
 
05:28:29.830 --> 05:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum times have changed since that
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
initial disc discussion of climate
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
change education in
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
2014 we need more information and more
 
05:28:38.910 --> 05:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
topics we know more now now New
 
05:28:40.310 --> 05:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's education standards
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
addressing climate change received High
 
05:28:44.590 --> 05:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
marks from the National Academy of
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
Science but they need
 
05:28:49.270 --> 05:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
updating that that was good news that we
 
05:28:52.150 --> 05:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
got a a high Mark um and although we got
 
05:28:54.510 --> 05:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
a B+ for climate change education the
 
05:28:57.548 --> 05:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
reviewers did mention the connection
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
between climate change impacts and what
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
we can do in terms of energy and

choose to stay in New Hampshire After

in building climate literacy among
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire it would
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
provide support for teachers in

integrating climate change in their

speak up about climate change in front
 
05:31:16.910 --> 05:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
of policy makers and you are going to be
 
05:31:19.390 --> 05:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
hearing from quite a few of them the
 
05:31:22.190 --> 05:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
advocacy team from 350 NH has attended
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
Board of Education meetings and have
 
05:31:26.590 --> 05:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
given presentations on why it is so
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
important to update the climate change
 
05:31:31.628 --> 05:31:31.638 align:start position:0%
curriculum these youth Advocates have
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
written letters to the editor prepared
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
both written and verbal testimony and
 
05:31:38.510 --> 05:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
plan on holding rallies to get the word
 
05:31:43.350 --> 05:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
out they want to be heard let's not wait
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
until our only response to climate
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
change is disaster management this house
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
resolution suggests that new hampsh New
 
05:31:54.270 --> 05:31:54.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consider changes and additions
 
05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
to create a more robust climate change
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum in New Hampshire that gives
 
05:32:02.390 --> 05:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
our youth a at the table and a say in a
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
future that will someday belong to
 
05:32:08.948 --> 05:32:08.958 align:start position:0%
them now I've handed out uh an amendment
 
05:32:12.030 --> 05:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh after meeting with with uh a few uh
 
05:32:15.190 --> 05:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
groups we've we've changed the wording
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
slightly on on the house resolution so
 
05:32:23.670 --> 05:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.110 --> 05:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um we we changed number one
 
05:32:31.990 --> 05:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
yes number one and then line eight uh
 
05:32:38.190 --> 05:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
six and through eight um the reasons for
 
05:32:42.270 --> 05:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
the changes is um we wanted to remove in
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
what what some felt was inflammatory
 
05:32:48.150 --> 05:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
language in section one uh number one of
 
05:32:51.110 --> 05:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
the of the um of the
 
05:32:54.868 --> 05:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
resolution um and in the whereas
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
starting with line eight we just focused
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
more on the uh environment the
 
05:33:00.000 --> 05:33:01.230 align:start position:0%
more on the uh environment the
enironmental

05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
enironmental
 
05:33:03.868 --> 05:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
impact the biggest change however is in
 
05:33:06.270 --> 05:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
the resolve section at the bottom of the
 
05:33:09.390 --> 05:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh house resolution where we have now
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
called in the Department of Health and
 
05:33:13.948 --> 05:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
Human Services as well as Dees to work
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to compile and
 
05:33:17.868 --> 05:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
disseminate robust climate education
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
curricula to schools now why would we
 
05:33:24.750 --> 05:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
use DHHS and Dees for curriculum they
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
actually have uh there's a precedent
 
05:33:29.150 --> 05:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
there's there's a few precedents Dees
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
and dhh s have experienced getting
 
05:33:33.868 --> 05:33:33.878 align:start position:0%
health and environmental information out
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
to our
 
05:33:39.070 --> 05:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
residents the the NH DHHS tick
 
05:33:41.910 --> 05:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum kits are a great example of
 
05:33:45.628 --> 05:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
free and available written material DHHS
 
05:33:48.350 --> 05:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
also has and has created and
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
disseminated pfast guidelines for
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
adults and then DHHS in collaboration
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
with Dees has a re resource for adult
 
05:33:59.070 --> 05:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
education called the New Hampshire
 
05:34:00.948 --> 05:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
environmental health guide that helps
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
people find the appropriate State
 
05:34:04.750 --> 05:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
resource or agency to address
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns so these two
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
agencies would be the the best to help
 
05:34:13.070 --> 05:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
develop a more robust climate change
 
05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum and I'm very very happy to
 
05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
05:34:18.750 --> 05:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
05:34:21.628 --> 05:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
committee represent cordelli U thank you
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
um I I think I might agree with you on
 
05:34:26.910 --> 05:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
on one point anyway um that's climate
 
05:34:26.920 --> 05:34:28.030 align:start position:0%
on one point anyway um that's climate
change

05:34:28.030 --> 05:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
anxiety um see seems to me that we all
 
05:34:35.708 --> 05:34:35.718 align:start position:0%
have done um quite a bit to cause
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
climate change anxiety um in our young
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
people um going back to John KY and his
 
05:34:45.628 --> 05:34:45.638 align:start position:0%
book I I think his original um estimates
 
05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
were that uh the planet by now would be
 
05:34:51.910 --> 05:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
inhabitable because of climate change or
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
I guess it was called I don't know if
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's climate change or global warming I
 
05:34:57.390 --> 05:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
I get confused about which term is um
 
05:35:00.030 --> 05:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
proper at the moment but um don't you
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
think that we all um have caused um
 
05:35:06.590 --> 05:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
climate related anxiety in our students
 
05:35:09.670 --> 05:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
which is part of I think the so-called
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
mental health C crisis in our schools do
 
05:35:16.948 --> 05:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
I think that we've caused it yes um I
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
think it exists um I think the the
 
05:35:22.270 --> 05:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
example that you gave of John kry he it
 
05:35:23.990 --> 05:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
he did the best job he could do with the
 
05:35:25.750 --> 05:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
information he had at the time so some
 
05:35:28.310 --> 05:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
of these projections fell short some of
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
them were over over overly optimistic um
 
05:35:34.350 --> 05:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
we don't have to do anything these
 
05:35:36.310 --> 05:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
students are smart they're seeing that
 
05:35:37.830 --> 05:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
we just went through a winter with no
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
snow they're seeing that our summers are
 
05:35:43.270 --> 05:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
are wetter now uh there's a farmer in my
 
05:35:45.750 --> 05:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
town because of the the rainfall this
 
05:35:51.390 --> 05:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
summer lost 100% of his grape crop 100%
 
05:35:53.910 --> 05:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know if that
 
05:35:57.868 --> 05:35:57.878 align:start position:0%
continues I'm going to be anxious about
 
05:36:00.110 --> 05:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
it other questions from the committee
 
05:36:02.070 --> 05:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
05:36:03.708 --> 05:36:03.718 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much representative for
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I understand that
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
this is a resolution which is different
 
05:36:10.070 --> 05:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
than a bill there's a bit of a
 
05:36:12.670 --> 05:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
difference but I'm a little bit confused
 
05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
as to some of the definitions within the
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
bill there seems to be some vag vague
 
05:36:22.030 --> 05:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
wording I guess for one example what do
 
05:36:24.510 --> 05:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
you mean by a robust climate education
 
05:36:27.150 --> 05:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
and what's your intent and I guess how
 
05:36:31.510 --> 05:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
would we Define robust
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
um robust to me would be filling in the
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
gaps and and adding what um what we have
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
now learned since 2014 about climate
 
05:36:44.150 --> 05:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
change so bringing it up to speed that's
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
my that's my definition of robust
 
05:36:47.628 --> 05:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank
 
05:36:51.350 --> 05:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
you represent Woodcock than good
 
05:36:52.750 --> 05:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon good to see you again good
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon um if if everything went
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
according to how you like it to go with
 
05:37:01.590 --> 05:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
this here what what would you anticipate
 
05:37:03.948 --> 05:37:03.958 align:start position:0%
the fight I'm reading 13 through 17 but
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
forget what it says there what what do
 
05:37:07.868 --> 05:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
you actually want to see what concretely
 
05:37:10.230 --> 05:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
do you think can be done I what is what
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
do you see after this in terms of
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
implementing this if it could be I would
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
like to see DHHS and Dees form some kind
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
of a committee and bring in Youth and
 
05:37:24.708 --> 05:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
Educators to to discuss this so that we
 
05:37:27.070 --> 05:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
can we can give seats at the
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
table and then ultimately I would like
 
05:37:32.110 --> 05:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
we're not this house resolution is not a
 
05:37:35.788 --> 05:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
mandate it it is considerations okay and
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
so we would like to see considerations
 
05:37:42.270 --> 05:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
for uh climate change curriculum issued
 
05:37:45.788 --> 05:37:45.798 align:start position:0%
from D DHHS and Dees
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay what yes sir thank you and then so
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
the next step after that what will be
 
05:37:53.948 --> 05:37:53.958 align:start position:0%
the next step in you mind yeah
 
05:37:55.788 --> 05:37:55.798 align:start position:0%
um I
 
05:37:58.670 --> 05:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're locally run all of our
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
school boards are local run so they have
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
the option of looking at these
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions and implementing them or not
 
05:38:07.470 --> 05:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
okay I mean that's we can't this is not
 
05:38:09.868 --> 05:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
once again this is not a mandate this is
 
05:38:14.030 --> 05:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
simply suggestions for curriculum change
 
05:38:16.350 --> 05:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
the last one yes go ahead so following
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
one more step from that assuming this
 
05:38:19.708 --> 05:38:19.718 align:start position:0%
went there and they created the the
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
dialogue and the the materials is there
 
05:38:25.830 --> 05:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
any reason then that the DHHS and Dees
 
05:38:28.030 --> 05:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't just provide that material
 
05:38:30.030 --> 05:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
those material that they happen to be
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
local school boards for their own
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
determination to use or not use I would
 
05:38:35.750 --> 05:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
love to see that but that's not the way
 
05:38:37.788 --> 05:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the towns they have local
 
05:38:39.468 --> 05:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
control and that kind of thing but but I
 
05:38:41.670 --> 05:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
would love to see a full curriculum yes
 
05:38:41.680 --> 05:38:43.948 align:start position:0%
would love to see a full curriculum yes
absolutely

05:38:43.948 --> 05:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:38:45.708 --> 05:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely further questions
 
05:38:48.430 --> 05:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you thank you
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward I'm I'm
 
05:38:52.990 --> 05:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
thrilled to see it I do need some
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
clarification on the amendment okay
 
05:39:00.430 --> 05:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
because the way I read it where line one
 
05:39:02.070 --> 05:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments says replacing the
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
11th and 12th whereas Clauses so I
 
05:39:05.750 --> 05:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
counted the
 
05:39:09.750 --> 05:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
whereases and I got to lines 21 to 29
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that's what you
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
said so if you could just tell us what
 
05:39:18.110 --> 05:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
part of the original draft is being
 
05:39:20.110 --> 05:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
replaced by the amendment so we
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly okay um line one
 
05:39:24.990 --> 05:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is is just an
 
05:39:26.868 --> 05:39:26.878 align:start position:0%
explanation that shouldn't be in there
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's not text that belongs in the
 
05:39:29.520 --> 05:39:30.990 align:start position:0%
that's not text that belongs in the
actual

05:39:30.990 --> 05:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
actual
 
05:39:33.270 --> 05:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill so
 
05:39:35.990 --> 05:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the amendment in the
 
05:39:40.110 --> 05:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
amendment lines three right to 10 where
 
05:39:41.708 --> 05:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
where does that go in the bill yeah let
 
05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
me um so line four is uh was
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
22 okay so from line 22 and then uh line
 
05:39:55.270 --> 05:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
24 and and line 24 yes so that the
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
wording on on that that second section
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
there that uh Roman numeral 2 um we we
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
just tightened up the wording thank you
 
05:40:10.750 --> 05:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
for the clarification and then and then
 
05:40:13.788 --> 05:40:13.798 align:start position:0%
of course the the uh resol down at the
 
05:40:13.798 --> 05:40:15.948 align:start position:0%
of course the the uh resol down at the
bottom

05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
okay further questions from the
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative have you
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
given any thought to you're talking
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
about compiling and
 
05:40:28.510 --> 05:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
disseminating a curricula or curriculum
 
05:40:29.948 --> 05:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
schools developed by uh the two agencies
 
05:40:36.590 --> 05:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned here yeah uh have you
 
05:40:39.310 --> 05:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
given any thought to a fiscal note or to
 
05:40:43.310 --> 05:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
the costs of doing this uh to
 
05:40:47.030 --> 05:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
and and to disseminate a curriculum we
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
need the standards associated with
 
05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
it um and of course and and curriculum
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
is a responsibility of the local school
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
district instruction and curriculum is a
 
05:41:01.750 --> 05:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
local issue in the state so our concern
 
05:41:04.468 --> 05:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
primarily is where's the the where all
 
05:41:07.788 --> 05:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
come to put this all together and then
 
05:41:07.798 --> 05:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
come to put this all together and then
disseminate

05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
disseminate
 
05:41:12.750 --> 05:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
it um initially we're looking at at sort
 
05:41:15.548 --> 05:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
of an exploratory committee you know
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
from uh Dees and DHHS working with
 
05:41:22.270 --> 05:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to sort of get this
 
05:41:24.310 --> 05:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
information out and get it in some kind
 
05:41:27.910 --> 05:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
of a form um you're right I mean you've
 
05:41:29.430 --> 05:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
got to have standardizations for
 
05:41:31.190 --> 05:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum so this is just the first
 
05:41:33.948 --> 05:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
step that will lead eventually to some
 
05:41:37.390 --> 05:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:40.590 --> 05:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
dissemination and just as a point of
 
05:41:42.990 --> 05:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
clarification has there do are there
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
ever fiscal notes associated with house
 
05:41:48.990 --> 05:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
resolutions not with house
 
05:41:51.070 --> 05:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
resolutions but in this case you're
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
going towards a development of a
 
05:41:57.548 --> 05:41:57.558 align:start position:0%
curriculum which generally speaking
 
05:41:59.310 --> 05:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
would be done through either well you
 
05:42:01.788 --> 05:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
done through the Department of Education
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh with a task force of Educators to
 
05:42:05.230 --> 05:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
come together it might involve technical
 
05:42:09.230 --> 05:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
support from UNH or clean Keen or
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
Plymouth uh it may involve other
 
05:42:14.390 --> 05:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and departments coming forward
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
um and organizations that are nonprofits
 
05:42:19.990 --> 05:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
are that are familiar with the topic of
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
being discussed and working
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together to develop this
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh however eventually to be disseminated
 
05:42:30.390 --> 05:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
has to be done through the department of
 
05:42:32.830 --> 05:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
education so this house resolution
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
essentially gets the conversation
 
05:42:37.150 --> 05:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
started M you know it's not a bill so
 
05:42:40.548 --> 05:42:40.558 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandate we we can't we're not
 
05:42:42.270 --> 05:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
making them set up a committee we're not
 
05:42:44.750 --> 05:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
making them spend money we're suggesting
 
05:42:48.110 --> 05:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
that they consider these these topics so
 
05:42:51.948 --> 05:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a it's a a legislative
 
05:42:54.190 --> 05:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
attempt to get the conversation
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
started and then and then once it's
 
05:42:58.548 --> 05:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
started we can go from there and maybe
 
05:43:01.110 --> 05:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
next term I'll have a bill on with a
 
05:43:01.120 --> 05:43:02.628 align:start position:0%
next term I'll have a bill on with a
fiscal

05:43:02.628 --> 05:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
05:43:04.510 --> 05:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
note further questions from the
 
05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative cascaden uh
 
05:43:08.150 --> 05:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick question
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
as I was thinking about this I think
 
05:43:11.628 --> 05:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
this this would be fascinating but do
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
you know if there are any climate change
 
05:43:16.830 --> 05:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
electives offered in high schools in New
 
05:43:19.270 --> 05:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at this point or you know I am
 
05:43:21.070 --> 05:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
not the person to answer that but you've
 
05:43:23.070 --> 05:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
got a whole slew of people behind me
 
05:43:24.510 --> 05:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
that have that
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
answer all right now I was just curious
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
because it would be in yeah yeah
 
05:43:32.070 --> 05:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
one resource you might use is the
 
05:43:34.670 --> 05:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
education Commission of the states they
 
05:43:36.430 --> 05:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
they deal with curriculum they deal with
 
05:43:38.948 --> 05:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
topics within the schools and there may
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
be another state that is gone further
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
than this right now you might be able to
 
05:43:47.030 --> 05:43:47.040 align:start position:0%

um chairman lad and distinguished
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
members of the house and education
 
05:44:40.150 --> 05:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me today
 
05:44:42.030 --> 05:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm testifying in support of house
 
05:44:44.830 --> 05:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
resolution 30 urging a rob a robust
 
05:44:47.910 --> 05:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
climate education in schools including
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
current environmental and economic
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
information um some of my written
 
05:44:54.270 --> 05:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
testimony talks about some of the very
 
05:44:57.150 --> 05:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
specific um experiences that I've had I
 
05:44:59.310 --> 05:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
work for uh the New Hampshire and energy
 
05:45:03.310 --> 05:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
education project um we actually do a
 
05:45:05.868 --> 05:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
lot of the work um around climate and
 
05:45:10.628 --> 05:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
energy education in the state um and we
 
05:45:12.750 --> 05:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
feel that it's important um that this
 
05:45:14.910 --> 05:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
resolution passed partially because we
 
05:45:17.230 --> 05:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
just want to set a precedent and so that
 
05:45:18.868 --> 05:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
school boards can look and say oh this
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
is recommended by the state the House of
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives thinks that this is a
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
great um thing to do in our school and
 
05:45:26.430 --> 05:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
so school boards can look at that and
 
05:45:28.948 --> 05:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
say oh okay that like that has a pretty
 
05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
High endorsement from you all
 
05:45:34.390 --> 05:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
um so in my work I have a great
 
05:45:36.590 --> 05:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn about energy and
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
climate with young people around the
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
state hear what they have to say one of
 
05:45:43.150 --> 05:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
the pieces that keeps coming back to me
 
05:45:46.430 --> 05:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
however is that as they learn one of the
 
05:45:48.310 --> 05:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
fill-in-the blank pieces I think that
 
05:45:52.190 --> 05:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
goes into a robust education is okay so
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
what do we do about it um and what I
 
05:45:57.788 --> 05:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
hear from students and one of the most
 
05:46:00.750 --> 05:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
important ways to to tackle Eco anxiety
 
05:46:03.750 --> 05:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
or climate anxiety is the ability and
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take
 
05:46:09.830 --> 05:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
action um when kids are just told about
 
05:46:11.708 --> 05:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
something it feels overwhelming when any
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
of us are just told about some of these
 
05:46:14.830 --> 05:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
things or if they're not told about
 
05:46:17.548 --> 05:46:17.558 align:start position:0%
these things and just left to wonder so
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
I encounter students constantly who are
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
like well I know something's happening
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
the example I have in here is that a
 
05:46:27.468 --> 05:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
student in Hinsdale was like well I know
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
what happening cuz I used to be able to
 
05:46:32.190 --> 05:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
play in the snow Banks during my
 
05:46:34.230 --> 05:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
kindergarten class and my little brother
 
05:46:37.110 --> 05:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have snow Banks they have mud
 
05:46:39.708 --> 05:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
Banks my own son is in kindergarten and
 
05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
I feel similarly like he comes home with
 
05:46:44.708 --> 05:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
mud on his pants not wet
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
pants um so they know that it's
 
05:46:49.468 --> 05:46:49.478 align:start position:0%
happening students know that it's
 
05:46:52.230 --> 05:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
happening but we want to make sure that
 
05:46:54.750 --> 05:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
every class has opportunity to think
 
05:46:57.230 --> 05:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
about okay why is this happening and so
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
the Clause your 2 minutes is up okay I'm
 
05:47:02.190 --> 05:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
sorry um I would just say also in
 
05:47:04.948 --> 05:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
closing that we have um we have a lot of
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
resources to do this and I'm working
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
with the students at 350 to build a
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
robust uh opportunity of resources for
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
school districts if they want to refer
 
05:47:16.948 --> 05:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
to that thank very much do you want to
 
05:47:20.070 --> 05:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
take any questions yes thank you
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald thank you Mr chair
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
looking at your rting testimony and you
 
05:47:29.390 --> 05:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
note your experience um um creating
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
workshops are these in schools and are
 
05:47:34.350 --> 05:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
they a part of a particular class that
 
05:47:36.390 --> 05:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
we should be aware of yeah so we can
 
05:47:38.390 --> 05:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
offer workshops Hands-On workshops to
 
05:47:40.468 --> 05:47:40.478 align:start position:0%
teachers um around the state of New
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um many of them are free
 
05:47:44.030 --> 05:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
thanks to our partnership with New
 
05:47:46.270 --> 05:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves so we can come and do
 
05:47:49.150 --> 05:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
energy and climate education in schools
 
05:47:51.468 --> 05:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
um and then we also have professional
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
development for teachers who are looking
 
05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
to know how to do this with in a way
 
05:47:57.708 --> 05:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
that's joyful not Doom and Gloom and
 
05:48:00.708 --> 05:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
anxiety produ ing um and how to help
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
students take action so we have a whole
 
05:48:04.110 --> 05:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
host of opportunities we also have
 
05:48:05.910 --> 05:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
equipment that folks can borrow if they
 
05:48:08.270 --> 05:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
want to do it themselves so an
 
05:48:10.230 --> 05:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum that's free online that they
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
can use and if I may have a followup yes
 
05:48:14.430 --> 05:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
are any of these classes for the
 
05:48:16.628 --> 05:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
students perhaps they have a course in
 
05:48:18.708 --> 05:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
the class relating to the environment
 
05:48:20.708 --> 05:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
and you may come in to teach part of the
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
course for the students not the teachers
 
05:48:25.350 --> 05:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
MH yep we can do that we do that a lot
 
05:48:27.708 --> 05:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
actually with u career technology
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
students who want to learn learn about
 
05:48:32.590 --> 05:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
green jobs we do that for um K through
 
05:48:34.830 --> 05:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
12 classes it can be specific to
 
05:48:36.150 --> 05:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
environment but it doesn't necess
 
05:48:39.150 --> 05:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to be thank you
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah represent whitcock thank you
 
05:48:43.510 --> 05:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon thank you for
 
05:48:46.030 --> 05:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
bringing your expertise to us uh the
 
05:48:47.590 --> 05:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
question earlier was do you have any
 
05:48:49.468 --> 05:48:49.478 align:start position:0%
idea about how many high schools
 
05:48:52.230 --> 05:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
currently have either an environmental
 
05:48:55.948 --> 05:48:55.958 align:start position:0%
uh act uh Club organization and or a
 
05:48:58.350 --> 05:48:58.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum in their Science Program I'm
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
not sure how many specifically have a
 
05:49:03.310 --> 05:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
club and because everything is like
 
05:49:06.190 --> 05:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
based locally and what what is offered
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes those programs also come and
 
05:49:10.628 --> 05:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
go so I grew up in mboro and we had one
 
05:49:12.468 --> 05:49:12.478 align:start position:0%
for three years and then it disappeared
 
05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then it came back I don't have a
 
05:49:16.990 --> 05:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
specific number no um I know that it
 
05:49:20.910 --> 05:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
often depends on interest Staffing um
 
05:49:22.628 --> 05:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
and right now there's a lot of interest
 
05:49:25.150 --> 05:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
we're seeing for sure amongst the
 
05:49:27.548 --> 05:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
students um and I got involved with a
 
05:49:30.190 --> 05:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
350 USB because students were coming to
 
05:49:33.548 --> 05:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
us with this demand of we want more um
 
05:49:36.468 --> 05:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today partially because they
 
05:49:38.590 --> 05:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
want me to be okay thank you thank you
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman you're welcome are there
 
05:49:41.830 --> 05:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
05:49:44.910 --> 05:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh call
 
05:49:52.270 --> 05:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:52.280 --> 05:49:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
orski

05:49:55.310 --> 05:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:57.788 --> 05:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
y I'll tell you the students handwriting
 
05:49:59.468 --> 05:49:59.478 align:start position:0%
here is much better than I've seen some
 
05:50:02.468 --> 05:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
from some of the adults really they need
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
a little course in penmanship but you're
 
05:50:08.910 --> 05:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
doing good job here keep it up okay um
 
05:50:10.830 --> 05:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Sonia wosi and I'm a
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
nsha High School North senior I live at
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
23 B G Parkway in nsha I support hr30
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
because I believe that all students
 
05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
deserve their resources and teaching to
 
05:50:20.590 --> 05:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
be climate literate and to take
 
05:50:22.468 --> 05:50:22.478 align:start position:0%
advantage of the opportunities that are
 
05:50:25.350 --> 05:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
growing green economy offers last year
 
05:50:26.990 --> 05:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
as a High School junior I had the
 
05:50:28.990 --> 05:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take AP environmental
 
05:50:31.788 --> 05:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
science I was lucky I realized that many
 
05:50:33.230 --> 05:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
other students don't get this
 
05:50:35.070 --> 05:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
information on climate that they are
 
05:50:36.430 --> 05:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
missing out on a subject matter that
 
05:50:37.948 --> 05:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
will impact them for the rest of their
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
lives they weren't given the knowledge
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
they needed to feel confident in a
 
05:50:43.510 --> 05:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
changing world or to make a change in
 
05:50:45.750 --> 05:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
their own communities and most
 
05:50:47.868 --> 05:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
significantly they weren't given the
 
05:50:49.830 --> 05:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
option to learn about a growing field of
 
05:50:52.390 --> 05:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
green jobs or the importance of a stable
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
climate to New Hampshire's Agriculture
 
05:50:54.718 --> 05:50:55.430 align:start position:0%
climate to New Hampshire's Agriculture
and

05:50:55.430 --> 05:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:57.628 --> 05:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
tourism what is absolutely insane to me
 
05:50:59.390 --> 05:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we risk losing
 
05:51:02.948 --> 05:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
7,485 jobs and over 65 million in state
 
05:51:05.468 --> 05:51:05.478 align:start position:0%
and government revenue if we lose our
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
ski season to climate change and
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of energy in
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
2022 renewable energy jobs grew by
 
05:51:14.830 --> 05:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
almost 4% Nationwide and now represent
 
05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
over 40% of total energy jobs from solar
 
05:51:20.548 --> 05:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
technicians to innov Innovative startups
 
05:51:23.310 --> 05:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
workers to fill green jobs are in high
 
05:51:25.990 --> 05:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
demand we all saw the shocking flooding
 
05:51:28.110 --> 05:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
across the Sea Coast region this year as
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
we do deal with more intense weather
 
05:51:31.390 --> 05:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
patterns we are also going to need more
 
05:51:33.948 --> 05:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
workers to complete climate adaptation
 
05:51:36.548 --> 05:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
projects such as maintaining dams and
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
restoring washed out roads by educating
 
05:51:41.110 --> 05:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
students on climate we can show how
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
lucrative and vital these career paths
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
are and generate support for projects
 
05:51:48.990 --> 05:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
that prioritize climate resilient
 
05:51:51.230 --> 05:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure a stronger emphasis on
 
05:51:53.030 --> 05:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
climate will only make New Hampshire's
 
05:51:55.390 --> 05:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
economy stronger I'm here to say that
 
05:51:57.468 --> 05:51:57.478 align:start position:0%
every New Hampshire student needs and
 
05:51:58.788 --> 05:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
deserves to learn about climate in
 
05:52:01.468 --> 05:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
school and students as well as everyone
 
05:52:03.070 --> 05:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
else who relies on New Hampshire's
 
05:52:05.788 --> 05:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
economy are disadvantaged when we do not
 
05:52:07.708 --> 05:52:07.718 align:start position:0%
recognize the critical value of climate
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
education I ask you will you do the
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
right thing for New Hampshire students
 
05:52:14.270 --> 05:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
our future and our state's environment
 
05:52:14.280 --> 05:52:15.548 align:start position:0%
our future and our state's environment
and

05:52:15.548 --> 05:52:15.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
economy um and I'm open to questions and
 
05:52:20.670 --> 05:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer as best I can thank
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
05:52:25.430 --> 05:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.750 --> 05:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee when you took your AP course
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
were you able able to get dual
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment with one of the
 
05:52:33.110 --> 05:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
state universities at the same time I
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:40.468 --> 05:52:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.910 --> 05:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
Dave any other
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:49.708 --> 05:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
much yeah yeah well nashille I thought
 
05:52:52.910 --> 05:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
they have it live yes if all these
 
05:52:54.830 --> 05:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
students have testimony may make it
 
05:52:57.510 --> 05:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
easier because they're not leaving it
 
05:52:59.230 --> 05:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
you they written they're all written
 
05:53:02.110 --> 05:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah if you have written
 
05:53:04.750 --> 05:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and you only have one copy if
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
you're willing to depart with that we
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
can put it into the clerk's record here
 
05:53:13.030 --> 05:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
which it's important so if you have a
 
05:53:14.708 --> 05:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
copy just drop it off with one of the
 
05:53:16.350 --> 05:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
Reps straight off on the left hand your
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
right hand side here and we'll make sure
 
05:53:19.708 --> 05:53:19.718 align:start position:0%
it gets as a part of the
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
record um okay the next one right here
 
05:53:31.350 --> 05:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
okay hello honorable committee thank you
 
05:53:36.270 --> 05:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
for having me today my name is Elizabeth
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
bosi and I live in Portsmith and I'm
 
05:53:42.150 --> 05:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of hr30 today
 
05:53:43.868 --> 05:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
so some relevant background information
 
05:53:46.070 --> 05:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
about me is that I have a M's in Social
 
05:53:47.910 --> 05:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
Work concentrating in environmental and
 
05:53:50.830 --> 05:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
energy Poli policy um but I came from a
 
05:53:53.070 --> 05:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
teaching background I taught for middle
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
school and high school for six years
 
05:53:57.628 --> 05:53:57.638 align:start position:0%
prior to getting my degree um and one of
 
05:53:59.230 --> 05:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
the major reasons that I actually
 
05:54:01.868 --> 05:54:01.878 align:start position:0%
switched my degree was because of how
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
often my students would Express um
 
05:54:05.910 --> 05:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
frequent growing climate anxiety over
 
05:54:08.350 --> 05:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
the years and I appreciated the question
 
05:54:10.070 --> 05:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you asked about whether or not that
 
05:54:12.310 --> 05:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
was coming from things like some of the
 
05:54:15.468 --> 05:54:15.478 align:start position:0%
data that has not necessarily played out
 
05:54:18.190 --> 05:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
or also some things like media headlines
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
but most of the things that my students
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
were saying was contributing to anxiety
 
05:54:24.110 --> 05:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
were things that they could see and feel
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
some of the things I already mentioned
 
05:54:28.190 --> 05:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
today like shorter Winters um but a lot
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
of my students came from farming
 
05:54:32.788 --> 05:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and farming families and or
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
like the food business and a lot of them
 
05:54:35.830 --> 05:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
are losing business over the year
 
05:54:37.868 --> 05:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
because of lack of food supply because
 
05:54:39.430 --> 05:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
of things that are contributing from
 
05:54:39.440 --> 05:54:40.310 align:start position:0%
of things that are contributing from
climate

05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
climate
 
05:54:43.150 --> 05:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
change um so consequently I also noticed
 
05:54:45.310 --> 05:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
a gap in our education system and being
 
05:54:47.230 --> 05:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
able to give them the information about
 
05:54:49.468 --> 05:54:49.478 align:start position:0%
why this is happening and also how we
 
05:54:51.548 --> 05:54:51.558 align:start position:0%
can make it better we have the solutions
 
05:54:53.548 --> 05:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
out there and education is a huge part
 
05:54:56.310 --> 05:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
of that solution so this summer when
 
05:54:58.430 --> 05:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
discussing with a 350 New Hampshire
 
05:55:00.510 --> 05:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
action youth team about issues facing
 
05:55:02.628 --> 05:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
their communities and lives one of the
 
05:55:04.430 --> 05:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
central things that came up for students
 
05:55:06.230 --> 05:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
was lack of access around climate
 
05:55:06.240 --> 05:55:07.310 align:start position:0%
was lack of access around climate
Science

05:55:07.310 --> 05:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
Science
 
05:55:09.628 --> 05:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
Education um this was also reiterated by
 
05:55:11.430 --> 05:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
parents and community members across a
 
05:55:14.868 --> 05:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
number of forums that did occur so part
 
05:55:16.350 --> 05:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the reason why we worked with many
 
05:55:18.510 --> 05:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
youth on this house resolution was
 
05:55:19.990 --> 05:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
because of right now how bare the
 
05:55:22.270 --> 05:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
standards are of climate science um in
 
05:55:24.670 --> 05:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um there are only a few
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
standards total and they're mainly
 
05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
addressing weather patterns which when
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
taught in isolation of some of these
 
05:55:32.350 --> 05:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
wider topics that are introduced in this
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
house resolution um aren't as
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
contextualized so for example some of
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
the topics that we outlined in this
 
05:55:40.910 --> 05:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
house resolution were agriculture
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
sustainability energy and jobs in
 
05:55:45.548 --> 05:55:45.558 align:start position:0%
various environmental fields in this
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
sense one of the benefits of hr30 is the
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
outcome of Youth staying in New
 
05:55:51.190 --> 05:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do green jobs which
 
05:55:53.270 --> 05:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
benefits New Hampshire's local economy
 
05:55:54.628 --> 05:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
and also helps retain our youth
 
05:55:56.350 --> 05:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire which is
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
something that we've seen as a growing
 
05:56:00.190 --> 05:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
problem in the last few years your two
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
minutes are up all right thank you um
 
05:56:04.670 --> 05:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'll just sing in conclusion that you
 
05:56:07.510 --> 05:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
had asked about the finances of this
 
05:56:10.430 --> 05:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
potential um resolution so it has been
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
introduced in a few States but most um
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
concentrated in New Jersey and it cost
 
05:56:21.948 --> 05:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
there about $5 million in Grants um and
 
05:56:23.230 --> 05:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
they're still ongoing some research
 
05:56:24.990 --> 05:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
around that right now Connecticut is
 
05:56:27.070 --> 05:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
also planning to adapt the same thing I
 
05:56:28.708 --> 05:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
think that the number would be smaller
 
05:56:30.150 --> 05:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because we have a
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
smaller population um but just wanted to
 
05:56:35.110 --> 05:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
bring that number to the table too thank
 
05:56:37.788 --> 05:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
you yeah any questions from the
 
05:56:40.830 --> 05:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:52.510 --> 05:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
Kaplan I'm going to go over there now
 
05:56:54.868 --> 05:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
could I say about four minutes right
 
05:56:58.350 --> 05:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
this good break good afternoon and thank
 
05:57:00.750 --> 05:57:00.760 align:start position:0%

Solutions job opportunities and a good
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
life I urge you to move the resolution
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
forward so that the young people in our
 
05:58:31.390 --> 05:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
State know that adults are not okay when
 
05:58:34.350 --> 05:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
sea level rises and Storm surges along
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast Dev devastates roads homes
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
and livelihoods and we're not okay when
 
05:58:44.390 --> 05:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
the flooding in manad County also
 
05:58:44.400 --> 05:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
the flooding in manad County also
destroys

05:58:45.910 --> 05:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
destroys
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure why does
 
05:58:50.510 --> 05:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
hr30 matter to New

Maybe

06:00:03.230 --> 06:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:05.628 --> 06:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for having me my name is
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
Kaye Hall I live at 16 preserve Drive in
 
06:00:13.350 --> 06:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
Nashville New Hampshire and I'm a
 
06:00:15.830 --> 06:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
student I'm here today to express my
 
06:00:18.750 --> 06:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
support of the bill hr30 as climate
 
06:00:20.548 --> 06:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
education will eventually play an
 
06:00:22.270 --> 06:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
important role in protecting New
 
06:00:24.788 --> 06:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's infrastructure and Wildlife
 
06:00:26.548 --> 06:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
due to the climate change already
 
06:00:29.510 --> 06:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
prevailing today our state has already
 
06:00:31.708 --> 06:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
has already seen four severe flooding
 
06:00:34.230 --> 06:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
events in this past decade these
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
flooding events not only caus the state
 
06:00:37.948 --> 06:00:37.958 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to restore damaged
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
roads and roaded stream Banks but also
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
polluted a bunch of aquatic habitats New
 
06:00:45.708 --> 06:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these severe storms have
 
06:00:47.510 --> 06:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
allowed for more invasive species to
 
06:00:50.548 --> 06:00:50.558 align:start position:0%
enter New Hampshire's ecosystem as well
 
06:00:52.070 --> 06:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
what this climate change means for
 
06:00:54.350 --> 06:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
wildlife is also that birds will have a
 
06:00:56.910 --> 06:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
higher mortality rate and soil multiple
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
species of native fish plants will have
 
06:01:01.190 --> 06:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
to adapt to changes in their water as
 
06:01:03.548 --> 06:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
well which puts much stress on them and
 
06:01:04.948 --> 06:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
increases the chance of them being
 
06:01:08.070 --> 06:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
overtaken by invasive species this
 
06:01:09.788 --> 06:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
information has been taken right from
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's official facing fishing
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
game department right under this
 
06:01:16.430 --> 06:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
information on the website there is a
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
list of many ways people can take action
 
06:01:20.750 --> 06:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
to help with these severe storms in
 
06:01:23.270 --> 06:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
Wildlife one of those ways is for people
 
06:01:25.110 --> 06:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
to educate themselves on how climate
 
06:01:26.910 --> 06:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
change will will affect their
 
06:01:26.920 --> 06:01:28.110 align:start position:0%
change will will affect their
environment

06:01:28.110 --> 06:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
environment
 
06:01:30.468 --> 06:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
hr30 will only help promote this
 
06:01:32.468 --> 06:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
protection for New Hampshire which is
 
06:01:34.310 --> 06:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
why it is so important that is it is
 
06:01:37.150 --> 06:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
used to help youth understand early on
 
06:01:38.948 --> 06:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
about how to protect their
 
06:01:41.990 --> 06:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
environment in communities I may only be
 
06:01:44.070 --> 06:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
a student right now but I believe that
 
06:01:45.628 --> 06:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
more people are aware of what's going on
 
06:01:47.750 --> 06:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
in their environment they'll also feel
 
06:01:49.270 --> 06:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
the need to protect it and take their
 
06:01:51.030 --> 06:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
new knowledge with them later into their
 
06:01:54.190 --> 06:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
lives hr30 will help introduce youth
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
topics about our climate and the history
 
06:01:58.350 --> 06:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
behind it which again will help Prov
 
06:02:00.468 --> 06:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
provide future paths should they also
 
06:02:01.708 --> 06:02:01.718 align:start position:0%
choose to want to protect New
 
06:02:03.670 --> 06:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's environment and stay in the
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
state hr30 is not only about
 
06:02:07.910 --> 06:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
implementing more of a climate focused
 
06:02:10.190 --> 06:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
education into our schools it's a way to
 
06:02:12.190 --> 06:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
provide youth more perspective for the
 
06:02:15.150 --> 06:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
community they live in I support hr30
 
06:02:16.990 --> 06:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
because I love New Hampshire and I
 
06:02:18.590 --> 06:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
believe this bill will benefit my
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
generation and the generations to come
 
06:02:24.670 --> 06:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions not seeing
 
06:02:26.030 --> 06:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
any thank you very much for being here
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
today thank you so much
 
06:02:37.310 --> 06:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.868 --> 06:02:39.878 align:start position:0%
Goodman good afternoon committee my name
 
06:02:41.788 --> 06:02:41.798 align:start position:0%
is Eden Goodman I live at sixe Meadow
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
Drive in nashu New Hampshire I
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity I have to
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
speak in support of hr30 as a senior in
 
06:02:50.230 --> 06:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
high school nearing the end of my public
 
06:02:52.230 --> 06:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
schooling I've reflected on the
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
Environmental Education I've received
 
06:02:55.948 --> 06:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
over the years being told to turn the
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
lights off when leaving a room and
 
06:02:59.868 --> 06:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
recycle Beyond this I had the
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that environmental issues
 
06:03:02.830 --> 06:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
could only be tackled by adults with
 
06:03:04.910 --> 06:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
political power realizing that climate
 
06:03:06.548 --> 06:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
change will affect my generation far
 
06:03:08.350 --> 06:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
more than those currently in office all
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
I could do was hope that someway someday
 
06:03:12.350 --> 06:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
someone in my generation would be able
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to tackle these issues I was eventually
 
06:03:16.948 --> 06:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
given an internship opportunity allowing
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
me to learn more about food systems and
 
06:03:21.628 --> 06:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
agriculture I opened up to the idea of
 
06:03:23.868 --> 06:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
sustainable agriculture and agricultural
 
06:03:26.190 --> 06:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
impact on climate gaining an
 
06:03:27.788 --> 06:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
understanding of how soil can sequester
 
06:03:29.628 --> 06:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
carbon from the atmosphere and how food
 
06:03:31.868 --> 06:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
Transportation contributes negatively to
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
climate changed my understanding of the
 
06:03:36.948 --> 06:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
environmental issues we Face knowing the
 
06:03:39.628 --> 06:03:39.638 align:start position:0%
vast contribution of AG that agriculture
 
06:03:41.708 --> 06:03:41.718 align:start position:0%
can have in mitigating or exacerbating
 
06:03:43.868 --> 06:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
the effects of climate change I see how
 
06:03:45.948 --> 06:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
protecting our planet is not only about
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
conserving resources but also taking the
 
06:03:50.590 --> 06:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
actions to look after the health of our
 
06:03:53.590 --> 06:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
Earth these Concepts impacted many of my
 
06:03:55.468 --> 06:03:55.478 align:start position:0%
habits and the decisions I make daily
 
06:03:58.868 --> 06:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
when buying food and other things also
 
06:04:00.750 --> 06:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
this is exactly why I support this
 
06:04:03.030 --> 06:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
resolution expanding education on
 
06:04:04.868 --> 06:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
environmental issues will enable
 
06:04:07.230 --> 06:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
students to make eco-conscious decisions
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
and empower the students of today with
 
06:04:10.628 --> 06:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
providing them the background necessary
 
06:04:12.910 --> 06:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
to one day combat environmental issues
 
06:04:14.830 --> 06:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
as the engineers scientists and

questions see none thanks very much for
being

06:04:24.548 --> 06:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
being
 
06:04:37.230 --> 06:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:40.868 --> 06:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
TR hello my name is Sarah W drob I'm a
 
06:04:43.310 --> 06:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
senior at Nasha High School North and
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm support of the HR uh the house
 
06:04:48.830 --> 06:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
resolution 30 uh in my experience people
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
my age ignore the climate crisis or
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they will acknowledge that it
 
06:04:55.708 --> 06:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
exists but they won't take any further
 
06:04:57.670 --> 06:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
steps to try to help
 
06:04:59.150 --> 06:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
when I've asked my peers and my
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
classmates about why they won't take any
 
06:05:02.708 --> 06:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
further steps there's usually two
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
responses they don't know what to do or
 
06:05:07.868 --> 06:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
they don't feel like anything that they
 
06:05:11.390 --> 06:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
do do will be enough according to a
 
06:05:13.310 --> 06:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
recent study reported in linet a
 
06:05:16.190 --> 06:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
scientific journal 62% of Youth
 
06:05:19.430 --> 06:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
experience climate anxiety and 67%
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
experience climate
 
06:05:24.030 --> 06:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
fear as children our fears are often
 
06:05:26.708 --> 06:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
regarded as irrational by adults for
 
06:05:26.718 --> 06:05:27.670 align:start position:0%
regarded as irrational by adults for
example

06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
example
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
being afraid of the dark or the monsters
 
06:05:33.708 --> 06:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
under our bed however this fear is
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
rational and it's very
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
real a robust climate literacy
 
06:05:40.030 --> 06:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum in New Hampshire schools
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
would instill hope in younger
 
06:05:43.750 --> 06:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
Generations by providing knowledge
 
06:05:46.670 --> 06:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
information and solutions that make the
 
06:05:48.750 --> 06:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
climate crisis feel less
 
06:05:51.230 --> 06:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
overwhelming it is a big issue but it's
 
06:05:53.110 --> 06:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
an issue that we as students can help
 
06:05:56.430 --> 06:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
fix if we're educated on it properly
 
06:05:58.990 --> 06:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
starting at younger age the climate
 
06:06:01.708 --> 06:06:01.718 align:start position:0%
crisis impacts everyone on this planet
 
06:06:03.070 --> 06:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
if there's something for the Youth of
 
06:06:05.468 --> 06:06:05.478 align:start position:0%
America to be educated on it's climate
 
06:06:08.430 --> 06:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
change as residents of New Hampshire
 
06:06:10.270 --> 06:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
even as young adults or children we have
 
06:06:12.468 --> 06:06:12.478 align:start position:0%
seen the impacts that climate change has
 
06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
had on our state whether it's hearing
 
06:06:18.190 --> 06:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
our ski team friends complain about dry
 
06:06:20.430 --> 06:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
season um and not being able to get on
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
the slopes or we see that our younger
 
06:06:24.830 --> 06:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
brothers or sisters are not playing in
 
06:06:27.548 --> 06:06:27.558 align:start position:0%
the snow doesn't matter we see the
 
06:06:30.270 --> 06:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
effects we see the
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
impacts by educating us on it we can
 
06:06:35.948 --> 06:06:35.958 align:start position:0%
help change the course for New Hampshire
 
06:06:38.628 --> 06:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
as well as the world in the wise words
 
06:06:42.150 --> 06:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
of Sir Francis Bacon knowledge is power
 
06:06:43.990 --> 06:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
give us the power to help mitigate
 
06:06:46.350 --> 06:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
climate change restore hope in my
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
generation that our environment is not a
 
06:06:50.430 --> 06:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
lost cause and there is still time to
 
06:06:52.150 --> 06:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
make a difference we need a
 
06:06:54.310 --> 06:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive climate curriculum within
 
06:06:58.430 --> 06:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
our schools thank you very much
 
06:07:01.070 --> 06:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent thank you representative
 
06:07:03.070 --> 06:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for testifying and I'd
 
06:07:04.510 --> 06:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
have to agree with you that students
 
06:07:05.868 --> 06:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
should be involved and I always like
 
06:07:08.510 --> 06:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
when students come to testify my
 
06:07:10.990 --> 06:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
question being the bill is not only
 
06:07:12.868 --> 06:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
urging a robust climate education in
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
schools but it also wants to include
 
06:07:16.670 --> 06:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
current environmental and economic
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
information being a student how would
 
06:07:19.320 --> 06:07:20.750 align:start position:0%
information being a student how would
you

06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
say the curriculum should discern maybe
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
conflicting opinions since there are
 
06:07:27.270 --> 06:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
disagreements revolving this issue how
 
06:07:31.270 --> 06:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
should all sides be discussed okay so I
 
06:07:32.910 --> 06:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
am a firm believer that climate change
 
06:07:34.990 --> 06:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
does exist and I believe that when you
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
look at scientific facts those can be
 
06:07:41.670 --> 06:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
presented in with data um I believe
 
06:07:43.628 --> 06:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
however that there are opinions that are
 
06:07:46.350 --> 06:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
differing um I think as long as teachers
 
06:07:48.310 --> 06:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
and our Educators stick to facts that
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
are presented within the curriculum that
 
06:07:53.270 --> 06:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
it should be okay um I also think with
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
like other topics that we discuss in
 
06:07:57.510 --> 06:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
schools that may be controversial
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh our educators are generally trained
 
06:08:03.510 --> 06:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh in making sure that all people feel
 
06:08:06.590 --> 06:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
safe in the classroom
 
06:08:08.270 --> 06:08:08.280 align:start position:0%

I support the hr30 resolution as it will
 
06:08:54.190 --> 06:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
benefit the entirety of uh the entirety
 
06:08:55.990 --> 06:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and future generations

to come
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of climate change needs
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
to be addressed especially in younger
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
Generations as we are the future of this
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
nation there is no better way than
 
06:09:07.708 --> 06:09:07.718 align:start position:0%
implementing this than a climate
 
06:09:10.070 --> 06:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
literacy education program within the
 
06:09:11.868 --> 06:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school system and
 
06:09:13.948 --> 06:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
educating the Youth of New Hampshire by
 
06:09:15.750 --> 06:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
motivating them to participate in
 
06:09:18.270 --> 06:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
climate related events Gatherings like
 
06:09:20.670 --> 06:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
litter cleanups in public parks preserve
 
06:09:22.628 --> 06:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
the environment and keep humans and
 
06:09:24.548 --> 06:09:24.558 align:start position:0%
animals from hazardous
 
06:09:26.990 --> 06:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
conditions events like these can
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
encourage participation from everyone
 
06:09:31.350 --> 06:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
interested and will influence more and
 
06:09:33.910 --> 06:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
more events like this with climate
 
06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
education implementation in the schools
 
06:09:38.628 --> 06:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
the youth will also learn how efforts
 
06:09:40.350 --> 06:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
like pollution deterent events are
 
06:09:41.788 --> 06:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
essential to keep
 
06:09:44.590 --> 06:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
Society to society to keep New Hampshire
 
06:09:47.910 --> 06:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
parks and regions thriving Greener
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
sustaining our air breathable and our
 
06:09:53.230 --> 06:09:53.240 align:start position:0%
waterers flowing therefore I support the
 
06:09:56.070 --> 06:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
hr30 resolution as it will provide a
 
06:09:57.788 --> 06:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
system to to influence the Youth of New
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have a clear uh and concise
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge about climate related topics
 
06:10:05.548 --> 06:10:05.558 align:start position:0%
and influence our society to participate
 
06:10:07.628 --> 06:10:07.638 align:start position:0%
in more cleanup events that will keep
 
06:10:09.628 --> 06:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
our state pollutant free thank you so
 
06:10:10.830 --> 06:10:10.840 align:start position:0%

you for taking my question I know AP
 
06:10:21.030 --> 06:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
environmental Sciences offered in
 
06:10:22.510 --> 06:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
Nashville high school and I know it's
 
06:10:24.670 --> 06:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
offered in the Manchester schools do you
 
06:10:27.548 --> 06:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
have more environmental science is at I
 
06:10:32.270 --> 06:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
know your science is your school um do
 
06:10:34.990 --> 06:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
you have more classes on this then
 
06:10:37.708 --> 06:10:37.718 align:start position:0%
offered in the other schools yeah so uh
 
06:10:39.350 --> 06:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
I attend the academy for Science and
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
design it's a public charter school in
 
06:10:45.430 --> 06:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
nashwa and it's um it has other
 
06:10:48.510 --> 06:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
environmental science courses like um uh
 
06:10:50.270 --> 06:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
honors environmental science you have to
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
take that as a required course in ninth
 
06:10:55.510 --> 06:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
grade um for a graduation requirement
 
06:10:58.150 --> 06:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
and there you just you learn about uh
 
06:11:00.788 --> 06:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
environmental science and yes there is
 
06:11:02.510 --> 06:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
AP environmental science offered at my
 
06:11:02.520 --> 06:11:03.990 align:start position:0%
AP environmental science offered at my
school

06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:11:07.830 --> 06:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes R Bayon thank you I

just want to follow up on your answer to
 
06:11:12.788 --> 06:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
that question have you noted a
 
06:11:15.230 --> 06:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
difference in your environmental
 
06:11:17.670 --> 06:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge having that AP class as a
 
06:11:20.750 --> 06:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
freshman compared to your peers who
 
06:11:22.590 --> 06:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
clearly are very interested in this
 
06:11:25.708 --> 06:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
topic but perhaps didn't have access to
 
06:11:28.868 --> 06:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
that coursework so so soon if at all
 
06:11:31.590 --> 06:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um so in my environmental science
 
06:11:34.670 --> 06:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
class uh it we did learn a lot about uh
 
06:11:37.030 --> 06:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
climate education because my school is
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
also um like influences this among their
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
students as well um and yes we learned a
 
06:11:47.590 --> 06:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
lot more uh like I would say it really
 
06:11:50.750 --> 06:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
did help me uh learn more um and if
 
06:11:53.590 --> 06:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
students that didn't take this course uh
 
06:11:55.310 --> 06:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
if I didn't take this course I wouldn't
 
06:11:57.948 --> 06:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
have as much knowledge as had today um
 
06:12:00.590 --> 06:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
on specific topics related to that so
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
yes it does help thank you thank you
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.440 --> 06:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
Barry

06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:34.708 --> 06:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Taylor Barry
 
06:12:36.590 --> 06:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm a senior at Nash High School
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
North I'm here today to testify in favor
 
06:12:39.520 --> 06:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
North I'm here today to testify in favor
of

06:12:40.310 --> 06:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:12:43.230 --> 06:12:43.240 align:start position:0%
hr30 the climate crisis is no longer
 
06:12:45.628 --> 06:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
some distant threat in the future it's
 
06:12:48.468 --> 06:12:48.478 align:start position:0%
here that's scary especially for today's
 
06:12:51.390 --> 06:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
youth this fear and anxiety stretches
 
06:12:54.230 --> 06:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
into every aspect of Our Lives it's hard
 
06:12:57.150 --> 06:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
to focus on building a a success future
 
06:12:59.230 --> 06:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
when we know that it will be threatened
 
06:13:01.590 --> 06:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
by climate change that's why we're here
 
06:13:03.788 --> 06:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
today as the next generation of
 
06:13:05.948 --> 06:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
scientists leaders and businessmen and
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
women we are demanding that action be
 
06:13:10.510 --> 06:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
taken to save our planet and save our
 
06:13:12.830 --> 06:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
futures one of the most impactful
 
06:13:15.430 --> 06:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
climate change mitigation strategies is
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
education a successful climate literacy
 
06:13:21.030 --> 06:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum is comprehensive it details
 
06:13:22.910 --> 06:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
not only the scientific aspects of
 
06:13:25.030 --> 06:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
climate change but the socioeconomic
 
06:13:28.150 --> 06:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
ones as well this builds urgency among
 
06:13:31.230 --> 06:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
students the curriculum then converts
 
06:13:33.510 --> 06:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
this urgency into action by teaching
 
06:13:35.830 --> 06:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
students how to make eco-conscious
 
06:13:39.230 --> 06:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
decisions a 2017 study found that
 
06:13:41.390 --> 06:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
students at San Jose University were
 
06:13:43.070 --> 06:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
able to lower their Global carbon
 
06:13:46.548 --> 06:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
footprint by 2.86 tons per year after
 
06:13:49.750 --> 06:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
taking a global climate change course if
 
06:13:53.670 --> 06:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
each new hes 170,000 students in public
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
schools were able to do this then
 
06:13:57.910 --> 06:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon
 
06:14:00.190 --> 06:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
dioxide would be prevented from entering
 
06:14:03.430 --> 06:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere each year in addition to
 
06:14:05.628 --> 06:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
inspiring students to take action
 
06:14:07.628 --> 06:14:07.638 align:start position:0%
climate change curriculum details
 
06:14:08.990 --> 06:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
positive developments in the
 
06:14:12.110 --> 06:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
environmental field as a result hope is
 
06:14:14.468 --> 06:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
spread among students which combats fear
 
06:14:14.478 --> 06:14:15.830 align:start position:0%
spread among students which combats fear
and

06:14:15.830 --> 06:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:14:19.510 --> 06:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
anxiety according to a bipartisan um
 
06:14:23.788 --> 06:14:23.798 align:start position:0%
2023 Yale study 75% of people across New
 
06:14:25.868 --> 06:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Across the Nation agree
 
06:14:27.670 --> 06:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
with this statement that global warming
 
06:14:31.150 --> 06:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
should be taught in schools we did too
 
06:14:33.670 --> 06:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
as students Educators and activists we
 
06:14:35.628 --> 06:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
are demanding that action be taken to
 
06:14:38.030 --> 06:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
mitigate the climate crisis there is no
 
06:14:40.788 --> 06:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
better time to take that action than now
 
06:14:43.868 --> 06:14:43.878 align:start position:0%
thank you and I am open in questions
 
06:14:45.830 --> 06:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
06:14:48.868 --> 06:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
much represent Damon thank you could you
 
06:14:51.270 --> 06:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
just please repeat the statistic you
 
06:14:53.750 --> 06:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
just gave us about the number of tons
 
06:14:56.670 --> 06:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
per year decrease in I think it was
 
06:15:00.030 --> 06:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
carbon impact so at San Jose University
 
06:15:02.430 --> 06:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
after taking a year-long global climate
 
06:15:04.468 --> 06:15:04.478 align:start position:0%
change course students were able to
 
06:15:06.628 --> 06:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
lower their foot uh their carbon
 
06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
footprint by 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide
 
06:15:10.440 --> 06:15:13.150 align:start position:0%
footprint by 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide
per

06:15:13.150 --> 06:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:15.830 --> 06:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
year thank you very much for being
 
06:15:20.468 --> 06:15:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
Brown are there any other students that
 
06:15:24.788 --> 06:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
need to speak are we going to have
 
06:15:33.990 --> 06:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:36.510 --> 06:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Philip Brown I'm a
 
06:15:38.750 --> 06:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
retired High science teacher you gota
 
06:15:41.910 --> 06:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
wait till he gets oh I do I can't I
 
06:15:45.270 --> 06:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
can't use my teacher voice
 
06:15:48.390 --> 06:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay oh my recording voice okay so
 
06:15:50.910 --> 06:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm a retired coner High science
 
06:15:54.990 --> 06:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
teacher of 35 years uh I'm also a
 
06:15:56.590 --> 06:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
co-director of an organ ganization
 
06:15:59.910 --> 06:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
called SOS steam we could say it's uh
 
06:16:03.430 --> 06:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
save our students Save Our State save
 
06:16:05.948 --> 06:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
our species right and it's done through
 
06:16:08.910 --> 06:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
the use of steam education everybody
 
06:16:10.990 --> 06:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
knows what stem is science technology
 
06:16:13.628 --> 06:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
engineering and math we feel that we
 
06:16:16.868 --> 06:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
have to add the Arts so that students
 
06:16:20.190 --> 06:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
can interpret and share what they've
 
06:16:23.670 --> 06:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
learned through the visual uh uh written
 
06:16:27.750 --> 06:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
and Performing Arts and steam is
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
a is an authentic Science assessment we
 
06:16:33.310 --> 06:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
are looking for ways to do this right
 
06:16:35.788 --> 06:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
things that we can do as a as a society
 
06:16:38.390 --> 06:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
to help our students get rid of this
 
06:16:41.310 --> 06:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
anxiety help our students uh develop
 
06:16:43.230 --> 06:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
skills that will allow them to survive
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
into the future uh the backside of that
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
sheet that I handed out to you has some
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations on what we should be
 
06:16:53.628 --> 06:16:53.638 align:start position:0%
doing we've already focused on energy
 
06:16:56.350 --> 06:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
Alternatives we've already focused on uh
 
06:16:58.708 --> 06:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
civil engineering and architectural
 
06:17:01.110 --> 06:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
designs that need to be changed I would
 
06:17:04.190 --> 06:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
also like to suggest that we develop a
 
06:17:08.910 --> 06:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
spiraling K to2 science curriculum that
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
uses authentic Science assessment uh in
 
06:17:14.468 --> 06:17:14.478 align:start position:0%
the manner of the forest Watch program
 
06:17:16.830 --> 06:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
that I was part of at the University of
 
06:17:19.868 --> 06:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for almost 25 years so
 
06:17:23.548 --> 06:17:23.558 align:start position:0%
there is a way to do it but the the key
 
06:17:25.430 --> 06:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
right now things that I think we should
 
06:17:27.868 --> 06:17:27.878 align:start position:0%
be working on with our students are
 
06:17:30.868 --> 06:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
forestry Forest management tree growth
 
06:17:35.310 --> 06:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
tree monitoring and garden growing okay
 
06:17:37.548 --> 06:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
because food security is going to become
 
06:17:40.270 --> 06:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
ever more important and we get our
 
06:17:42.628 --> 06:17:42.638 align:start position:0%
students out and get their hands in the
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
soil we give them active hope for a
 
06:17:49.670 --> 06:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
future so how do we pay for it someone
 
06:17:51.910 --> 06:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
asked that question a while ago I'm a
 
06:17:54.350 --> 06:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
baby boomer right I'm I'm primarily
 
06:17:55.990 --> 06:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
responsible along with other baby
 
06:17:58.110 --> 06:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
Boomers for the plate that these
 
06:18:02.430 --> 06:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
students are are faced with Baby Boomers
 
06:18:07.910 --> 06:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
control $75 trillion in wealth I won't
 
06:18:11.468 --> 06:18:11.478 align:start position:0%
use the normal t-w the t-w that I
 
06:18:14.430 --> 06:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
suggest is that baby boomers
 
06:18:19.150 --> 06:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
tithe that we contribute 10 2 to 10% of
 
06:18:22.390 --> 06:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
our uh pensions and annual income or our
 
06:18:25.310 --> 06:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
wealth to doing things to help support
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
our children
 
06:18:29.070 --> 06:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
at the same time meline back in the
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
60s and the 70s developed an
 
06:18:33.270 --> 06:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
organization called the gray
 
06:18:33.280 --> 06:18:34.910 align:start position:0%
organization called the gray

06:18:34.910 --> 06:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
Panthers
 
06:18:37.868 --> 06:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
volunteers retired people who were
 
06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
willing to Champion and support our
 
06:18:42.990 --> 06:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
students into the future sorry your time

06:19:37.708 --> 06:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
background in this um I worked with a
 
06:19:40.548 --> 06:19:40.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DHHS um as a manager of
 
06:19:42.750 --> 06:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
the prior climate and health program
 
06:19:45.350 --> 06:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
that operated from 2013 to 2022
 
06:19:48.030 --> 06:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
currently a private consultant um a
 
06:19:50.628 --> 06:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
trainer and also University um
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
instructor uh today I'd like to talk
 
06:19:54.070 --> 06:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
about environmental health aspects of
 
06:19:56.350 --> 06:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
the proposed uh curriculum specifically
 
06:19:57.708 --> 06:19:57.718 align:start position:0%
environmental progress you should be
 
06:19:59.548 --> 06:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
teaching is in current in the current
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
form I'm neutral on the bill I think
 
06:20:02.830 --> 06:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
there could be some improvements
 
06:20:05.270 --> 06:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
made um the good news is that on a
 
06:20:06.830 --> 06:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
national and state level most of the
 
06:20:08.948 --> 06:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
citizens um have adapted well to our
 
06:20:10.590 --> 06:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
change in climate and his extremes and
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
heat and precipitation um even as the
 
06:20:14.548 --> 06:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
climate warms our nation's been able to
 
06:20:16.390 --> 06:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
reduce heat related deaths significantly
 
06:20:18.548 --> 06:20:18.558 align:start position:0%
by over over the last 50 years cutting
 
06:20:21.110 --> 06:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the risk of death in half in our cities
 
06:20:22.830 --> 06:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
in addition there's been improvements in
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
air quality um and we've reduced
 
06:20:26.750 --> 06:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
premature deaths by over 100,000 per
 
06:20:29.468 --> 06:20:29.478 align:start position:0%
year um and we've reduced greenhouse gas
 
06:20:32.030 --> 06:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
emissions by only 30% these are
 
06:20:33.910 --> 06:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
environmental health and improvements
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
that you rarely hear about from media
 
06:20:37.548 --> 06:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
and advocacy groups My Hope Is that bill
 
06:20:39.788 --> 06:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
will encourage an informed conversation
 
06:20:41.350 --> 06:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
within the legislative body in our
 
06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
schools we should teach our young people
 
06:20:45.788 --> 06:20:45.798 align:start position:0%
that this is a strong and healthy Nation
 
06:20:47.670 --> 06:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
um and when needed we have taken bold
 
06:20:49.868 --> 06:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
actions to improve the environment um
 
06:20:51.270 --> 06:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
and public health for all of our
 
06:20:54.070 --> 06:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
citizens um through bar partisan action
 
06:20:55.868 --> 06:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
I believe we need to teach um our
 
06:20:58.270 --> 06:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
citizens and youth about um our past
 
06:20:59.590 --> 06:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
successes if they're going to have the
 
06:21:03.110 --> 06:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
competency and the critical skill um uh
 
06:21:04.948 --> 06:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
critical thinking needed to take on the
 
06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
challenges in the future I want to say
 
06:21:08.510 --> 06:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
we have solved big problems before and
 
06:21:09.868 --> 06:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
we will again I think that's a big
 
06:21:11.788 --> 06:21:11.798 align:start position:0%
message that's not getting through to
 
06:21:14.590 --> 06:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
our schools um um bad news is the
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
climate is rapidly warming it's causing
 
06:21:17.948 --> 06:21:17.958 align:start position:0%
disruption in our weather patterns
 
06:21:19.670 --> 06:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
unbalanced ecosystems and threatening
 
06:21:21.468 --> 06:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
our health here in New Hampshire my work
 
06:21:22.830 --> 06:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health really
 
06:21:24.430 --> 06:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
discovered that probably the strongest
 
06:21:26.788 --> 06:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
climate signal is on tick B expansion of
 
06:21:28.750 --> 06:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
tick habitat and tick born disease
 
06:21:30.548 --> 06:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
that's really significant that's strong
 
06:21:32.590 --> 06:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
you can see it other things less certain
 
06:21:35.230 --> 06:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
but we know the number of days over 90°
 
06:21:37.390 --> 06:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
um heat and temperature are increasing
 
06:21:39.468 --> 06:21:39.478 align:start position:0%
and number of extreme weather events are
 
06:21:43.390 --> 06:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
increasing um time's up to times up all
 
06:21:45.150 --> 06:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
right I'll just say that um I believe
 
06:21:46.590 --> 06:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
that there's an opportunity to improve
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
our science curcum by including more
 
06:21:50.350 --> 06:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
information on on environmental progress
 
06:21:52.830 --> 06:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
and success but a few questions remain
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
what is the content of the current
 
06:21:56.070 --> 06:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
climate curriculum in our schools is it
 
06:21:58.910 --> 06:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
adequate or is it robust and if climate
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
current if the curriculum is changed
 
06:22:02.910 --> 06:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're examples of the best curriculum I
 
06:22:04.230 --> 06:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
think that if you looked into those in
 
06:22:05.830 --> 06:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
the near future that'd be very useful
 
06:22:09.310 --> 06:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
use um for this particular resolution
 
06:22:10.910 --> 06:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
06:22:10.920 --> 06:22:11.868 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
very

06:22:11.868 --> 06:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
very
 
06:22:15.510 --> 06:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
much uh thank you for being here

close yes you hit it you hit the nail on
 
06:22:29.310 --> 06:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
the head and pod lipney I'm from Chester
 
06:22:32.350 --> 06:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um cut my remarks in half
 
06:22:35.350 --> 06:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
and and really make make it very short
 
06:22:36.830 --> 06:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
because so much has been said and it's
 
06:22:38.150 --> 06:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
all great
 
06:22:38.160 --> 06:22:41.708 align:start position:0%
all great

06:22:45.230 --> 06:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
um hr30 introduces climate education in
 
06:22:47.708 --> 06:22:47.718 align:start position:0%
the High School curriculum as a former
 
06:22:49.708 --> 06:22:49.718 align:start position:0%
educator I have great respect for
 
06:22:52.070 --> 06:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
Curious students who seek to enrich
 
06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
their learning by incorporating
 
06:22:56.670 --> 06:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
challenging subjects into their work
 
06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
what knowledge at this crucial time 50
 
06:23:01.750 --> 06:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
Years After Earth Day could be more
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
important than understanding the root
 
06:23:06.030 --> 06:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
causes of climate change and its impact
 
06:23:08.310 --> 06:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
on a world these very students will
 
06:23:10.948 --> 06:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
inherit I'm a longtime resident of
 
06:23:13.830 --> 06:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
Chester five years ago I proposed a
 
06:23:16.468 --> 06:23:16.478 align:start position:0%
warrant article resolution in support of
 
06:23:19.070 --> 06:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
honoring indigenous people's day the
 
06:23:22.150 --> 06:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
town approved it persuaded I Believe by
 
06:23:24.868 --> 06:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
the testimony of one high school student
 
06:23:27.430 --> 06:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
who stepped up to the podium asking that
 
06:23:30.150 --> 06:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
students like himself be taught all
 
06:23:32.788 --> 06:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
facts regarding the history of Columbus
 
06:23:35.788 --> 06:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
ignorance is not Bliss he argued just
 
06:23:55.390 --> 06:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:58.070 --> 06:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
CL as students face an increasingly
 
06:24:00.708 --> 06:24:00.718 align:start position:0%
unpredictable environmental future the
 
06:24:03.390 --> 06:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
more science-based data they receive the
 
06:24:05.468 --> 06:24:05.478 align:start position:0%
better informed they become and less
 
06:24:07.350 --> 06:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
likely to experience feelings of
 
06:24:10.190 --> 06:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
helplessness and despair instead they're
 
06:24:12.468 --> 06:24:12.478 align:start position:0%
more likely to adopt The Credo don't
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
throw up your hands roll up your sleeves
 
06:24:18.030 --> 06:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
I've witnessed impressive results when
 
06:24:20.510 --> 06:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
students develop useful resources for
 
06:24:22.708 --> 06:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
engagement their knowledge builds
 
06:24:24.990 --> 06:24:25.000 align:start position:0%

schools related to climate change within
 
06:26:01.670 --> 06:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive curriculum children need
 
06:26:03.628 --> 06:26:03.638 align:start position:0%
to understand what is causing climate
 
06:26:06.830 --> 06:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
change and its impact impact on science

costs of climate change the article
 
06:26:21.990 --> 06:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed that since 24 million people
 
06:26:24.430 --> 06:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
worldwide have died due to floods
 
06:26:27.070 --> 06:26:27.080 align:start position:0%

06:26:40.910 --> 06:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
years after the event we have the
 
06:26:43.430 --> 06:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to proactively address them
 
06:26:45.310 --> 06:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
and create Future Leaders to prevent
 
06:26:46.590 --> 06:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
these costly
 
06:26:48.590 --> 06:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies here in New Hampshire we are
 
06:26:51.590 --> 06:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
at extreme risk for large wildfires just
 
06:26:54.510 --> 06:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
like the western parts of the US in 2018
 
06:26:59.150 --> 06:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
and 20 20 fires have destroyed over 2.77
 
06:27:02.030 --> 06:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
million hectares of forest changing rain
 
06:27:04.230 --> 06:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
patterns increasing wind speeds and
 
06:27:06.590 --> 06:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
increasing Heat have reduced overall
 
06:27:08.590 --> 06:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
rainfall in the Summers leaving the
 
06:27:11.708 --> 06:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
forest drier than previous Seasons a
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
wildfire in the White Mountains would be
 
06:27:15.990 --> 06:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
devastating to our precious State a
 
06:27:18.110 --> 06:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
wildfire would be deadly and cause
 
06:27:20.670 --> 06:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
significant smoke pollution asthma
 
06:27:23.110 --> 06:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
reactions respiratory failure and
 
06:27:25.910 --> 06:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular fa failure and other
 
06:27:27.750 --> 06:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
health concerns for Granite State
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
communities in addition to costing the
 
06:27:32.110 --> 06:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
state significant funding to control the
 
06:27:35.270 --> 06:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
fires and rebuild communities we must
 
06:27:36.990 --> 06:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
protect our state and Implement counter
 
06:27:38.910 --> 06:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
measures to reduce our vulnerability to
 
06:27:42.150 --> 06:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
wilda wildfires and other climate change
 
06:27:44.430 --> 06:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
disasters by educating our youth we are
 
06:27:46.350 --> 06:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
providing a pathway for them to create
 
06:27:48.468 --> 06:27:48.478 align:start position:0%
systems products and various protections
 
06:27:50.590 --> 06:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
to save our forest and preserve our
 
06:27:53.390 --> 06:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
health by reducing greenhouse gases we
 
06:27:55.628 --> 06:27:55.638 align:start position:0%
reduce the incidence of wildfires by
 
06:27:58.030 --> 06:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
reducing wildfires we preserve our pure
 
06:28:00.990 --> 06:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
air quality by protecting protecting our
 
06:28:03.150 --> 06:28:03.160 align:start position:0%
air quality we reduced asthma and
 
06:28:05.708 --> 06:28:05.718 align:start position:0%
respiratory complications it is all
 
06:28:08.468 --> 06:28:08.478 align:start position:0%
connected education leads to change
 
06:28:10.350 --> 06:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
which improves our state and the health
 
06:28:13.110 --> 06:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
