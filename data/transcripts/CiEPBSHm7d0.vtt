00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the subcommittee work
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
session starting with uh House Bill 1286
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
uh take them in the order of what I'm
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
hoping will be uh quickest and go on
 
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.430 align:start position:0%
hoping will be uh quickest and go on
from

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
there and so the first thing anybody in
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
have thoughts on this I at least 1286
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's the emerging land surveyors and
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
the Board of Professional Engineers um
 
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know what I remember from the public
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the the boorder of
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
land surveyors doesn't have a whole lot
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
to do they don't get a lot of
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
complaints um and actually if uh
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
director Courtney if you could come up
 
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
and you know confirm you know how what
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
we heard is they don't have to meet very
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
often uh whereas the engineers meet more
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
often and what their the the land
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
surveyors don't know much about the
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
engineering stuff and so it's not clear
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
this makes sense but that's what we're
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
trying to figure
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
out yeah Mr chair thank you Mr chair
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
repres Brown y good morning um I I
 
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
recall hearing that the the land
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
surveyors weren't overly concerned if
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
they were put together but the engineers
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
definitely were concerned about it
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
and yeah
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
there was some talk that if it was two
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
from each it would be okay but I don't
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
think that that's what the engineers
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
thought was a good idea so that's kind
 
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
of what I'm recalling yeah the question
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
there's two questions really one is do
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
they get merged and then if they do
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
what's the uh makeup of the board going
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
to be you know Mr chair yep a representa
 
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
of uh two two two points that I have on
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
my notes is one um the
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
Board of Professional Engineers can
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
handle overseeing land surveyors as long
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
as they're are
 
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.830 align:start position:0%
as they're are
surveyors

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
surveyors
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
but if you're trying to reduce the
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
board now and cutting down the members
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
on the board and that would add to the
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
engineers load on the board so they were
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
I mean I have 1 two 3 four five
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
opposition and no one single one came to
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
say support it so they were not opposed
 
00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
to it but the fact that you're not only
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
trying to merge the two professions and
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
you're trying to reduce the board and
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to put the burden on uh the
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
engineers who are already a
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
volunteer yeah that was a big concern I
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
agree and also um as I recall the uh
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's a wide range of different
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
Specialties the engineers and losing
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
people means they're going to have less
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
of that but anyway your your take on uh
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
first of
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
all yeah any of the if you have any
 
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
views on this and then in particular
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
um if there's you know how busy is the
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh the land surveyor board and then the
 
00:08:53.389 --> 00:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
usual thing is um you know are there any
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
particular other than the general kind
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
of antitrust concerns or anything like
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
that so thank you uh lindsy Courtney
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc um I think
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
that's a good summary of what we heard
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
at the hearing I would say that the land
 
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
surveyors board met six times last year
 
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
engineering met 11 neither board meets
 
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.430 align:start position:0%
engineering met 11 neither board meets
very

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
long um the land surveyors had seven
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
complaints and FY 23 Engineers had three
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
so neither of those bodies receive a
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
significant number of
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
complaints and I will say that
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
you know some of the
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
data is not necessarily relevant in
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
light of the changes last session you
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
know a lot of the need for engineering
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
and land surveyors to meet had to do
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
with lure but they're no longer
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
reviewing applications so we at the
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
office anticipate that a lot of boards
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
including those two boards will actually
 
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
meet less frequently moving forward and
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
for um less amount of
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
time okay um
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I was going to
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
ask other than you know any discussion
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
of changes to rul making or if there's a
 
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
complaint that the investigation gets
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
the point where they you know there
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be some professional expertise
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
or a final decision um yeah what else is
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
changes you highlighted exactly the two
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
areas one is in ruem and then two has to
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
do with adjudicating cases that are
 
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.590 align:start position:0%
do with adjudicating cases that are
valid

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
valid
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
if you were are viable and making
 
00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
findings of fact and
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
sanctions okay and for the seven in one
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
case and three in the other of
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
complaints how many of them you know I
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
know it's just one year but how many of
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
them actually got to the point where the
 
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
board had to get
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
involved so that those cases were under
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
the prior statutory structure so they
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
they reviewed all the complaints I will
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
say that the all of the boards review
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
all complaints at some point because
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
only the board has authority to dispos
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
position a complaint so at some point
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
after an investigation they'll review
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
the report of Investigation conclude to
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
dismiss or proceed to hearing in those
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
instances none of them resulted in a
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
hearing okay um so kind of follow up on
 
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.430 align:start position:0%
hearing okay um so kind of follow up on
that

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
so going forward um I know that the oplc
 
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
is going to do the
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
investigation um you know do they come
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
with some kind of recommendation the
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
board at least in some cases like like
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
if it's you know somebody's complaining
 
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
that they were charged too much or
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
whatever that's not really licensing it
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there are any of those
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
but yes that's what happened so during
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
the investigation of professional
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
expertise is required we either pull in
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
an expert that we've contracted with or
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
um you know for engineering and
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
surveying we don't have a lot of those
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
cases we'll probably recuse a board
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
member to act as an expert and then we
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
will make a recommendation in a report
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
of investigation and the board makes a
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
decision about what to do moving forward
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I know that there's a variety of
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
Subs Specialties among the
 
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.790 align:start position:0%
Subs Specialties among the
engineers

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
um well maybe I can ask if there is
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
there anyone here from um or wants to
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
speak about the um the board of
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
Engineers okay I don't see anybody
 
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is um you know
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
even if we we go forward with the
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
merger the next issue that I heard I
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
think I remember complaints about was
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
that by reducing
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
um what's the current makeup of the
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
board I mean how many you know F because
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's not in the bill because it wasn't
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
replace I believe it's five but let me
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
confirm if it's five now it leaves it at
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
five but it um two surve surve engine
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
which means they would be taking uh to
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
the Engineers off if it's five currently
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
yes it's five currently one public
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
member for Professional
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
Engineers okay and they have a public
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
member and they'd be down to two
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers and two landscape
 
00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:13.150 align:start position:0%
Professional Engineers and two landscape
surveyors

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
surveyors
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
which um Mr chair yeah and Mr Brown and
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
then man py and as I said there
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
was from I I believe from the engineer
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
side there was a lot of discomfort with
 
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
that two engineers and two land
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
they I think
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
they thought the two land surveyor was
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
too many well
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of questions to
 
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.629 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of questions to
director

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
Courtney uh one is the rule making from
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
the last years H how much have that been
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
implemented by
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
OPC and see any big gaps because of that
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
so we we've implemented all of the rules
 
00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:02.839 align:start position:0%
that we've been required I should say we
 
00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
have moved forward with the rul making
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
on all of the um rul making obligations
 
00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:10.199 align:start position:0%
that we received last statutory or last
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
legislative session they're not all
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
complete um because of the
 
00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
complete um because of the
process

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
um The Challenge remains that the board
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
statutes continue to conflict with opl's
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
statutes and there continue to be rules
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
on the books that conflict with our
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
statutes obviously that's outside the
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
purview this but but that continues to
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
be our
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
challenge follow yeah so I think this is
 
00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.310 align:start position:0%
challenge follow yeah so I think this is
going

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
to yeah there's other bills um that I
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
think are going to deal with that
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
including the non- amendment is coming
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
but my followup would be the engineers
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
on the board said you know they're
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
pretty efficient there is no issue with
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
the board having to meet
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
and very diligent and getting it done
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
very and the comment I remember that
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
stuck in my mind was we are Engineers we
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
are efficient we have the checklist and
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've go
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
through pretty uh quickly so is that the
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
experience that the oplc has or are you
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
stepping on each other's
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
toone no I don't think they um they're
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
not a board that takes a significant
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
administrative time I do want note um
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
because there were some comments
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
regarding Specialties you know
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineering versus chemical
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's under the
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
purview of Licensing and the board
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
composition currently does not
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
um that's not a criteria for being
 
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
appointed to the board so under the
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
current criteria you it could be all
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
Structural Engineers um and that would
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
not run a fall the statute if that's the
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
concern then maybe that needs to be
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
addressed statutorily but that was one
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the things that they talk we see that
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
in the medical board too right it's not
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
each specialty is not
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
represented that's not the idea it's the
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
general engineering that was not the
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
comment that I heard or in in having
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
one-on-one conversation or in the
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that that was a big
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
concern but the fact that the load by
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
shrinking the board the load load on the
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
volunteer board members is going to
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
increase reducing it from 5 to three or
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
72 it's going to be the same number of
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
members but they would replace two of
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
the four Engineers with two of the land
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
surveyors as I understand it yeah so
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
that was that was the big uh challenge
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to let uh representative
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
well actually if you have a brief
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
comment on this subject I was just going
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
to respond to what uh represent Manti
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
said yes the I I believe the Board of
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
engineers said if you do this it's going
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
to be more work for us okay um
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey and then Gould
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
just a question I guess is is there some
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
usual number of board members that we're
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
attempting to achieve
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
or I would say that seven five and seven
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
tend to be the ideal number um currently
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
seven I think is more common with um two
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
public members the public members Contin
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be the challenge for recruitment
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
which I think is why some of these
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
boards are proposed to be reduced to
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
five representative got followup Y and
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
if there if this was a larger board
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
could you more fully satisfy the
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
engineers certainly we have larger
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
boards I mean the Board of Nursing is 13
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
um Pharmacy is currently seven so that's
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
not something we we can't work
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
with uh representative gold
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
question so I apologize I missed the
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
very beginning of the meeting you have
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
had uh seven complaints and three
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
complaints and which is which so three
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
for engineers seven for surveyors okay
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
so my question has to do with testimony
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
we heard regarding mergers that if we
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
were to merge the two boards
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
currently my dyslexia here the land
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
surveyors only had three Lance surveyors
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
had seven okay so the other group that
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
only had three would have to come in now
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
for 10 meetings to address three
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
complaints that affected their
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
profession I think she said that L the
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
land Ser surveying board actually met
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
six times and the engineers met 11 I
 
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:52.870 align:start position:0%
six times and the engineers met 11 I
think

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
she no well there were two numbers no
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm telling her she was worried
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
about right correct me if I'm wrong but
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think think you're worried about him
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have to come in once per
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
complaint maybe no correct oftentimes
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing multiple multiple
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
complaints and it's not uncommon for
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
boards to you know wait for a meeting
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
until they have a couple complaints to
 
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
review we don't like that because we
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
like to move the complaints along but
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's very
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
common followup oh wait uh was that
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative G or yes yeah follow up
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
and then thank you representative G had
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
a followup and then man puty y thank you
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
so my concern is that when you have two
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
boards and the demands on their review
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
are different that merging them you know
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
the people who serve on these boards are
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
serving voluntarily and they're taking a
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
day off from earning a salary in order
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
to do so so if we're going to increase
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
the demands on a board that's currently
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
functioning in order to meet some goal
 
00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
functioning in order to meet some goal
of

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.909 align:start position:0%
of
merger

00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
merger
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
I I need to understand why we would want
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
to increase the demand on a volunteer
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
who's giving up pay and will have to
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
deal with issues from an a profession
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
they are not a part
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
of so again I'm not taking a position on
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
this bill the agency is not and I want
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
to be sensitive to the fact that these
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
are volunteers that said I would see
 
00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
these boards they don't spend a lot of
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
time um in meetings and doing board work
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
compared to other boards I do not
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate a significant increase in
 
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.669 align:start position:0%
anticipate a significant increase in
time

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
um because the majority of their time in
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
the last year has been spent on lure
 
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
which they're not going to be
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
doing U thank you represent Mantra thank
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so the other uh topic or
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
the uh discussion during the public
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
hearing was that with the housing need
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
the in increase of number of housing
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
projects in the state increasing
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be more demand for surveyors
 
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.510 align:start position:0%
there'll be more demand for surveyors
and

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
Engineers uh and and also the safety
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
issue of uh Housing Development um I
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if it was public hearing or
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
one-on-one conversation that might put
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
more Demand on the board and the
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
engineers said we don't have problem
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
with doing the work but if you have to
 
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
take a whole day to come and uh testify
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and follow what's happening at the
 
00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislation things are changing that
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
takes away a whole day for us not doing
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
the board work but then also not doing a
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
work so that was another concern with
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
the boom you know but that's I don't
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
think that's related to what we do with
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
their board it's related to people
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
putting bills in which is completely
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
separate no no no but the thing is the
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
board was uh saying we have to show up
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
to uh the board members uh from
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
the engineering board and land surveyors
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
board to say we have to be at the
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
hearing we have to make sure we give
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
our the oh the hearing in public hearing
 
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.230 align:start position:0%
our the oh the hearing in public hearing
at

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the that's question I mean isn't there
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
something published on what the meetings
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
if there's going to be um hearings on
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
complaints or something the board's
 
00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:27.799 align:start position:0%
that's an no noticed ahead of time yes
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yes no I'm not talking about the
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
complaints to the board from the
 
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
professional complaints but if there are
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
bills related like this bill was here
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
and they spent two days to be here I
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
understand that but I don't see how that
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
has anything to how anything we do with
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to have any impact on
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
that I I'm maybe I'm missing something
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
but okay let me see how I can put
 
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
it it's all very clear in my mind but
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously not making any sense to
 
00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:02.200 align:start position:0%
everybody else um the two points that
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
the engineer board the board member I
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
believe David Gil Board of Professional
 
00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:14.559 align:start position:0%
Engineers and I I don't want to name f
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
you know just just what the issue is so
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
the what the issue was that the board
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
members were saying now with the
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
increased two points one is with the
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
increased demand for housing and
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
construction and structure there's a
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
demand for lancers and the engineers to
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
work long hours because we need that and
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
adding to that if you're going to add
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
more responsibility to the board members
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
professional board members that's going
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
to take time uh and the third was if the
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
board members have to show up for public
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
hearing at you know know that's another
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
day that they have to take away from
 
00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:06.200 align:start position:0%
their paid position so now these were
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
the three concerns that I heard okay I
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
mean uh representative
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
Brown do you want to say something first
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
to you no I'll let you maybe you can
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um looking at the person
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of my notes from that
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
person uh said the board of Engineers
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
weren't in favor because of the workload
 
00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
they're all volunteers and they get 40
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
applications per month but that is no
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
longer the case they get no applications
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
now is that right they re they don't
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
review applications up front at all
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
correct there's a bit of a transition
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
here because as you might expect there's
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
a um some boards are not thrilled with
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that the legislation
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
transferred that authority to the office
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
and I would say Engineers is one of them
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
um and they do contain some subjective
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
requirements in their roles so that has
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
made it um challenging but they are not
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be reviewing
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
applications so thank you so to follow
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
up on that as as this morphs into
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
eventually what it's supposed to
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
be their workload should be decreased
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
which was the intent of this and become
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
more efficient in the in the short term
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully so
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and they and and that person also
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
said if they lose two Engineers that
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
will be they'll have to take more time
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
per meeting to review those applications
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't appear to be really a
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
valid point no or if they don't review
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
applications what I'll say
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
U right and you know we can if we decide
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
to go forward with merger we can we can
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
do something different than what this
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
says for the board size I mean we could
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
leave four engineers and add to land
 
00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
leave four engineers and add to land
surveyor

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
surveyor
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
I um okay so it sounds like my my take I
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
um at least to summarize and people
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
could tell me if if I'm wrong that they
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
are probably going to have
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
um less work to do than they do now and
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll have to be involved in
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
some rul making to fix the discrepancies
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
but certainly once that done it should
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
be even less representative Gould or
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was going to write
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
it down so I wouldn't forget
 
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.549 align:start position:0%
it down so I wouldn't forget
it

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:16.269 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hearing in this regarding
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think it goes beyond
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
this bill to other similar bills we're
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
looking at is that there's been a lot of
 
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.190 align:start position:0%
looking at is that there's been a lot of
change

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we're asking people to get their
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
heads around a lot of change and some
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
are struggling more than others and the
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
engineers specifically related to this
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill are struggling with the changes
 
00:26:38.389 --> 00:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
that have already happened and are not
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
fully implemented in some
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
cases or it's not enough that it's
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
gotten to their experiential level and
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's part of their Consciousness and I'm
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
wondering with the conversation we had
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
recent this earlier this week about the
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
oversight committee taking on some of
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
the Board review
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities if it wouldn't be
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
better to hold off on this and wait to
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
hear from the oversight committee what
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
their opinion is of the best way to move
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
forward which would also give all of
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
these boards especially these two boards
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to adjust to the changes
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
pretty drastic changes that were made in
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
year representative M py yeah I totally
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
agree with uh representative gold in
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to change too many
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
things one on top of the
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
other my concern would be we might lose
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
very good volunteer board members I know
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know we have Workforce shortage and
 
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
all that but this is also part of
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
losing volunteer board members who are
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
very uh helpful and not kind
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
of make that Hasty not I shouldn't say
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
Hasty but uh quick decision one on top
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
of the other yeah okay uh so um like to
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
move on to the others I my I'll give my
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
view and then everybody can and then I
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
I'll look for a motion actually um I you
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
know but I don't oh and actually was are
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
you from the land surveyors yeah if you
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
first no up at the mic I found out this
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
is actually showing up on YouTube so uh
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I was told I haven't looked
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
but please take a seat and introduce
 
00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:35.310 align:start position:0%
but please take a seat and introduce
yourself

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the opportunity chairman
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
leakas Simon Thompson I'm with Sheen
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
finny Capital group uh and we uh I
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire land
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
surveyors Association I don't uh
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
disagree with a lot that's been said I
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
just feel the focus has been on the
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
engineers and that's obvious there's a
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
lot more of them um just wanted to
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
remind the members of of our position
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
that was stated at the hearing is that
 
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill um if this bill were
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
to move forward um we would just want to
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
maintain more representation of land
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
surveyors it doesn't mean it has to be
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
equal to Engineers but if the current
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
makeup is five and that's hard and fast
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
and you did three Engineers to one
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
surveyor we would be adamantly opposed
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
to that the current bill is two
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
Engineers two land surveyors and one
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
public member right which that would
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
again we're opposed to the bill but if
 
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's what moves forward we could be
 
00:29:32.909 --> 00:29:32.919 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that uh it's just if
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
you were to change that makeup to
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
311 three being engineers and one being
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
one surveyor there could be an
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity where you could have a quum
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
for a meeting and there not be a
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
surveyor there so that that was just
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind folks of what I was
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
thinking we haven't made any decision I
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from anyone else but I was
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
thinking if we were going to continue
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
with the merger that um the keep with
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
the 4 Engineers today two land surveyors
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
and a public
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
member um yes and that would raise it to
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
seven which is not a problem I don't
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
think so yep uh I know you're oppos the
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill but there there's a wider range of
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
Specialties and engineers and all that
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
but absolutely but thank you for that y
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
that input thank you for the opportunity
 
00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
oh wait uh representative Brown thank
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair very quickly uh what's your
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
opposition because I'm trying
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
to probably is in my notes but if you I
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
mean if if you go back and and I was
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
trying to pull up my notes and I
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't find them either but is if my
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
mem Sur correct there was not one person
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
that testified in support of the bill
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
everybody that testified was opposed to
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bill um and again the land surveyor
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
both the chair of the board and the uh
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
chair of my
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
Association testified in opposition to
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
the bill but again with the same thought
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
that I had that I'm relaying to you now
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
is that if there if this bill were to
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
move forward the current makeup is okay
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
and if it were to change to what
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
chairman leas recommended they could be
 
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that so I guess the the
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
question then is what is the um the main
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
reason for the
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
opposition like if there just summarize
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
just briefly what are the real concerns
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
the main the main reason for the
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
opposition is they similar to the
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
engineers feel that the way they have
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
operated has worked well um there's very
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
specific land use laws to land surveyors
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
that while Engineers have some
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
understanding that's not their specialty
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
so those were the two main reasons for
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
the opposition okay um before I'll let
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
people speak but I want to hopefully we
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
can come to a uh a decision uh quite
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
soon and well I think this could work
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
and I would support it although I'd
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
probably suggest changing the board
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
makeup if we did that I'm also I don't
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
see that the there's a a large benefit
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
to doing it and and you can take a seat
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's thank you appreciate it um large
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
benit to to actually passing this to
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
doing the merger and um and I take rep
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative G's point that uh we've
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
already shaken things up and um you know
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to to let it settle
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
down before I mean some of these bills I
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
would have preferred if they came in
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
next year um
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
so people going to have a say I'd like
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
to keep the conversation brief because
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
we do have the two other bills one of
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
which is going to be a big deal longer
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
all right um represent G briefly yes
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you just a procedural question Mr
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
chair if we if we were to recommend
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
interim study remind me what that means
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
does that give us the year to look at
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
this so I'll
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
um you know if the options were between
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
let's say interim study and itl okay the
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
difference is that um
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
if we do interim study it has two
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
effects we can actually meet to study
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
the bill and we have on some and
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
actually you know solve some problems
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
and accomplish good things by studying
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
it interim study has traditionally also
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
be been used as sort of a a polite kill
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
because where there's not really an
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
intent to do much in studying it the
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
other advantage of interim study over
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
itail or effect it could see as an
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
advantage or not is that if we do that
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
then something on this subject could be
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
you know added to an amendment in the
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate could do something
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
but if we itl it then at least for this
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
year that can't be considered okay are
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
you ready to entertain a motion uh does
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else need to well actually we
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
can do a motion then we can have a
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
discussion so yes I am I move that we
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
itl on this
 
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
bill okay and is there a second well
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
I'll second it for the sake of
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
conversation I'm sorry I'll second that
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
for the sake of discussion oh okay uh
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of itl I think
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea I would back that
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
because whether we are doing interim
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
study or itl it's putting a pause for
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
this year so that the changes that was
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
implemented made actually what I should
 
00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:17.560 align:start position:0%
have done is is let representative goul
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
speak to her motion sorry first and then
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative Brown if he wants to
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
that's okay I was being
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
patient but
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I really feel
 
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.079 align:start position:0%
that given all the things in the
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
discussion that it's better off to just
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
kill this for right now let's give the
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee time to do their
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
well let's see where that goes and give
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
them time to do their work let's give
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
the board's time to adjust and a new
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill can always be brought
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
up uh representative Brown do you have
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
anything uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
so originally intent of all of these
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
coming down from the governor's office
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
um is to to make our process more
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
efficient and to make it as Fair as
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
possible for people coming in from the
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
outside to try to get license in New
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think that's very
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable um because there there are
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
certainly we we've heard some
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
conversations about it's a little bit
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
restrictive to get a license or some of
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
the some of the processes so that I
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
think that's the intent of a lot of
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
these bills is to try to be more fair
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
and to be uh make the process quicker
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a good thing and
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
certainly the The Institute of Justice
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
when they here testifying uh the week
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
before last the gentleman from there had
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
really good points regarding that um so
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's kind of the intent so I
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
don't know that we want to
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh uh put it itail it at
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
this point although I I I certainly
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
think that now I'm going to say the
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
other side of my own conversation that
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
letting the does settle may not be a bad
 
00:35:58.079 --> 00:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
letting the does settle may not be a bad
idea

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
overall um and there's a lot more in
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
here that we haven't discussed that's
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
not just about the makeup of the board
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
also um so uh I'm I'm kind of on the
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
fence about what to do with this and I
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
would ask one more question of either
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
yourself or or the oplc folks we talked
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
oversight committee but it if I
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
understood our conversation from the
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
other day the oversight committee's job
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
is not to
 
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
assess that oplc is managing the boards
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
correctly but it's a different test I
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
can I can speak to that I'm on it chair
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
McGuire and I are on that uh Senator
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
Carson's the uh the chair of it um it
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
isn't specific um the oversight
 
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.550 align:start position:0%
isn't specific um the oversight
committee

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
can uh sort of you know take a wide
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
ranging thing now it's it's going to be
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
driven to some extent by um Senator
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
Carson the chair's vision of it and it's
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
only had two meetings one was
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
organizational and the way it seems to
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
be going is
 
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
be going is
to

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
um you know get a report on what's going
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
on especially after last year with the
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
ru making how that's progressing and
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
then people who are licensed who have
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
issues with oplc not going to get into
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicating particular complaints but
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
if there's General problems then um you
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
know we we listen to that and and and
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
you know oplc gets to hear that and they
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
get to respond about what's going on and
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a real problem
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
identified and there's something going
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
to be done about it then in later
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
meetings we can follow up on whether
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
that happened but there's nothing I
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's anything in the
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
duties of that committee that says they
 
00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
can't take a look at anything and then
 
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation so um and and
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
although it's not a done deal what the
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that represent grto was
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
considering or suggested at the last
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
exec session was to add the duties that
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
were in
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
1676 to the oplc oversight committee I
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
believe she had an I mean that's not
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with today but she
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
had an initial discussion with Senator
 
00:38:14.589 --> 00:38:14.599 align:start position:0%
Carson and it looks like
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh Senator might be okay with it so and
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
I wanted that first I didn't want to be
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
involved in dumping a whole bunch of
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
work on her which she blindsiding her
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
but so anyway I don't know where that's
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
going to go it might might not um all
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
right representa
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
MTI yeah to just two quick points one
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
is on 20
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
1286 not a single
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
support for this Merchant number two is
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's making more and more sense
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
for the oplc oversight committee to see
 
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
how the process shift in process shift
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
in Minds set is happening and instead of
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
putting another change I think just
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
giving it a pause let it take and bring
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
in a new hopefully another whole year of
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
things would have gone through I think
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
makees sense R Brown thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
one more so following up on what I said
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
about making the licensing process more
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
fair and possibly easier especially
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
where we're short
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce uh for oplc
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
as we now stand with where we uh right
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
now that should have happened to some
 
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
degree is that accurate so the way it's
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
changed you're handing applications that
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
should make it sowhat easier for people
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
coming in as opposed to the board
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
process and if that's the case well go
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
ahead and let you answer that yes thank
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
you for I would say for the majority
 
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
large majority of boards that has
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
changed for certain few boards
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
um it's been a bit of a transition
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
because it has represented a significant
 
00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.390 align:start position:0%
because it has represented a significant
culture

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
culture
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
shift and we're trying to work
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively um but it it can be
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
challenging you have something to
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
add I think I think so Douglas so oplc
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
general counsel also in 655 it's
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
important to remember there was a clause
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
in that bill that said the current rule
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
structure stays in place until those
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
bills are or the rules are replaced or
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
they expire naturally so some of that
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
transition is just we're working with
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
the old system until the new system goes
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
through the Jael car process so it's
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of that to consider
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
as well and is there I'm assuming the
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
rules aren't expiring soon is there some
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
process to push for that to be
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
done changing the rules yes um so
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're so I can't speak publicly about
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
some of of our initiatives because it's
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
it involves Contracting um but we are
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
working on an initiative that would
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
bring an additional support to assist
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
the boards with rulemaking but I want
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I would say that our relation I
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
should Express that our relationship
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
with the majority of the boards is very
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
good but it requires a willingness from
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
the regulatory bodies who may not
 
00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily be on board with the
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislative changes to take affirmative
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
steps to modify their rules and I and
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
challenging okay I understand um one
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to ask everybody and it's
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
not aimed at any particular is if points
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
have been made before if possible please
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't repeat them so we can actually get
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
through the day um representative G my
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
question is thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question my question
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
is specific to these two boards have the
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
rules been completed and the change has
 
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.710 align:start position:0%
rules been completed and the change has
been

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
made no in fact they just propose
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
Engineers just propos rules that
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
contains additional subjective
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that we won't be able to
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
administer and we're currently
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
discussing in the office whether to
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
formally object during the jail car
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
process followup
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
followup so um so all the more reason it
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like it's not a good time
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
to for shove another change through if
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's um mitigating circumstances to
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
the changes being implemented from last
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.270 align:start position:0%
the changes being implemented from last
year

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
I can't comment on that but thank you
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
right thank you for for being careful
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
I what I like I think there's a I'm
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
sensing a consensus and I would like to
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
just take a vote um you know if anybody
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
feels that there absolutely has to be
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
more said uh go ahead but i' really
 
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:48.790 align:start position:0%
more said uh go ahead but i' really
prefer

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
yep how how much subject matter
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
expertise you have 57 boards how much
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise field expertise
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
does oplc has to make this transition
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
and where I can see the subject matter
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh review for applicants would be a big
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh part of
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
some yes so we cannot we cannot evaluate
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
complaints that have subjective
 
00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
components um no application should have
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
you know no application processes should
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
have subjective components but we're not
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
going to take that on um with objective
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
components there we can evaluate those
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
complaints and we have been for many
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
years or not complaints um license
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
applications in very
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
complicated um licensing Fields it's
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
just a matter of what the rules State
 
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
and that's where the subject matter
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
expertise comes into
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
play okay um unless somebody really has
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
something else they need to say we have
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
a motion of inexp to
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'd like to take a vote on
 
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.790 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'd like to take a vote on
it

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay um all in
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
favor or maybe the easiest thing is I'll
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
go through representative
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
Brown um I'm GNA vote Yes hesitantly
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
with the hope that this becomes more
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
efficient and better for the people
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire to get licenses
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
Bailey yes my primary concern would be
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
the size of the
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
board um okay um representative
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
maputi I think giving a pause I would
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
support and making the process simple
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes and representative G yes and the
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
chair will vote Yes on this one as well
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
so 5 to zero we're going to recommend uh
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
itl to the full committee all right I'm
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
going to close
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
the uh subcommittee work session on
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
1286 I'm going to open the uh
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
1285 um one thing I'd like to say is
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
that and this is to everybody not a
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
particular thing but if there are
 
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
questions let's say to oplc or anybody
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
else which are not directly pertinent
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
the bill and necessary for the person to
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
make a decision I would suggest asking
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
them after the hearing um and you know
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
director Courtney's been very responsive
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh to that sort of thing and I'm sure
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
other people could answer questions as
 
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.710 align:start position:0%
other people could answer questions as
well

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
said this is relative to merging the
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
board of Podiatry into the Board of
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
Medicine there's some similarities to
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
the um you know prior thing Al some some
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
complications so any thoughts on
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
this yeah represent Brown thank you Mr
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
chair so I guess let's start in the same
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
place with asking
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
oplc as we stand now with the rule with
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
the what has been passed
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
statutorily the the uh for both of these
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
boards has their scope of work decreased
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're just like we said
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
they're not handling applications so
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
each of these boards now has less to do
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
than they may have had if once the dust
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
settles yes correct actually we've
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
already onboarded medicine and Podiatry
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
into the new process and they are not
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing complaints unless there's a
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
issue of concern such as um a criminal
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
history records check that requires
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
review thank you okay maybe you've
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
already answered it but is the ru making
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
process that any that's required to deal
 
00:46:35.069 --> 00:46:35.079 align:start position:0%
with last year's
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh going well done or
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
whatever for uh for these boards the
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
oplc ru making is completed the board
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
rule making is not completed okay do the
 
00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
the rules for the either of these boards
 
00:46:47.119 --> 00:46:48.109 align:start position:0%
the rules for the either of these boards
have

00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
problems being in significant conflict
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
with um the statutes that have changed
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
no I would say that I mean there are
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
references to the board reviewing
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
applications we've just taken the
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
position that those rules are superseded
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
by our statute and there the pediatry
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
both pediatry and Medicine their rules
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
do not contain subjective components we
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
have been evaluating those licensing
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
applications for years so it the
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
transition has has gone smoothly okay
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mja py thank
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
chair how is the board functioning as of
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
now in terms of with regard to oplc
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
timeliness Quorum some of the issues
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
that oplc brought about other boards in
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
board um are there big concerns in terms
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
of me meeting and the Quorum
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
requirement so so medicine meets much
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
more frequently than patry Podiatry at
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
most meets um quarterly medicine meets
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
at least monthly and and they have a lot
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
more on their agenda they have a lot
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
more complaints um than Podiatry and I
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
would say are extremely engaged um
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
Podiatry it looks like
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
met four times last year they had three
 
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.790 align:start position:0%
met four times last year they had three
cancelled

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
cancelled
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
meetings follow up thank you Mr chair um
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
so is p you know
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
podiatrist uh concerned because medicine
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
is such an intense and so many fields
 
00:48:29.549 --> 00:48:29.559 align:start position:0%
will that
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
overshadow the request for the
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
podiatrist uh need or how will they
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
Bubble Up in the priority of the board
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
so patris is a small field there's about
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
100 lenses um which I think was part of
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
the basis for the request I can't speak
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
for the governor's office so certainly
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
the uh podiatrist member On The Board of
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
Medicine would would devote more time um
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
you know we heard some concerns
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
regarding Physicians you know and and
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
their handling of uh cases that falls
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
under the podiatrist uh scope of
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
practice so there could be a benefit
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
there um but certainly to that member
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
that would represent more time
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
involved okay um anyone
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
else okay is there anybody um else here
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
just to for for who Wants to speak on
 
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.069 align:start position:0%
just to for for who Wants to speak on
this

00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh if you could come
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
up and uh I don't remember if you were
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
here um last time but uh we heard a lot
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
of testimony on how wonderful
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
podiatrists are and the difference
 
00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
between what they do and Physicians and
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
all of that and I do not think that's
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
going to be pertinent to what we're
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
doing today so i' rather not deal with
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
that but okay um my name is Dr David
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
Conway I I did submit written testimony
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a whole lot to add to
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
that and I really came today to see if
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
you had any specific questions that were
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
not answered in my testimony okay
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
anyone you have something representative
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
so if I'm translating this correctly any
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
of these boards get
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
merged uh you as a member of the board
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
are going to go to that board and you're
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to hear topic that aren't
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
associated with your
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
field if if you're merging pediatrist
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
with something else you're going to be
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
sitting in the board listening to issues
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
about a different field than what you're
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
in I guess the overall question is does
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
that still make our process more
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
efficient and better for people coming
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
in from the
 
00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:49.240 align:start position:0%
outside to to get work here or or is it
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
as some have said make it a problem for
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
people to go to the board because they
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
have to spend more time listening to
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
items they wouldn't normally listen to
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
and that's a long
 
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
question okay first off I'm no longer a
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
member of the board yeah I'm here as a
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
public member having served on the board
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
having served on the medical review
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
and most recently I was uh The Physician
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
investigator for the board up until July
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
1st when the position was eliminated
 
00:51:23.549 --> 00:51:23.559 align:start position:0%
along with the medical review
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
my experience both in that position as
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
well as on the board is that there's a
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
huge backlog of cases of
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
complaints that when I was the
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
investigator there were when I first
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
took the job there were complaints that
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
went back to 2019 that had never been
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
seen by a
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
physician With The Changes here um I
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
think that just has the potential to uh
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
increase that backlog and to make it
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
less efficient for the board to review
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
complaints it's not an issue of uh gee
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
we need to do something to make
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
licensing easier uh right now the
 
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:07.720 align:start position:0%
board participates in compact licensing
 
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
which is licensing Physicians from out
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
of state who have no um who have valid
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
licenses in other states with nothing
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
that would be of a concern uh to the
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
board so it's fair uh director Courtney
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
could address that if you needed other
 
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.710 align:start position:0%
could address that if you needed other
questions

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
um just a moment I I want to follow up a
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
little bit on this and then um so look
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
at your your what you sent us um it
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
seems like a major part of the complaint
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
is the impact of the reduction of the
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
number of board members um I mean if we
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
decided to move forward with the merger
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
um we could address that separately and
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
and make changes there so you know if
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
the board size were not
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
reduced um or I'd have to think about
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
about maybe even uh you know increased a
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
little bit to add somebody people from
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
Podiatry would that alleviate a lot of
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
your concerns or what would be the
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
concerns in addition to that if that
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
of another concern was the difficulty in
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
finding outside investigators who did
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
not have expertise in a specific
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
specialty to review cases um that was a
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
real challenge for me as the
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
investigator I know it was a challenge
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
for other investigators as well um so
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
that if you ask me would you please
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
review this case on uh uh for a um
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
neonatologist somebody who takes care of
 
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
of sick premature kids I would be very
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable reviewing that I would
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
reach out to somebody with more
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
expertise okay um director Courtney
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
could you address and what I'm looking
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
for particular is with all the changes
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
how was any of this changed in
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
situation thank you so my position is
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
that the backlog in large part was
 
00:54:09.069 --> 00:54:09.079 align:start position:0%
created by the fact that the MRC um was
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
not meeting and was and when they were
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
meeting um we're committing to only
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing one case per person at a time
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
when you receive about 400 complaints a
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
year clearly the math doesn't add up so
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that with the new process we
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
are making our way and significant
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
Headway through the backlog by
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
leveraging um consultant work paid
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
consultant work with experts in their
 
00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:40.799 align:start position:0%
field to assist with that process it's
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
always going to be the case that
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in healthcare that cases
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
require expertise that may not
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily be expertise that a member
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the board has um that's just because
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the varied Specialties in medicine
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
and so we have to go outside and instead
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
of asking for favors and asking for PE
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
you know begging people to review cases
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
um the better approach is to pay them
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
for their work and to get uh true
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
experts to opine in a timely fashion and
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
move those cases forward so that's the
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
way we're currently handling it I think
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's how we would handle it with you
 
00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
know if if they were merged I mean we're
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
going to continue to handle it in that
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
in that way okay that's been working
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
well you've been able to find um um you
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
know people to to do that work yeah
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of strange cases
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
lately um involving specific Specialties
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and um we've been able to find experts
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
and contract for those Services okay
 
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:41.190 align:start position:0%
and contract for those Services okay
thank

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
you repr brown we're not trying to get
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
into a debate here no no no a quick
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chair with you so I i' I've
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
said several times that it's important
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
to increase efficiency and help people
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
to get licenses but if you would would
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
repeat what you stated last week that
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
that really isn't the goal of Licensing
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
well I
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
mean I mean the goal of LIC the only
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
legitimate purpose for licensing at all
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
is to protect public health and safety
 
00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.069 align:start position:0%
is to protect public health and safety
okay

00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
now in doing that if we believe
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
licensing is the solution then I think
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know we have a a duty to try and
 
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
have it be as least burdensome as
 
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
possible on the people being licensed to
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
redu to you know have have more people
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
who are available to meet uh you know
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer's needs and and you know to
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
to keep the cost down uh for the people
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
working in the field because that's
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to help with the whole efficiency
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
and meeting needs thank you okay uh I
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
know represent M py has question yeah um
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
totally how many fields medical Fields
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
approximately I'm not asking for exact
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
board that's a question I really can't
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
answer I no no problem uh follow with
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair certainly uh so this is to
 
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh director
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
Courtney um the
 
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.069 align:start position:0%
Courtney um the
specialty

00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
specialty
 
00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
uh in the field is uh expert field I
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
mean specialty field expert being called
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
or cons uh consultant paid consultant
 
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
coming has it been a new practice or has
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
it been something that you've used
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
before oplc has used
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
before I think I think previously the
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
boards and oplc had used it
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
intermittently but they had more
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
commonly relied on Experts um on the
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
board I I think that's problematic for
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons um you know in a legal
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
case I mean it's not just specific to
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
administrative law you need to find an
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
expert in that particular field and and
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
you need to go out and find that person
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
to testify to support your case and so
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing now much like in
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
criminal cases or civil cases requiring
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
specialized knowledge training and
 
00:58:16.750 --> 00:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
experience and it's working well because
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
the boards are able to be the
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
adjudicating body and the experts are
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
able to provide that opinion upon which
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
can rely or choose to Discount um so
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
your question about how I mean any
 
00:58:31.789 --> 00:58:31.799 align:start position:0%
specialty so in physician licensing we
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
only license The Physician they're not
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
required to be board certified so it's
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
any any specialist who is a physician is
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
licensed under the Board of
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
Medicine um all right if you have
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
something brief oh no oh
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
well just I I realized the mic the mic
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to speak sorry I
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
realize you've asked us not to debate I
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
just want to
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
that in my time on the board and as
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
physici investigator nobody was being
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
paid as an outside investigator I I
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
understand and it's not any criticism of
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
how things were done before or any
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
particular person so that's not all
 
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.870 align:start position:0%
particular person so that's not all
right

00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
so is this conversation going exactly
 
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
the same direction as our last
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
conversation yes uh it's leaning that
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
way um I I have one more thing I guess
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
um right now the Board of Medicine is
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
handing a wide R handling a wide range
 
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:32.309 align:start position:0%
handing a wide R handling a wide range
of

00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
Specialties and again you may not be
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
able to answer this and I don't think
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
there's and and sah you can uh take a
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
seat if you would take a seat sure okay
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't see anybody here to
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
represent the podiatrist otherwise I
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ask you this but I guess the
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
question is is there anything special
 
00:59:50.799 --> 00:59:52.150 align:start position:0%
question is is there anything special
about

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
Podiatry that would make it different
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
than just just another medical specialty
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
where that might make it problematic
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine I don't know that I can answer
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
it I would say probably I don't think so
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
I mean I've always viewed it as you know
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
a type of medicine you know podiatric
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
medicine but I know the P podiatrists
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
feel differently um actually follow up
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
to that our pediatrist MDS with a
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
specialty or something different they
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
have a different um what is it D what is
 
01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
it I should know well it's a different
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
they have a different
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
doctorate okay education is different
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
criteria I know that there's in the
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
doctor end you've got MDS and ODS and
 
01:00:42.789 --> 01:00:42.799 align:start position:0%
and NDS yes and they all kind of go
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
through similar but different things is
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
Podiatry within that range of difference
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
or something more much more different I
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
guess is so that's my understanding I
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
know that they disagree but that's my
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
understanding our board currently our
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine currently regulates
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
dos and MDS Y and other states have
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
actually separated the two but we
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
regulate both and so this is proposing
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
to bring in the additional um all right
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
um let Bailey go first he hasn't asked
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
anything and then I do recall them
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
feeling well I don't know what they felt
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
but they they pointed out that doctors
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
often don't ask people to take their
 
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.309 align:start position:0%
often don't ask people to take their
socks

01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
socks
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
off they were the only ones that
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually looked at feet or the color of
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
feet or they were just distinguishing
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
themselves that unless you had a
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
specific foot complaint the doctor
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily pay that much
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
attention to your feet whereas they did
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
I I heard that and I'm I'm sure that's
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
true to some extent um my primary care
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
doctor actually does look at my feet
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
um uh any any general visit um but
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's I mean there's s significant
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
differences between different Medical
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
Specialties as well I mean the
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
radiologist isn't going to look at your
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
feet unless you're getting X-ray your
 
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
feet Grant but okay um represent MTI
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
yeah uh couple of questions in terms of
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
um in other states neighboring how is
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
this going to impact our compact in
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
terms of if Podiatry and medicine is
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
separate in other states
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
and will that affect our
 
01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.029 align:start position:0%
and will that affect our
compact

01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
participation no correct the record DPM
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
is their um degree uh it won't impact
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
compacts I mean the medicine compact is
 
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
strictly for certain Physicians I
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
actually don't like the compact I find
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
that our process that we adopted here
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
last year is much more efficient um it
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
currently takes about six weeks to get
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
somebody licensed under the compact but
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
putting that aside it's not going to
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
impact our state participation in the
 
01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
compact there was two questions the
 
01:02:59.789 --> 01:02:59.799 align:start position:0%
second one was are sorry the podiatrist
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
is it separate board and separate
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Brown and then
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
representative G sorry he got in there
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
was she first I I think you were but go
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
on I'm not too worried about it okay uh
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh director Courtney
 
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
how many you probably don't know this uh
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
it appears that we have a separate board
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
for kind of a separate degree does that
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
happen often and that's a really broad
 
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
question but it seems like they could be
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
all lumped in medical and if the
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman back there disagrees I'd love
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
to hear that but compared to some of our
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
other boards so I'm sure Dr cway has an
 
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
opinion on this and I would be really
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing it and because my
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
understanding is there has been
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
culturally there has not always been
 
01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
acceptance of other types of degrees
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
like Chiropractic uh naturopathic um
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
even podiatric medicine and I think that
 
01:04:05.269 --> 01:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
may have contributed to why they haven't
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
been regulated under one board
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
historically um but obviously there are
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
differences and so yeah follow up follow
 
01:04:17.349 --> 01:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
up just because you could break
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
Engineers out into to separate boards if
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
you wanted to because some of those
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
disciplines are quite different from
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
each other this to it so any follow up
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
on that is there is the is having dos
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
and NDS together in the Board of
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
Medicine with MDS is that cause serious
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
problems has that worked
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay dos and MDS no that's been fine
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
with and NDS as well ND are regulated
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
separately they separ that's right thank
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
you that probably would be
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
problematic um representative
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
G Mi Mr chair I'd like I'm prepared to
 
01:04:55.549 --> 01:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
to make a motion if you're ready to
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
accept one
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
um I I'm okay with that Y and that's so
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
uh we need a second and what's the
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
motion first of all I move we itl this
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
bill okay and somebody want a second it
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
so okay so representative G speak to
 
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:20.670 align:start position:0%
so okay so representative G speak to
your

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
motion for many of the same reasons as
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
my previous motion on the previous bill
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
I think that we've made a lot of changes
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
that the board is continuing to work
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
through the process with opl I think
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
that we have an oversight committee
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's looking at how that process is
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
moving and rather than overwhelm the
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
difference in my opinion we discussed a
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
difference between Podiatry and whether
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
it could be in or should be in the fact
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
of the matter is it has not been in it
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
has been a separate board and we've made
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of changes and let's give people a
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
year at least to work with the oversight
 
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
committee continue to work with oplc and
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
next year we could look at this matter
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
again representa monu you want to speak
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
to your second yeah um we were not able
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
to address I uh 100% agree with the
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative G and also we did not
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
address the fact that number of
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
members shrinking the board increases
 
01:06:24.279 --> 01:06:25.630 align:start position:0%
members shrinking the board increases
the

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility that especially this is
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
Medical Board and this affects the
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
public safety even more and we got to be
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
very careful in how we do that how we
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
Implement that so with that I think
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
giving another year to see how it all
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
works out would be uh very helpful thank
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
you okay um okay so on that point just a
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
procedural thing if we were let's say to
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl if that were to happen
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
that then we could proceed to uh
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
recommend an amendment and uh which you
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
know I I'll give my position so I think
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
that Podiatry is another form of a
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
doctor you know some type of doctor I
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
know the training is different um so I'm
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
going to vote against the itl although
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
not my view isn't super strong on that
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
um but if the itl were to be uh defeated
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
we could then moved to make an amendment
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
which I would suggest to change the uh
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
you know the current membership of the
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
board in that's in the bill so I that's
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
a good point and the same I you know
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
part of the reason I'm
 
01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
not it isn't a strong position is that I
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
think there might be some benefit to
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
doing it it's it's probably not huge and
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
there is still the I think there's less
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
of an issue maybe in these boards um
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
having them settle down from the changes
 
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
we made last year because it sounds like
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
there that's working pretty well there's
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
more of an issue on the boards on the
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
previous Bill and so while I saw and you
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
know so but any other discussion before
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
we take a vote represent of gold well I
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
just would say we did not hear from the
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
podiatrist at this hearing so um I would
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
have been glad to have had them but
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
they're not here I know I know okay I
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
but I have all opposition for this one
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
well I I will say to that because that's
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
been that Point's been made before
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
um well certainly that's something to
 
01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.749 align:start position:0%
um well certainly that's something to
look

01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
at you know if the legislature this is
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
the the regulation be done under the
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
authority of the
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and you know it's our duty
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
to do what we think is best for the
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
people to
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
State and you know there may be you know
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
especially before there was licensing
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
there may have been people who are
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
practicing in the field who might have
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
opposed licensing but that doesn't mean
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
that the legislature shouldn't have done
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
what they did so you you know while
 
01:08:58.349 --> 01:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
that's of Interest I don't it should not
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
be determinative no I I agree I'm just
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
taking it down a totality sure um
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
chair I I think you make a good point I
 
01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
think I'm kind of in the same mindset
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
that you are I wouldn't oppose itl if we
 
01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
all agreed to follow that through on the
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
day we exact the bill however if it
 
01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass I think we should talk now
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
membership I agree we should have a we
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't that we should have an
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that has an acceptable we have
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
this motion on the floor um if
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
it if the it passes and that's our
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the committee there's
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
nothing to keep someone from bringing an
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to the full
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee um and you know argue against
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
itl before the full committee and offer
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:09:55.709 --> 01:09:55.719 align:start position:0%
it have less of a chance than if the
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did but but uh I don't
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
think we can get into discussing that
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
while we've got an itail motion on the
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
table so representative G I'll just sum
 
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
up with uh my husband has observed much
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the proceedings of this body and he

session on House Bill
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
1285 and get organized and then
 
01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh briefly if you'd like very because
 
01:11:08.189 --> 01:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
we are we got a big Bill ahead of us but
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't comment it comment on it
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
in my written uh testimony but there is
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
a bill House Bill 322 specifically
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
looking to study the Board of Medicine
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
um and the Board of Medicine has gone
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
through several audits in the past the
 
01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:31.640 align:start position:0%
most recent one is 2000 is uh 2008 I
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't recall the dates on the other ones
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
butor was house 3:22 322 yes sir okay um
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
so that is something to keep in mind
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
that all right actually that would have
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
been good to know because that would
 
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
have been another reason to to wait
 
01:11:53.229 --> 01:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
until that assuming that bill passes we
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:11:58.270 --> 01:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
no um it's interesting we haven't that
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
must have gone to HHS I suppose
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study in
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee or commer probably I would
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
anyway we we can yeah okay all right
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm going to open the
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on House Bill
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
1271 um I looked I just want to give you
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on how to proceed and see if
 
01:12:28.199 --> 01:12:29.110 align:start position:0%
my thoughts on how to proceed and see if
people

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
agree um this is most of this is
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
converting boards from
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
um the you know to an Advisory Board
 
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
there's one case where it's merging
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
boards um massage therapists and
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
reflexology and um some other things and
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
you know if we were to you know retain
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
even any of this bill we're going to
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
have to get rid of um the section that
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
eliminates the board of registry of
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
medical technicians since we already did
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
that at least we recommended it in uh
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
1410 I think it was um and so I think
 
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do is
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
maybe uh talk a little bit and have some
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
input from oplc although uh Mr ous did
 
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.870 align:start position:0%
input from oplc although uh Mr ous did
send

01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
send
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
in he had emailed initially to some of
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
us and then it was shared with the full
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.950 align:start position:0%
us and then it was shared with the full
committee

01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
um you know their take on actually I
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
printed copies so I'll hand them out
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um one
 
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.189 align:start position:0%
thank you um one
two

01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
three can hand those on on
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh opl C's take on advisory boards and
 
01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to talk about advisory
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
boards in general first and then I'd
 
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that we go through these one at
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
a time these eight of them and um to see
 
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
which ones you know we may make
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
different decisions on different ones
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
and the first one will be acupuncture I
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
think we have a couple people from the
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
AC acupuncture Community here to talk on
 
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
those specifically but
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
um so people can look at that and if you
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
have any questions for anyone from oplc
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
related to the general topic of advisory
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
them and actually uh Mr oo if you could
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
come up and just kind of summarize them
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions because I'm not sure people uh
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
I don't remember when this got emailed
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
to the full board and so I'm not sure if
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
people had a chance to look at
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
it I think it went out Wednesday to the
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
full board okay Douglas ster how oplc
 
01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
general counsel so I put in my email
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
that this was not really something I
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
ever intended to share it was just kind
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
of conversations I was having with board
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
members or members of the public and
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
just kind of jotting down notes for my
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
own benefit um but it sort of goes
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
through if I was going to have a
 
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
conversation and explain to somebody
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
what an Advisory Board was sort of the
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
office's role uh just how I envisioned
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board working within the
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
office and I I hopefully that I mean
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's bullet points just talking points
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
they kind of speak for themselves um but
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
it just touches on like the first bullet
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions around
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts and and how it is
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
our responsibility as Protectors of the
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
public to always rely on subject matter
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
experts Advisory board non-advisory
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
board uh the Sherman Act coverage which
 
01:15:46.270 --> 01:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
I think we have talked about quite a bit
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
in hearings but just that sort of
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
liability on the individual on the state
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
if those Market participants and there
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
is an adequate State oversight
 
01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
um one of the concerns again it has to
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
do with the subject matter experts is
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
does this put too much power in the
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
hands of the executive director can the
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
executive director go and promulgate
 
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
rules without any board input and I I
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
genuinely don't think that's the case
 
01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
because I think in statute we are
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
required to work with the boards to
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules to come up with the
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
right rules and there's also
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities built in the system in 541
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's public hearings there's
 
01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment and if the boards
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
feel they aren't being heard 100%
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to show up at the Jael car
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
and say so I've seen it happen so uh not
 
01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:38.650 align:start position:0%
with this agency by the
 
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:40.510 align:start position:0%
with this agency by the
[Laughter]

01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
way um and then non-advisory to advisory
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's the same kind of thing if you have
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
a well functioning Advisory Board really
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
from the board's perspective you
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
shouldn't see a lot of difference as far
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
as you're still going to show up you're
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
still going to be help drafting rules
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to promulgate rules a lot
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the benefits come though when there's
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
changes that are proposed at the Jael
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
car or they're kind of effective and
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency changes it's more of a lean
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
process bill in my opinion than than
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
anything else is we don't have to wait
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
another month to send a proposal to to
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
the board and have them vote on it we
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
can contact board members we can have
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
the conversations and maybe we can move
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
things along
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then the other one
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
is again from our perspective advisory
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
non-advisory is not in any way a
 
01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.709 align:start position:0%
non-advisory is not in any way a
reflection

01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
reflection
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
on the profession itself a lot of these
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
are legal concerns are efficiency
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
concerns to me it's it's protecting the
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
state it's helping in some cases uh move
 
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
things along just a little bit faster
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of what I I
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
summarized in here um
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
just these are the talking points if I
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
was going to try and put somebody's mind
 
01:17:59.149 --> 01:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
at ease about advisory versus
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
non-advisory one clarifica clarification
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
is uh when you're talking about
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
liability you mention the state you also
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
mention individuals are those the
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
individuals serving on the board correct
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
okay so they're open if there were an
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
antitrust lawsuit are they open to
 
01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
antitrust lawsuit are they open to
individual

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
liability potentially I I mean it's it's
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
a stronger argument for personal
 
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
liability without The Advisory Board
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
place especially in these boards where
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
there's only a handful of people uh in
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
the profession or individuals
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
participating okay any questions for uh
 
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:35.560 align:start position:0%
Brown and then Mt py uh thank you Mr
 
01:18:38.189 --> 01:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
chair I you have to clarify that for me
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
so B all of our boards
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
now how are they covered
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
Summer from as state actors they'd be
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
covering under 99d okay so essentially
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
if you're acting in good faith on behalf
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the state the Attorney General's
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
office is going to come in they'll
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
defend you and more than likely there
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
won't be personal liability and I'm
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
speaking in kind of these I'm doing that
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
attorney thing where it's always a maybe
 
01:19:05.629 --> 01:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
right because I never know what it
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen or the
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
particulars of a case but there's much
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
better Protections in place if you're
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
acting with that state coverage than
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
than when it's not there a followup
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
followup so
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
and so that wouldn't be the case in The
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
Advisory board or am I totally lost
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
do you want to do
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
sorry uh what the what the advisory does
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
is give uh more State oversight and so
 
01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
that just creates a better argument for
 
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
why there should not be personal
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
liability should something happen should
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh the board be sued and ju and just to
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
follow up to that I know on the South
 
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
Carolina case has been talked about was
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
there actual individual liability found
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the board members that I don't know
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
but the issue is really this if the
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
state if the actor is not a member of
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
the profession then it undercuts the
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
argument that there's any antitrust
 
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
issues going on because I'm a lawyer
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
what do I care if the podiatrists have
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
you know if we're limiting competition
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that's really the theory there in the
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
Anti-Trust world is that the final actor
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
is not a member of the
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
profession yeah as I understand it the
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
issue is you have people who are in the
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
profession determining who can be in the
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
profession and how they get uh dealt
 
01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
with if they're accused of something and
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
problematic yeah follow I'm sorry I'm
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
really sorry everybody in the
 
01:20:33.719 --> 01:20:39.629 align:start position:0%
really sorry everybody in the
room

01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
so so for that question is there a
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
difference between an Advisory Board and
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
a board or a board are all of so our
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
boards aren't advisory boards or I'm
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
going totally backwards now we we have
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
seven right now that are advisory and
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
one of them before you right now is
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
massage and
 
01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
reflexology and I have spoken with the
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
massage board Advisory Board and they
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
would like to be
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
merged they think that reflexology Asian
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
Bodywork and structural integration
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
should be part of massage it used to be
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
part of massage I guess there was a
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
separation conflict in the profession
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
years ago but they think they should be
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
back together okay we can get into the
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
details on that when we get down to that
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
one any uh so muchy thank you madam Mr
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
chair I'm seeing uh representative
 
01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:31.550 align:start position:0%
chair I'm seeing uh representative
Maguire

01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
Maguire
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
there um
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
so advisory versus
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
um non licensing uh board legal versus
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
fiary responsibility of individual board
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
can you just tell me a little more about
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
the difference or is there no
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:55.350 align:start position:0%
the difference or is there no
difference

01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
so really the issue is this when we talk
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
about ant when we talk about Market
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
participants making decisions that
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
impact competition in the field the
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
argument is that and this is what the
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court recognized that although
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
they although we because I I have I have
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
multiple hats too um can wear multiple
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
hats you can't truly ever take off your
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
professional hat and that there is an
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
argument to be made um there are
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding antitrust and so with
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
respect to liability and Immunity if you
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
make a decision recklessly in this case
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
if you make a decision to regulate
 
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
imposed requirements to limit
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
competition and you should have known
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
that that was going to happen then
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
technically under 99d you may not be
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
subject you may not be subject or
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
indemnification um and defense so that's
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
the issue but if at the end of the day
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
on an Advisory Board model they make a
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation to a body that is not a
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
member of the profession that really
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
provides them with coverage because they
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
didn't make the
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
decision maybe I can just a moment I
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
think there might be I mean and correct
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong in in stating this so
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
with a regular
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
board uh as far as rulle making on
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
things like you how you get a license or
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
or or other things the board actually
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
does the ru making uh hopefully in with
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
help or staff help or whatever from oplc
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
but they're responsible for doing the ru
 
01:23:32.430 --> 01:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
making and if there's a a complaint they
 
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
actually make the decision on how the
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
complaint's going to be handled but an
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board the ru making is actually
 
01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
done by oplc in consultation with the
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
board but the ultimate responsibility
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
for those rules is
 
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
oplc and similarly for um adjudicated
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
complaints um either it's obvious an
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
oplc can can deal with it or if there's
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
some you need subject matter information
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
either you can get it outside or you
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
could consult with the board but
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately that decision and the
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
adjudication is the responsibility of
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
oplc and that's how you get away from
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
people who are Market you know they're
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
they're working in the field from being
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
put in a position of making decisions
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
that directly affect their peers which
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
could be a problem is that good that's
 
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and I I think my body
 
01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
art microblading example uh that I
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
previously testified to you is a great
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
example of that because had that board
 
01:24:39.950 --> 01:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
not been advisory they would not have
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
moved forward with the rul making based
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
on the pressures they were getting in
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
the industry um and but they had a
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
sagittary obligation to do so and those
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
those reasons were purely based on
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
limiting competition um so that's a
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
prime example so I mean the point is
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
there have been although I don't as far
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
as I know we haven't been sued on it um
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
you can correct me but there have been
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
situations where if we were it could
 
01:25:09.149 --> 01:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
have been you know dicey if nothing else
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
yes we weren't suited on the body art
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
because I said too bad so sad we need to
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
move forward with rul making and we now
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
have rules because they're Advisory
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
board so I was able to step in and make
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
those rules okay thank you um represent
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
M py and Brown
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm trying to follow the um
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
path here so last year legislation did a
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
lot of changes to take the rule making
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
or licensing from the regulatory board
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
to give it to
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
oplc and they are rule making for the
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
profession but not licensing that would
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
uh help with with the profession growth
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
or new licenses the competition if I
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
correctly say you're blind to you know
 
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
when the a new applicant submits an
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
application because it's not a
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
professional U it's not a you know so
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
the oplc is blind in that sense to say
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
what the applicant is just so I see
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
that um did that change change the
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory board's function in terms of
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
making that more an advisory role versus
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory board because that function
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
was removed from the legislation do you
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
know what I'm trying to get out I think
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the changes gave the process
 
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
piece to the oplc but as far as like
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
licensing criteria that would remain
 
01:26:51.229 --> 01:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
with the board and the oplc wouldn't
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
have the authority to force them to rule
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah so in that
 
01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.590 align:start position:0%
that yeah so in that
case

01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
is is it a good balance at this point
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
when the shift is happening to leave it
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
at R regulatory board and automatically
 
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
when that things changes it becomes an
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
advisory mostly an advisory role because
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's not completely transition that's a
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
challenging question I think because
 
01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
you'd have to look at each board in
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
right there's different circumstances
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
for different boards some boards I mean
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
we had a conversation just a few minutes
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
ago Board of Medicine you know their
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
transition to us processing the
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
applications has gone very smoothly
 
01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
where it's been more challenging for
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
other boards
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
so so it's it's sort of a challenging
 
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:48.280 align:start position:0%
answer but but again I also want to
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
point out that a lot of this is for the
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
protection of the State and for the
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
protection of the individual serving on
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
the board and again if it is a well
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
functioning board regardless of whether
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
they have the authority we have the
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
authority we're going to try and have
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
that collaborative experience and and
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
draft good
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
rules I would hang on I would agree with
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
that I would also say that it it
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
certainly limits the risk but to Doug's
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
point you need to look at the actual
 
01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
board to understand the the significance
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
of the risk um Midwifery for example
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
that has on average 30 members uh or
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
lienes and they all know each other I
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
would say that's a pretty high risk
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
which one was that Midwifery okay you
 
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
know other boards if and this is not
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
contemplated but if you had 10,000
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
lenses um and the licenses didn't own
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
businesses but worked in different
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that's probably low risk so I
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
think those are the things that you need
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
to to look at and what I'd like to add
 
01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
something that and again correct me if
 
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong um
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
if if it's a a a regulatory board rather
 
01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.910 align:start position:0%
if if it's a a a regulatory board rather
than

01:28:57.910 --> 01:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
advisory they uh make the rules or they
 
01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
could choose not to make the rules and I
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
think as the example she gave there have
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
been cases where boards maybe didn't
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
entirely agree with what the legislature
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
did in statute and declined to create
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
rules at all and that puts oplc in a a
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
position where they are statuto supposed
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
to do things but they don't have the
 
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
rules to do it but you know
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know the the boards and
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
oplc work well together and a lot of you
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
know some most case I think I hope it
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
works but in the cases where a board
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
chooses not to if their advisory as she
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
had mentioned in the one case that
 
01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
actually happened um oplc can move
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
forward and actually get the rules
 
01:29:43.109 --> 01:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
created that the legislature wanted them
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
to do if that is that good summary yes
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
that's accurate okay thank you so much
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
py yeah so so sorry well quick quick
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
followup and then representative Brown
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
so where does the jel car come into this
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh advisory Regulatory and force not
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
forcing I don't want to use the word
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
forcing uh facilitate or enhance opl C's
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
ability or the legislative mandate to be
 
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
implemented does jel car play a
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
role no so I mean the legislature will
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
say you have an obligation to Draft
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
rules and unless you bring rules forward
 
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
to jail car there's no review so so
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's the challenge representative
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
Brown um thank you Mr chair except that
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
your rules would expire and you would
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
have none potentially 10 years if you're
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
if you're up against expiration then you
 
01:30:41.229 --> 01:30:41.239 align:start position:0%
have to renew if you don't then you have
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
none certainly unless your goal is to
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
not have any rules and not implement the
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
statutory objective right right um
 
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.830 align:start position:0%
statutory objective right right um
so

01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh why would not in this case every
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
board be an Advisory board if we want to
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
provide indemnification for our
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
volunteers I just I think we recognize
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's not practical um in New Hampshire
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
we have a long history of a regulatory
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
framework that has independent
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies we have fully
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
functioning larger boards that meet
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
regularly and I think we can minimize
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
that risk through training um and
 
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
providing staff support but when you
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
have a board that doesn't meet regularly
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
because there's not a lot to do it
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
increases the risk because they're not
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
trained you have to continue to train
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
them um and provide that staff support
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
and then when you have a board that you
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
know is five members of let's say a 100
 
01:31:39.149 --> 01:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
person ly population that also increases
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
the risk I just don't think it's
 
01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
practical thank you okay um anyone else
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
on this uh and this right now I just
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
want to do this first part to make sure
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
people have a real understanding ing of
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
advisory versus regulatory boards and
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
what the issues are so anything else
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
specific to that my just question to or
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the chair
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
or is this
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
sweeping change of everything listing
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
conversion is one siiz fitall kind of
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
approach that might be a little
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
more I mean my difficult my view is that
 
01:32:30.990 --> 01:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
I mean I would support making every
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
board Advisory board but there are
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
people that that have a different
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
view um but I think and you can answer I
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
think these are some of the boards where
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
there might be more issues maybe because
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
there aren't a large number of uh people
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
licensed or for other
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
reasons is that yes I think
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire testified that it
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
was fewer than 500 lenes or 200 with the
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
exception of Massage Therapy but it's
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
already a massage or it's already an
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board okay yeah so that there's
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a sweeping everything
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
there's 57 I think if I remember
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
correctly board seven are advised
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
already this is
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
addressing really eight because we got
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
rid of one um and so and these are the
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
ones where the these concerns about a
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
regulat board are are the biggest so
 
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's not sweeping everything it's
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
ones that have some similar
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
characteristics um maybe this uh can uh
 
01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.430 align:start position:0%
characteristics um maybe this uh can uh
either

01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.950 align:start position:0%
either
uh

01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
oplc can answer off these nine or 10
 
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
boards that are or eight how many
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
voluntarily wants to shift from advisory
 
01:33:53.149 --> 01:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
to I mean regular atory to advisory or
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
advisory to regulatory do you have any
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
idea so I know nursing home
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
administrators is interested because
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
they've had some tough cases lately and
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
they don't like opining or making
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
decisions that impact their peer Group
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
which makes sense because it's such a
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
small field um and massage hasn't
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
questioned whether they should be
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
advisory they are advisory and they are
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
interested in emerging with
 
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.709 align:start position:0%
interested in emerging with
reflexology

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
reflexology
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
follow up so the out of eight three are
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
on their own want to be an advisory well
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't had Direct conversations with
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
G I mean they've only
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
met couple of times in the last year
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
Family mediators just had two meetings
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
but prior to that had not been meeting
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
um and that that board there are some
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
significant challenges because there are
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
about um 50 lenes there and I which one
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
is that a family mediators okay I know
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
Midwifery Council had previously agreed
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
to different language not contained in
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
this bill um I know that they don't like
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
the concept but they did agree to
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
language that that would move them to an
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
advisory model and I'd be happy to
 
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
provide you with that um I think
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
somebody did show up from the
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist board in opposition
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
correct um we had a robust public
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
hearing yeah I I would say
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
that well it would be it's great if the
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
board supports it I wouldn't say that
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
should weigh heavily because there
 
01:35:32.669 --> 01:35:32.679 align:start position:0%
are I mean that even asking the board in
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
one sense puts them in difficult
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
position so the question is you have
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
people who work in the field regulatory
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
regulating their
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
peers and if you ask them and they say
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
now we want to stay a regulatory board
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
you're kind of no I'm not asking for
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
asking them but I said if on their own
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
they have said you know it would be a
 
01:35:57.390 --> 01:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
much better functioning for our
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
profession there is an inclination to
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
cooperate rather than forcing something
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
and it's all a volunteer one so instead
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
of getting that you know if there is a
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
Buy in already and they're coming up
 
01:36:11.639 --> 01:36:12.709 align:start position:0%
Buy in already and they're coming up
with

01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
that I I understand that my only thing
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'd say is there have been cases and
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's a particular case that I think
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
we dealt with prior to this year um
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
where the board was not creating the
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
rules that statute told them to and in
 
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
that case CH moving them to advisory is
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
not something I would be asking them so
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
that's all and I'm and I hope this is
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
rare and most of the boards are are
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
working well with LC uh representative
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not I've really cut your pay now
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
because I don't think she's going to let
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
you serve here and and still work
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
there uh this just just kind of
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but it's it's it's also
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
tangentially uh related but I've also
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
had members of the public um both with
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
boards that have gone advisory in the
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
past and I don't want to specify which
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
one but one of the ones on this list
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
where members of the public have come
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
forward and said they appreciated the
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
board goinging advisory because the
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
board had not been responsive to the
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
members of the public whereas the LLC
 
01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
was was able to do that so I also just
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
want to put that on the table uh even if
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
the board may not be we have heard cases
 
01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
where where the public appreciates
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
it um well let me get somebody else U
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative Brown um I have two
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chair maybe you could
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
clarify what director Courtney said or
 
01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
she she can um the decision to go to
 
01:37:42.750 --> 01:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
advisory was less than 500 lenses or was
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
I not hearing maybe it was 300 I don't
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
remember 200 yes it was 200
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh corrected me
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
thankfully it was 200 thank you so and
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
follow up second question yeah looking
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
at page 44 and
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
45 my quick count which could be not
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
quite accurate but I'm showing there
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
will be 11 advisory boards and
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 44 other boards does that
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
sound about right that sounds right
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay um if there 14
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
advisory well you'd be merging massage
 
01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.270 align:start position:0%
advisory well you'd be merging massage
and

01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
reflexology okay we're about about the
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
same yeah
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay I would like to move on from this I
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
mean it's uh it's about 20 of noon would
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
you like a motion Mr chair uh no I'm not
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
looking for a motion just a moment we're
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
going to get to acupuncturist in a
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
minute um this
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't I mean unless somebody wants to
 
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
make an itl on the whole bill which I
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
would not like to get um but um this was
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
just these all you know all but a couple
 
01:38:48.430 --> 01:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
of these deal with moving from a
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
statutory to an Advisory board so I
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
thought it would be useful
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
to have that discussion up front instead
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
of for each one of them so I'm not
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
looking for motion oh uh my motion would
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
be OTP but if you're not ready for that
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually I'll be glad to take OTP sure I
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
move I move OTP on House
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 1271 hang on uh you have a point
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually we actually have to have an
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I was just gonna say was
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
number nine okay I I would um if you
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
want to go that route you need to
 
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh it needs to be with an amendment that
 
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
eliminates the section in here dealing
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
with the board of registration medical
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
technicians because in House Bill 1410
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
we already got rid of them but but you
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
can make that motion we don't we don't
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
have to have the amendment drafted today
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
I mean if if you
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
know make a motion with an amendment
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
actually why don't you make a motion
 
01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:42.639 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to that effect first
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
because we're going to need it anyway
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then we'll move to otpa if that's
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
what you want to okay I move that we
 
01:39:53.229 --> 01:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
1271 to eliminate the section you just
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned okay that's uh section 83 of
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
the bill registration medical Tech right
 
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's page 39 line 7 through 44 line 11
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
or 7 to 11 and uh which is it's a
 
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
multiple sections in there but but
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's okay great um uh I'll second it
 
01:40:19.629 --> 01:40:19.639 align:start position:0%
that was hanging a moment that school
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr chair yep would that also
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
89 right there's uh the the list would
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
also have to be amended the definition
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
of board that's that's all of the
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
medical I think that's all of the
 
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
medical technicians isn't it I was just
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
um well
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually there is a yeah there's
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
a so line 89 Page 44 11 on 44 certainly
 
01:40:47.679 --> 01:40:49.270 align:start position:0%
a so line 89 Page 44 11 on 44 certainly
line

01:40:49.270 --> 01:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
10 right I think I think I said through
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
Page um
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
40 through Page 44 line 11 through that
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
so that is included
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes um someone seconding this I actually
 
01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
I said I would yeah I can't support it
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
sorry well now this
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
amendment if we do anything other but a
 
01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:15.950 align:start position:0%
amendment if we do anything other but a
final

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
itl this is sort of like we have to
 
01:41:23.589 --> 01:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
because we we past 1410 yeah and so
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
it'll take it out of here now if let's
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
say the full
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
house uh does itl is
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
1410 then that's fine U because medical
 
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
technicians won't be taken out by that
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
bill and if we do pass some version of
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
this they won't be taken out by this if
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
we adopt the amendment so I I don't see
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
what your concern is about adopting this
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that's not just medical
 
01:41:50.669 --> 01:41:50.679 align:start position:0%
technician with this one it's also uh
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
God gosh where is that one line I'm
 
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
trying to look at um if it concludes
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
something more than medical technicians
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
then did oh gosh page and line yeah I
 
01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:03.430 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.430 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking
[Music]

01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
at oh
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
shoot the Imaging P Imaging that is uh
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
hang on uh imaging
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
radiology page 44 line 25 I was only I
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
was only removing through line 11 on 44
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
no I understand we're talking about the
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment oh do you want to no no I'm
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
not saying amend remove but we are just
 
01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
doing peace meal of amendment there are
 
01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
others that are in the bill so what line
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
page and line are you concerned
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
about page 44 we removed it in 14 what
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
line I need a line uh 25 but I have to
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
see corresponding we remove no in 1410
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
we removed the bill leaving it in
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
statute correct and this will change it
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
into advisory oh I see your point yeah
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so there is a conflict what we
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
removed in
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
1410 okay that is now is there that's
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
interest in the sections up front yep if
 
01:43:15.350 --> 01:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
I may if you're talking about medical
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
imaging they're already advisory oh okay
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
so not an issue so that I mean it
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be here well no this
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
this is this is um saying replace all of
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
that section the whole list with a new
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
list no I understand but it says repeat
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
if you see page 44 yep okay it's it's
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
all why is it double then it's already
 
01:43:43.709 --> 01:43:43.719 align:start position:0%
in if it's an Advisory Board why it
 
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
should say online 13 12 and 13 of that
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
page it says that RSA is repealed and
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
reenacted Ed to read as follows so
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
instead of making individual line edits
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
they just replaced the whole thing and
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
so this includes the changes makes them
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
Advisory board but the boards that
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
already existed are still in here with
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
the same status as they were before and
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
since medical imagy and radiation
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
therapy now are advisory they're listed
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
here also as
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
advisory I mean that's just the way not
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
making it it it's maybe my brain is yeah
 
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
you can explain it better I think uh
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
representative that when you look in the
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
existing law the line are says the exact
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
same thing Advisory Board of Medical
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
Imaging and radiation
 
01:44:36.910 --> 01:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
therapy so what they've done because
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
there's so many changes to this list we
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
wiped out the whole the whole list in
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
the RSA and just replace it with a new
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
list to make it easier I think overall
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
rather than repealing and reenacting all
 
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
the individual items does that make
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
sense I I get it but this is making a
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
sweeping change saying every board is an
 
01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
Advisory board so no it's not first of
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
all there's a lot of here that are not
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and and so the thing is
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is just dealing with uh
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
the medical technicians now if we move
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
for and it's not saying you know if we
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
move forward and the committee were to
 
01:45:13.679 --> 01:45:14.830 align:start position:0%
move forward and the committee were to
vote

01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
otpa um or and the and the full you know
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
the house did and everything else then
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
it would it would make changes for you
 
01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
know for the eight remaining actually
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
only seven would become advisory boards
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
because one already is but we're not
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
deciding that right now so because we we
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
could decide you know working in the
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee further let's say we want
 
01:45:38.950 --> 01:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
to keep we want to actually move some to
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
advisory boards and not others as part
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
of that you know add-on Amendment uh we
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
would need to make changes in this list
 
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that's fine so saying that we're
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
doing this this isn't like a final
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment this is like we did with 1410
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
we we agreed to pieces and then all the
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
pieces got merged together in one
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
amendment I like that approach where
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
1410 we did it bits and pieces then and
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
we're doing the same thing here in my
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
and not not making a motion to out of
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
pass at this point we did sections and
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
then we met again
 
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
that's may I yeah
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
so it's in the existing law that line
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
your mentioning is exactly the same
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
words so what this list has done
 
01:46:26.830 --> 01:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
everything that we're suggesting to be
 
01:46:29.589 --> 01:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
changed within the body of the law is
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
changed in that list everything we
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
haven't changed Remains the Same it was
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
just easier to make a whole new list
 
01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:37.719 align:start position:0%
than doing individual line item changes
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
so voting in support of this amendment
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
does not commit
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
anyone to either otpa or to not making
 
01:46:48.430 --> 01:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
other changes it's just I think this is
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
necessary because when this this goes
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
into effect it can't repeal that section
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
because the section will be gone or
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be conflicts between the two
 
01:47:02.109 --> 01:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
bills but it's kind of you know it's a
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's not even housekeeping it's it's
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
just to it's not sweeping changes or
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
well this amendment does not in itself
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
say whether or not we're going to make
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
sweeping changes all it says is if we I
 
01:47:18.589 --> 01:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
mean I would hope everybody would vote
 
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
for this amendment now that doesn't mean
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
you need to vote for otpa which would be
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
the next motion but if we do anything
 
01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
with this bill other than itl which may
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
be what we do but then we should vote to
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
adopt that we to recommend this
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
amendment now if in the end the
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee votes it on the whole bill
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to recommend an
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean this isn't some binding
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
thing okay more followup yes so the if I
 
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
may thank you Mr chair sorry to jump in
 
01:47:48.589 --> 01:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative manag py so the
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
only changes that would would be
 
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
made are the ones that are before the
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
list so the specific sections are the
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
only boards that would be
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
changed this list is not a is not a
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
massive change so everything that has
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
been changed in here will end up in the
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
list things that haven't been changed in
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
here are the same in the list as they
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
are in the current law so the list is
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
not an overall massive change I I
 
01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
understand uh representative uh Brown
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying some of it when
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
I'm looking through 46 pages of this
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
bill there are so many lines crossed off
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
and then my my what I'm planning on
 
01:48:33.149 --> 01:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
doing with this I mean if we if we
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
decide otpa which I'm fine with but some
 
01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
people may not then um then yeah we
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
won't look through all the rest of the
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
bill in detail if we don't do that then
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
my intent would be to go through Section
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
by section as we did with 1410 and talk
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
about whether it makes sense to do a
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
move to advisory for any one of them and
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
then if we decide to move individual
 
01:48:59.070 --> 01:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
ones to advisory then we can look at the
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
language and say is there anything in
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
here that need that isn't okay and we
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
need to change I mean that's that's the
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
idea okay yeah right represent gou
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
procedural question certain so right now
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a specific amendment
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
to clean up the language in this bill to
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
match correct what we've all agreed on
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
recently as a subcommittee regarding the
 
01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.109 align:start position:0%
recently as a subcommittee regarding the
medical

01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:49:21.119 --> 01:49:22.430 align:start position:0%
medical
um

01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
technicians then once we decide on that
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment we can have the
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
otpa um discussion if somebody makes the
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
motion we can have a discussion on that
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
that could include anybody bringing up
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
any concerns they have with the language
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
and or before the amendment either way
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
my request would be that we we ask
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
people to bring their um objections to
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
any part of the bill forward rather
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
than go through it piece by piece where
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's no objection the the only issue
 
01:49:59.070 --> 01:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
and I'd be wonderfully happy with an
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
otpa out of the committee um the
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
only issue I have is if
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
we um if we do otpa if that motion if
 
01:50:12.750 --> 01:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
that well can we take a vote on the
 
01:50:14.830 --> 01:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
amendment first before we get to a
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
motion we don't have yet okay um all in
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
favor of amending to remove those lines
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
I mentioned about medical technician all
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
I all right I anyone
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
opposed no with just the technical right
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
okay so we're we've gotten that and then
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'm open to another
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
motion and so that's my procedural
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
question do should I make should we make
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
the motion and have the discussion where
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
people bring up any objections or do we
 
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to have the discussion and then
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
make the I would suggest um the problem
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
here's the deal and this is me trying to
 
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
be to not take advantage of the fact
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we're three to2 on this committee
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know I don't presume how
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to vote but um if we if
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
we you make the motion I'll be glad to
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
Second it we take a vote it ends up you
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
know I don't know could be 5 to nothing
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it's four to one or or 3 to2 or
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
whatever if the motion passes then we're
 
01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
done okay which I'd be glad it's get
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
lunchtime but to be fair if you're
 
01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.750 align:start position:0%
lunchtime but to be fair if you're
intent

01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
is to then go over parts of the bill I
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
would suggest you not make the motion at
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
this time thank you Mr chair I would
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
like to hear what objections are I don't
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
want to review what we all agree on then
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
what then what I would s what I would
 
01:51:35.709 --> 01:51:35.719 align:start position:0%
like to do and people can tell me if
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
they don't like it because there's
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
likely to be other than the the whole
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
thing on whether or not we want to make
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
anything advisory which I hope you know
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
we we talked about what I would like to
 
01:51:50.430 --> 01:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
do is go through a board by board
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're in here now we may you know we
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
may not we may decide partway through we
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to go through the rest but um
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
so I would uh okay is that okay because
 
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know how we do it randomly
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
moving around but people have issues
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
with particular language that correct is
 
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
it is it at this procedurally uh is it
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
at subcommittee level that we say we
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
have interim study or um
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
but or is it at the board level here's
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
what would happen um we could go through
 
01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
like we did on 1410 section by section
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
and we could take you know not a final
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
vote vote on what we want to do with
 
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:35.229 align:start position:0%
vote vote on what we want to do with
each

01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
each
 
01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
section um and then in the
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
end um once we've gone through it we
 
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
would need to take you know we somebody
 
01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
can make a motion ought to pass with an
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that makes up all the the
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
change es that we voted on including the
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
one we just did and like 1410 and then
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
we would recommend that the commit the
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would recommend that and
 
01:53:00.550 --> 01:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
then I'd go to OLS and get it drafted as
 
01:53:02.189 --> 01:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
I did with the other one and then to the
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
full committee we would we would as a
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommend that that
 
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that Consolidated all the
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
changes we wanted and then recommend
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with that Amendment if you
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
wanted we we can't I don't think interim
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
study parts of this it the whole bill is
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to either be otpa is now we have
 
01:53:26.430 --> 01:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
an amend otpa um itl or interim study on
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
the whole bill uh but if there's things
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
in here which we don't think are ready
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
for prime time we could remove them from
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
the bill they wouldn't be separate
 
01:53:36.990 --> 01:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
interim study but there's nothing that
 
01:53:38.709 --> 01:53:38.719 align:start position:0%
says the committee can't study them or
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
people can't study them without an
 
01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:40.830 align:start position:0%
people can't study them without an
interim

01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
interim
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
study that's clear yeah I um my for
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
clarification Mr chair um this is my
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
first time on this I mean this committee
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh so if you know I'm not looking at the
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
1410 how we did that that was a good
 
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
process same with
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
1676 where we did a lot of work and you
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
know you brought in a one you know
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment sure that full committee had
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to discuss and dialogue
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where I'm thinking our work
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be done at the subcommittee
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
level to do that work and bring it to
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
the full that's what I'm proposing okay
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know I'm proposing that we go
 
01:54:31.629 --> 01:54:31.639 align:start position:0%
through the and we dealt with uh the
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
part nine a list on the front page in
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
the analysis because that one we had to
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
do that way I mean we don't have a
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
choice I don't think unless we want to
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
create two bills that are in
 
01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
Conflict um and then and we had the
 
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
general discussion on advisory and what
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like like to do now if we're you
 
01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
know unless everybody's agreed on otpa
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
um which I don't think they are I'd like
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
to move forward um because I mean you
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
know if we took an otpa motion here and
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
let's say it turn three to two and then
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
we'd be done and then we'd end up having
 
01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:07.159 align:start position:0%
this this discussion the full committee
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
which is not useful no so okay all right
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
so can we proceed all right um I know
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
two people are here on acupuncture I'm
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
sorry I recognize uh the lady with the
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
badge um what do you what is your with
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
for so you work with the
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
boards okay and okay great thank you
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes she sits with them yeah I knew
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure I
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
knew no that's fine that's fine um all
 
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.870 align:start position:0%
knew no that's fine that's fine um all
right

01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
so I didn't turn my mic on for that
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's probably good uh no it's all
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
right mine's on you probably CR it um
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay so taking a quick look at um and if
 
01:55:59.109 --> 01:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
people need a break why don't we take a
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
five minute break or so all right all
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
right we're going to recess for five
 
01:56:06.589 --> 01:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
minutes or so five minute
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay a little longer yeah I'm just
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
looking I'll have to check my see how it
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
is why don't 10 10 minutes help check
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
here I'm fine well we'll take a a a
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
10minute we'll recess for 10 minutes
 
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
yeah because I again I'm in the
 
01:56:24.669 --> 01:56:24.679 align:start position:0%
same thing I was last Friday I have to
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
work tonight so I gotta be out when do
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:32.360 align:start position:0%
leave 2:40 absolutely okay 2:30 would be
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
more comfortable all right so 2:30 we
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%

01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
get through I have a parking meter
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%

01:57:18.400 --> 02:09:38.229 align:start position:0%

1271 and I'd like to deal with um if you
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
look at the analysis uh the first part
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
which converts the board of acupuncture
 
02:09:54.270 --> 02:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
licensing into an Advisory Board and
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
make other amendments implementing this
 
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
change and um that's on page one line
 
02:10:04.030 --> 02:10:04.040 align:start position:0%

bill page page one line one the
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
beginning through Page Six line
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%

acupuncture
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
stuff okay and um I know we have some
 
02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:28.599 align:start position:0%

02:10:59.709 --> 02:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh and I'm Tracy branstrom
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a PhD candidate at the University of
 
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:04.520 align:start position:0%

England mainly in New Hampshire and
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
Vermont um and that's how I learned
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
about uh ACU detox or ER acupuncture
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%

02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
m okay thank you and I'm a certified ACU
 
02:11:27.629 --> 02:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
detox Specialist or ads in New Hampshire
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm here okay thank
 
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
you so I just want to provide a few
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
comments hopefully it will help you if
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
you're not still not certain about where
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
to stand on this um the question that
 
02:11:40.830 --> 02:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
was asked during the Committee hearing
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
was what would change if HB um 1271
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
becomes law so I have two points um
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
first is currently the acupuncture board
 
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any acupuncture
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
detoxification Specialists um they're a
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
lower tier of
 
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
certification and it's important that
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
they have representation and I can point
 
02:12:02.790 --> 02:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
to an example that came up this week
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
since that hearing um the acupuncture
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
board approved rules that will go to the
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
Jael car next month pertaining to lure
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
by endorsement and the rules that the
 
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
acupuncture board approved for
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
pertaining to acupuncture detoxification
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
specialist conflict with the law and I
 
02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
happened to see them as a fluke so I
 
02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
contacted oplc myself and showed them
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
what the statutes are but if they had an
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
Acu detox specialist on the board
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
looking after those other people who are
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
certified as adss that might not have
 
02:12:40.830 --> 02:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
happened um so that brings me to my
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
second point which is acupuncturists
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
know acupuncture but we don't know
 
02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:49.109 align:start position:0%
know acupuncture but we don't know
regulation

02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
um executive director Lindsay brought up
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court case about the North
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
Carolina dentist versus the tooth
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
whiteners that's the is that the Sherman
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
Act oh okay um so after that precedent
 
02:13:03.629 --> 02:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
was sent was set the North Carolina
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
acupuncture board lost a countersuit to
 
02:13:08.589 --> 02:13:08.599 align:start position:0%
the physical therapy board for
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive behavior um I got my
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
first licensed a practice in North
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
Carolina and um in 2020 I guess I was
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
still on their email list so I got an
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
email asking if I personally wanted to
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
chip in to help them cover $60,000 in
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
legal expenses and that was reduced from
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
180,000 and just out of curiosity
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
earlier this week I went on an
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
acupuncture group on Facebook and I just
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
said hey does anyone know if the North
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
Carolina acupuncture board was able to
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
pay off their legal expenses from being
 
02:13:47.310 --> 02:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
counter sued by the physical therapists
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
and one person spoke up and he said that
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
he was on the board at the time that it
 
02:13:55.549 --> 02:13:55.559 align:start position:0%
was the 180,000 and that each individual
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
member of the board was personally sued
 
02:13:57.719 --> 02:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
member of the board was personally sued
$5

02:13:58.870 --> 02:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
$5
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
million do would you like screenshots I
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
didn't think to bring
 
02:14:06.189 --> 02:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
them okay okay
 
02:14:06.199 --> 02:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
them okay okay
um

02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
so so um this again we talked about how
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
this would protect the boards um but not
 
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
only that it would protect individual
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
practitioners like me I can approach I
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
would think that I could approach an
 
02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:22.559 align:start position:0%
Advisory board that has stronger legal
 
02:14:25.950 --> 02:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
counsel from oplc to talk about ways in
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
which I think our law and our
 
02:14:32.350 --> 02:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
rules are
 
02:14:34.589 --> 02:14:34.599 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive and then if changes
 
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
need if it's determined that changes
 
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
need to be made we can move forward
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
together because everyone and then
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
everyone because everyone's on the same
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
page and that would
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
save your committee a lot of referee
 
02:14:50.669 --> 02:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
between us which has been happening for
 
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
some time now so does that make sense if
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
I could just ask a clarification on that
 
02:14:59.709 --> 02:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
um so is it that you could more easily
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
approach an Advisory Board because the
 
02:15:05.229 --> 02:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
regulat the regulatory board has more
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
direct control over you making a living
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
and if they have an issue with you you
 
02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
might have concerns um I don't know if
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's is that's what I heard I don't
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
know if that's what you intended I meant
 
02:15:20.430 --> 02:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
that if so with oplc had more direct
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
control over an Advisory Board guiding
 
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
them on how to create laws that are not
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive I would feel more
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable going and speaking directly
 
02:15:32.189 --> 02:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
does that is it because you think it's
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
more likely they would actually do
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
something at least in the direction you
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
want it or or why would it make a
 
02:15:40.510 --> 02:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
difference I think that it would be
 
02:15:43.350 --> 02:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
helpful to have the mediation to help us
 
02:15:45.950 --> 02:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
navigate difficult conversations and
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
then what if I'm wrong then there would
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
be an attorney present to say that's
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
really not something to be concerned
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
about or they might say yeah actually we
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
could take a look at that okay thank you
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
if you have anything else to say or you
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's all I have okay any questions for
 
02:16:02.310 --> 02:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
her from the committee representative
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
maputi thank you uh Mr chair thank you
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so currently help
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
me understand currently the occup cural
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
licensing board is a regulatory board
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
and you would like to see The Advisory
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
convert that into Advisory board for two
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
reasons one is the regulation rule
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
making would be lot more friendlier not
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
non-competitive we're a small profession
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
and we don't get along
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
well okay uh and director Courtney just
 
02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
quick um how many licensed AC licensed
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
by the acupuncher board just briefly
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'll have you up here in a bit but I
 
02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:48.389 align:start position:0%
I'll have you up here in a bit but I
think

02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay so it's so it's under 200 it's
 
02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:51.669 align:start position:0%
okay so it's so it's under 200 it's
under

02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
the okay so the okay car follow the
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
second point is the Sherman versus North
 
02:17:06.429 --> 02:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
Carolina act proved that there is fidu
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
uh Financial liability on the board on
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
the part of the board members if they
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
are regulatory board versus Advisory
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
Board that's your understanding that
 
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding okay can I ask
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
for a clarification with the I'm going
 
02:17:24.669 --> 02:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
to have director Courtney but if you
 
02:17:26.669 --> 02:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
have something brief that she could come
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
up now that's no go go from who from the
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
from Doug and attorney and Court uh when
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
they come next I'll have them up I was
 
02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:40.359 align:start position:0%
going to let the the these two uh people
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
speak and answer any questions that are
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
specific to them and then we'll have the
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
oplc FKS up all right so you're done um
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute you have a question
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
Rob yeah I do than you Mr representative
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
Brown could you just explain a little
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
bit more what you said about the
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
detoxification specialist there wasn't
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
one on the board now which currently
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
there is no ads ACU detox specialist on
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
the board but the acupuncture board is
 
02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
made up of four acupuncturist and one
 
02:18:16.750 --> 02:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
public member so there's no ACU detox
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
specialist currently
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
like right now the the law and maybe the
 
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
rules State it's for acupuncturist and a
 
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
public member now now is an AC just a
 
02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
moment clarification is an acud detox
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
specialist considered an acupuncturist
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
so could they be on the
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
board they could probably fill the role
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
of a public member if they were asked to
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
me as one of the acupuncturist members I
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe so director Courtney
 
02:18:48.990 --> 02:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
shaking her head so okay thank you sorry
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's okay so you said something
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
about and I wasn't writing fast enough
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
the board approved rules for acupuncture
 
02:18:57.240 --> 02:18:58.549 align:start position:0%
the board approved rules for acupuncture
detox

02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
detox
 
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
specialist but you didn't the board
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
didn't have one on there to help them
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
put those together is that was that your
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
correct okay um uh Miss branstrom if I'm
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
pronouncing that correctly yes yeah
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's right uh I just want to Second
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
the piece about
 
02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.830 align:start position:0%
the piece about
excuse

02:19:19.830 --> 02:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
me getting over a cold um second the
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
piece about the importance of having an
 
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
ads on the board um and having
 
02:19:29.110 --> 02:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
representation for ads is in New
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the I I have been doing
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
I've been certified and uh volunteering
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
as an ads since 2018 um it's a totally
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
different kind of unique genre of
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
acupuncture um uh we serve different
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
popul there's so many differences uh an
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
ads is doing more something that's more
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
akin to Street Outreach in a way you
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
know last year I set up a an ear
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
acupuncture clinic on the State House
 
02:19:58.630 --> 02:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
lawn here for Recovery day um it's just
 
02:20:02.349 --> 02:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
we serve different populations um uh
 
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
people who will go and see a licensed
 
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist cannot necessarily afford
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
or sorry vice versa people who will come
 
02:20:11.070 --> 02:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
to get the notada protocol or ear
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
acupuncture cannot afford to see a
 
02:20:15.389 --> 02:20:15.399 align:start position:0%
license so there's just so many
 
02:20:17.870 --> 02:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
differences um different
 
02:20:20.349 --> 02:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
interests uh historically licensed
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists have been very opposed to
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
allowing uh people like myself to be out
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
on the street doing the simple ear
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
protocol um so there's conflict there
 
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
and it yeah I I just want to stress the
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
importance of having representation on a
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the form the board may take any
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions from Miss branstrom represent
 
02:20:45.150 --> 02:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
mapy um how recent is the specialty in
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
occupant occupant itself is an evolving
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
field and how recent is this uh specific
 
02:20:57.309 --> 02:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
year detox uh occupant field it goes
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
back to the early 70s but I'll yeah yeah
 
02:21:03.070 --> 02:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
it has yeah it's been going on for
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
decades in the US um and globally uh I
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
think 1974 was when in the Bronx in New
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
York City it was um kind of like uh
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
popularized as a movement um and then
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
the national ACC acupunctured
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
detoxification Association or NADA was
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
formed in the what the early 80s um so
 
02:21:26.750 --> 02:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
it has a it has a robust history in the
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
US do you want to add I mean I would add
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have the certification of
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
acupuncture detoxification Specialists
 
02:21:35.710 --> 02:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire until
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
2017 um but in some cases like if you
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
look at New York state New York City
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
where it was pioneered it was before
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
there were acupuncture laws and um when
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
acup when acupuncture statutes were
 
02:21:53.790 --> 02:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
passed in the state of New York they did
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
it sort of acupuncturist came together
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
to wipe out the acupuncture
 
02:21:59.469 --> 02:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
detoxification Specialists and get them
 
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
out of practice so there is a bit of a
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
contentious history there okay uh thank
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
gold thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is there anything
 
02:22:14.230 --> 02:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
in the way the current bill is this
 
02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
current bill is written that you feel
 
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed at the moment no
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown thank you
 
02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Brown thank you
Mr

02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
chair uh it in the law now the board
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
consists of four
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists and one public member we
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't have a public member in suggested
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
in this legislation which would be right
 
02:22:41.230 --> 02:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
in there right so on pay for everyone
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
for page one line 15 through 19 is the
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
makeup of the board
 
02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:48.670 align:start position:0%
makeup of the board
is

02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
there I I guess I'll ask you folks since
 
02:22:53.469 --> 02:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
you're sitting there do you are we
 
02:22:54.750 --> 02:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
missing a public member is that
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
something we need to do and then maybe
 
02:23:00.110 --> 02:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
the chair knows why that
 
02:23:02.309 --> 02:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
happened from what I understand
 
02:23:05.030 --> 02:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
listening to other hearings um oplc have
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's hard to find public
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
members yeah thank you okay any other
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions that represent to follow up
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Brown
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
that typically you have three
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
members and if it is executive director
 
02:23:27.230 --> 02:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
they have three members um and one of
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
which is to be an acupuncture
 
02:23:33.309 --> 02:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
detoxification specialist current I mean
 
02:23:35.309 --> 02:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
that's proposed the bill do you know I'm
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
going to ask director Courtney but do
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know off hand the current board
 
02:23:39.469 --> 02:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
membership it's right here oh it's what
 
02:23:39.479 --> 02:23:40.389 align:start position:0%
membership it's right here oh it's what
four

02:23:40.389 --> 02:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
four
 
02:23:43.469 --> 02:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists excuse me four
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists and one public member
 
02:23:47.710 --> 02:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so in this sorry to follow up uh uh
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
so it's reducing from five to three
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
member board as an advisory
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
right um do you have any opinion on that
 
02:24:04.389 --> 02:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you okay if uh nothing
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
else for for these uh ladies I'd like to
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
have uh the oplc folks up to answer any
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know provide some information answer
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
any questions and thank you both for
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
waiting oh yeah thank
 
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.870 align:start position:0%
waiting oh yeah thank
you

02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:24:19.150 --> 02:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time out of
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
your day to be here I know they had to
 
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
ones okay so
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
um where to start I guess have you been
 
02:24:34.269 --> 02:24:34.279 align:start position:0%
able to find the the P a public member
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
for this board is one question yes they
 
02:24:39.269 --> 02:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
do have a longstanding public member um
 
02:24:41.150 --> 02:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
typically The Advisory boards don't have
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
public members the theory being that
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
oplc can basically serve in that
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
function because they're not part of the
 
02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:49.510 align:start position:0%
function because they're not part of the
board

02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
but you could certainly add a public
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
member um we don't take a position on
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
that I assume that if we were to add a
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
public member since you tend to like odd
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
numbers on the boards you'd want us to
 
02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
add somebody else too correct five yeah
 
02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
yeah five total okay um represent M py
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
um so to oplc thank you Mr chair uh for
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
oplc this has been an Advisory Board
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
from no
 
02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
sorry occup puncture board has been an
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board no it's not the purpose
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
of this one of the the main purpose of
 
02:25:27.389 --> 02:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
this section of the bill is to make it
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board it's currently
 
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
statutory so let me repas a question
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
then so it's been a statutory board for
 
02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:38.990 align:start position:0%
then so it's been a statutory board for
how

02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
long I'd have to go back into the
 
02:25:45.070 --> 02:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
rsas um I don't know off the top of my
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
head I can find that answer for you I
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
think one of the if my memory serves me
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
correct it was one of the first
 
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
alternative therapies that were board
 
02:25:59.710 --> 02:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
licensed or board certified in New
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire occup puncture was one of the
 
02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
ones so
 
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
1997 correct okay effect yeah effective
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah 20 1997 so one more followup Mr
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
chair yes so the detox acupuncture
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
didn't start until much later or once we
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
had unfortunately became the number two
 
02:26:29.950 --> 02:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
overdose state in the country right I'm
 
02:26:33.389 --> 02:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
looking at RSA 328 g9a and looks like
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
that statute originated in 2017 correct
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
so this is much more recent in terms of
 
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
okay all right just to follow up on that
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
so before that was that acupuncture
 
02:26:50.110 --> 02:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
licensed at all or regulated yes so it
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
looks like acupuncturist have been
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
licensed since 1997 or 1998 right and
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
they added under the acupuncture board
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
um the acupuncture detox specialist in
 
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
2017 some states have put them in other
 
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
under other boards namely uh lak or
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug use professionals
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
boards but it looks like we put them
 
02:27:13.630 --> 02:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
under acupuncture and just follow so
 
02:27:17.150 --> 02:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
prior to 2177 2017 would it have been
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
legal or illegal for someone to practice
 
02:27:22.030 --> 02:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
the acupuncture detox that I don't know
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
I think the question would depend on
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not what they were doing was
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
considered acupuncture that's that's the
 
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
question so okay thank
 
02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:32.429 align:start position:0%
question so okay thank
you

02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
um all
 
02:27:37.349 --> 02:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
right so the other thing then I don't
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
see any other questions related what
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
we've done so far and I guess other than
 
02:27:44.750 --> 02:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to the the the this section of the
 
02:27:47.550 --> 02:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
bill other than the changes to the board
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
membership and the changes that were
 
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to change it from being a uh a
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
statutory to Advisory Board what if any
 
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
other changes are in here I haven't had
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
a chance to take a really detailed look
 
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
so I have a question for well I'd like
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
to get an answer to
 
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
this no no just no no I'm referring just
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
to the section on acupuncture so it
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
removes um statutory authority to Esta
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
rules for temporary lure of a visiting
 
02:28:21.550 --> 02:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
acupuncture teacher yeah to my knowledge
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
we've never issued such a license and
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
those people would could be licensed
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
under the PLC 313 so it's not
 
02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:33.670 align:start position:0%
under the PLC 313 so it's not
necessary

02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's why I'm looking to see
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
are we doing anything other than making
 
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
advisory and changing the board
 
02:28:43.230 --> 02:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
membership no there's some cleanup
 
02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
language that is intended to address
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
some of the legis ative changes we've
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
this body has made
 
02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
previously um
 
02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:57.469 align:start position:0%
previously um
but

02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
no yes so so there's some cleanup
 
02:29:02.349 --> 02:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
language related to the investigative
 
02:29:05.469 --> 02:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
changes from last year right
 
02:29:05.479 --> 02:29:07.349 align:start position:0%
changes from last year right
okay

02:29:07.349 --> 02:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
right yeah um page
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
22 uh it says instead of the board
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
executive director approved professional
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
trained in acq
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
25 strike um board is struck out and is
 
02:29:40.590 --> 02:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
the uh Ru making Authority shifting from
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
occupant board that's what an Advisory
 
02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.429 align:start position:0%
occupant board that's what an Advisory
Board

02:29:44.429 --> 02:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
Board
 
02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
means it the rule Mak
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
actual room making Authority let me find
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
that section um is with the oplc
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
director is with the oplc um in in
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with the board but but the
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
actual Authority is with the oplc and
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
that related to the problem that we had
 
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
in the past that she mentioned where um
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
the board was required by Statute to
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
create certain rules and they refused to
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
do so um oplc was because they were
 
02:30:15.269 --> 02:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
advisory oplc was able to create the
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
rules that stat required whereas if
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
there were statutory board um that would
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
not have been possible unless so I have
 
02:30:26.590 --> 02:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
one question regarding that Mr chair if
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
you can indulge me in sure yeah one of
 
02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:31.790 align:start position:0%
you can indulge me in sure yeah one of
the

02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
um you know a issue about um needle
 
02:30:43.190 --> 02:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
hygiene hygiene of the needle and the
 
02:30:46.910 --> 02:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
certified um the course that the clean
 
02:30:50.429 --> 02:30:50.439 align:start position:0%
needling techniques needling techniques
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
um is it similar with the for across
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
acupuncture or is it different for
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
different areas of specialty in
 
02:31:04.590 --> 02:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
acupuncture does OPC know that I would
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
defer to the excert in the room who is
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
not myself I would say um this isn't
 
02:31:12.349 --> 02:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
relevant to the bill and here's why I
 
02:31:14.269 --> 02:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
mean I haven't seen a there there a
 
02:31:16.110 --> 02:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
language in here that keeps the rules in
 
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
exist assistance that are there now um
 
02:31:23.070 --> 02:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
to start yes it's I'm sorry it's on page
 
02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
one yeah I think line six and seven
 
02:31:29.790 --> 02:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
right now I have a I have a comment
 
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
about that purpose paragraph it seems
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
like it's it's added under the
 
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
acupuncture it is added under
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
acupuncture but it seems like it could
 
02:31:38.750 --> 02:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
be the purpose of the whole bill but I
 
02:31:40.630 --> 02:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
guess that's another conversation yeah
 
02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
there and then I was going to get to
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
that um some people are uncomfortable
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
and on the full committee at least are
 
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with with to eliminate
 
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers and provide State
 
02:31:51.269 --> 02:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
supervision over regulatory bodies
 
02:31:52.990 --> 02:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
compares to Market
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
participants um I know certain members
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
of the full committee have an issue at
 
02:31:59.309 --> 02:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
least with the first part of that to
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
right and and it is in every one of
 
02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
these yeah and I am fine taking we can
 
02:32:05.790 --> 02:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
make a a motion for an amendment to take
 
02:32:09.190 --> 02:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
that out everywhere and that that point
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
I wanted to make is that acupuncture is
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
an Allied Health profession but at the
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
same time it's a penetrative like a
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
needle being injected right the safety
 
02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
that's my Public Safety hat comes in and
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
but this is still going to require
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
licensing for everybody who has to have
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
licensing now and the rules going to
 
02:32:35.309 --> 02:32:35.319 align:start position:0%
stay the same and the detox Specialists
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
are covered under here and there is
 
02:32:39.309 --> 02:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
required training so I don't think this
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill would change any of that unless
 
02:32:43.110 --> 02:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
oplc goes crazy and decides they're
 
02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
going to remove that requirement which
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know rule making somebody would
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
raise an issue if she lost her mind so
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
not that I'm
 
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
suspecting my one last question in that
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
is it customary to say replacing the
 
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
board with executive director or is it
 
02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
board p on mine please this is page
 
02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:07.830 align:start position:0%
board p on mine please this is page
two

02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
line one at the 10 yeah that's Lang
 
02:33:12.670 --> 02:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's language in every Advisory Board
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
today right the board replacing board
 
02:33:23.190 --> 02:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the executive director is it
 
02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
not that's what changes if the Advisory
 
02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Board and all the advisory boards that
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
existence today have that language I
 
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
think your question though is whether it
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
should be executive director or office
 
02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
and the typical way of doing that in
 
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
state government because the
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner is responsible for
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
administration of the office is to
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
identify the commissioner who then
 
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:43.240 align:start position:0%
delegates that Authority right she
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't or I'm I'm just thinking is is
 
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
oplc office of no no because you need a
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
person who a state official responsible
 
02:33:56.910 --> 02:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
for executing an implementing the job
 
02:33:59.190 --> 02:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
and implementing the statute and and
 
02:34:01.790 --> 02:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
since she's the head of oplc it ends up
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
saying it's executive director means
 
02:34:06.510 --> 02:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
oplc basically
 
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
okay repres Brown Y and and somewhere
 
02:34:11.950 --> 02:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
that should have that should follow
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
through so usually somewhere back in
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
statute it says the
 
02:34:19.790 --> 02:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
oplc and it identifies the executive
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
director and then every time you see
 
02:34:23.550 --> 02:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
executive director it it means that same
 
02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:26.120 align:start position:0%
thing I think it's RSA 310 that sets up
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
oplc would have that in there and I
 
02:34:32.269 --> 02:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
think so I I see page one line 25 the
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
executive director in consultation with
 
02:34:37.389 --> 02:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
the board shall adopt rules is this
 
02:34:39.389 --> 02:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
541a that's the standard Ru making for
 
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
all legislation and so that means that
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
she'd consult with the board they'd come
 
02:34:49.469 --> 02:34:49.479 align:start position:0%
up with rules not her necessarily
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
personally but somebody works for her
 
02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
and then that's got to go out for public
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
comment they take public comment they
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
have to have a public hearing and you
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
know maybe change the rules based on
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
that with the input they get and then it
 
02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
goes before the joint legislative
 
02:35:06.550 --> 02:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee on rules which will review it
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's that whole process
 
02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:10.870 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's that whole process
so

02:35:10.870 --> 02:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
meance I know you're new to Ed but
 
02:35:15.150 --> 02:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see 541a through most of our
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
stuff and that's what means no I'm just
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
looking at checks and balances in terms
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
of you know not one Authority yeah she
 
02:35:24.190 --> 02:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
can't on her own come up with rules and
 
02:35:27.389 --> 02:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
they become law on our own um it's
 
02:35:29.710 --> 02:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of process to that which
 
02:35:32.910 --> 02:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
is which it should be okay uh
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative gold would you like a
 
02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
motion to uh remove that language um in
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
each of the sections of this bill sure
 
02:35:44.070 --> 02:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
and so this is an amendment
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
now do you want to remove
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
moove just to eliminate Workforce
 
02:35:55.349 --> 02:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
barriers uh and remove that um or and
 
02:35:58.349 --> 02:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
basically to CH to to change it to to to
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
provide State supervision over
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies comprised of active
 
02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
Market participants because that's the
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
removing the issues of the board
 
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
liability or reducing it and the
 
02:36:14.670 --> 02:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about um antitrust suit and
 
02:36:17.389 --> 02:36:17.399 align:start position:0%
just remove eliminate workfor barriers
 
02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
and the word and or do you want to
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
remove the whole sentence up to the
 
02:36:25.590 --> 02:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
comma I just want to get idea of her
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
motion and then we can we can discuss we
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
can discuss thank
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
you well I could be flexible with it um
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
but if the wording to eliminate
 
02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:39.030 align:start position:0%
but if the wording to eliminate
Workforce

02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
barriers is an obstacle to getting the
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
bill passed then my motion would be to
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
remove that line
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
um yeah so it would be to remove to it
 
02:36:50.510 --> 02:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
would remove the words eliminate
 
02:36:54.269 --> 02:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers and correct and and I
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
think it's the same elsewhere but if
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
it's worded slightly differently it
 
02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be basically to make it consistent
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
all the way through all right so uh
 
02:37:02.040 --> 02:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
all the way through all right so uh
remove

02:37:03.750 --> 02:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
remove
 
02:37:07.630 --> 02:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
words eliminate Workforce barriers and
 
02:37:09.870 --> 02:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
provide oh
 
02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
and eliminate Workforce barriers and and
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and this would be throughout the
 
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:19.309 align:start position:0%
um uh and this would be throughout the
bill

02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
correct you oppose that okay so I I I'll
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
second it actually so this is uh Gould
 
02:37:28.230 --> 02:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
and we can have then let me write this
 
02:37:31.150 --> 02:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and I think representative
 
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
Brown was first and then representative
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
Bailey yep so not every single one of
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
these advisory boards has a purpose
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
statement but a few of them do and let's
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
see let's start with
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
I made my note here so page six on line
 
02:37:54.510 --> 02:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
2329 well there's more of the purpose
 
02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
starting at line 20 but that's an
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
existing law so several a couple of them
 
02:38:03.790 --> 02:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
say to reduce work force barriers not
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
eliminate and maybe that's a better
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
wording but the the purpose here is
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
worded pretty
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
differently than it is on
 
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:21.870 --> 02:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
I and I guess it's fair each board could
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
have a different purpose stated I
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
suppose right I mean I I would take this
 
02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
when I went to OLS and did the amendment
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
that on page and we could do them
 
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
individually but I if I understand the
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
idea page
 
02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
six uh starting at line 23 yeah I would
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
um I would just remove to reduce
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers and promote
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency and economy and just have it
 
02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
start with the responsibility for
 
02:38:49.269 --> 02:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
invitations chapter shall be
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
transferred right I would take and and
 
02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
here's there is Mr chair if you see the
 
02:38:58.269 --> 02:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
20 line 20 to
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
23 is the original language and the
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
bolded one refers to Workforce barriers
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
right I'm saying is to take on the
 
02:39:11.790 --> 02:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
bolded language to remove
 
02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
everything up to the
 
02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:17.230 align:start position:0%
everything up to the
responsibility

02:39:17.230 --> 02:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
because the responsibility is stating
 
02:39:22.349 --> 02:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
what this would do and and here's an
 
02:39:22.359 --> 02:39:25.870 align:start position:0%
what this would do and and here's an
actually

02:39:25.870 --> 02:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
um but really I should let you first
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
speak about your motion then I'll speak
 
02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
and then anybody else is the process and
 
02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
I don't mind going through each one but
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
honestly on line 23 on page six if we
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
remove reduced Workforce barriers and
 
02:39:42.389 --> 02:39:42.399 align:start position:0%
and it says to promote efficiency and
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
economy the responsibility for
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of this chapter shall be
 
02:39:48.910 --> 02:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
transferred to the director uh to the
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
executive director of The Office of
 
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything wrong with right I
 
02:39:56.670 --> 02:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
mean if you're we could go through one
 
02:39:58.590 --> 02:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
by one but if you're okay with I mean I
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
understand what you want to do so that
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
one my my take on that one is that the s
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
that sentence would start with the
 
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility for implementation and
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
leave the preperatory Clause out that's
 
02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
fine okay and and a question on that
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
sure well let me speak a little bit
 
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
about why I want I mean I don't have a
 
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
problem with those clauses I don't
 
02:40:23.110 --> 02:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
disagree with them but I know they make
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
some people they strike some people on
 
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
the full committee as um not com they're
 
02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
not comfortable with it and I don't
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
think they add any value um other than
 
02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
saying why the bill was brought forward
 
02:40:38.349 --> 02:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
they don't add any value to the to the
 
02:40:40.590 --> 02:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
actual thing and why keep something that
 
02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
people are going to be uncomfortable
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
with so my question and actually would
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
um represent Bailey had asked to speak
 
02:40:50.349 --> 02:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
first and then M well we hear often that
 
02:40:52.389 --> 02:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these licenses is to
 
02:40:56.110 --> 02:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
protect the public and but sometimes I
 
02:40:58.590 --> 02:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
hear things that suggest that we do
 
02:41:02.110 --> 02:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
think of these licenses as a guild and
 
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's pretty obvious that this is not a
 
02:41:08.110 --> 02:41:08.120 align:start position:0%
guild it's to reduce Workforce barriers
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
right I don't just I don't think it
 
02:41:11.469 --> 02:41:11.479 align:start position:0%
hurts anything but I think it underlines
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
the main point this is for saving lives
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
not for establishing a
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
right I don't as I said I don't disagree
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
with that I'm just looking at uh as a
 
02:41:24.070 --> 02:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
practical sense of getting support for
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
it that's all so I mean you don't have
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
to vote for
 
02:41:31.710 --> 02:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
it uh go on sorry and maybe one of the
 
02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
ones that spoke sorry did you say me uh
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
I think represent mipi had a pending
 
02:41:41.670 --> 02:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair um there were some
 
02:41:46.349 --> 02:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility was uh when oplc got the
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
licensing uh
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility last
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
year it included all these boards right
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's the shift now what we are looking
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
at it's not so much the
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
workforce barrier or it's more changing
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
the board who has a regulatory
 
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility who has a uh Ru making
 
02:42:15.070 --> 02:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility by changing the board
 
02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:17.830 align:start position:0%
responsibility by changing the board
from

02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.429 --> 02:42:20.439 align:start position:0%
advisory to whichever
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
way yeah so my general position on lure
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
is that it's
 
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
a necessary barrier to
 
02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
Workforce if to protect the public so
 
02:42:36.150 --> 02:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's the only legitimate reason to
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
license somebody um but it is a barrier
 
02:42:41.550 --> 02:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
because you're requiring somebody to
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
take an affirmative step and if you have
 
02:42:46.349 --> 02:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
procedures in place and criteria in
 
02:42:48.990 --> 02:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
place that actually is not related to
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
protecting the public then that becomes
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary barrier so when we talk
 
02:42:56.469 --> 02:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
about antitrust issues Market
 
02:42:58.870 --> 02:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
participants some of the concern is that
 
02:43:01.469 --> 02:43:01.479 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the lure criteria is not a
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
necessary barrier to protect the public
 
02:43:07.070 --> 02:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
because it's completely unrelated or
 
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't establish minimum competencies
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case then yes I would
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
definitely say that the purpose
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
statement makes sense to reduce work
 
02:43:17.230 --> 02:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
first barriers cuz what you're saying is
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to cut out all of the extra
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
stuff that is not necessary to protect
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
the public and make sure that the only
 
02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
thing we're asking for is necessary to
 
02:43:29.309 --> 02:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
competency so can I just follow up with
 
02:43:36.750 --> 02:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
that one so you're saying we are R
 
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
lowering the threshold for Public Safety
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
no what I'm saying is here's an example
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
with the acupuncture board with the PLC
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
313 which is implementing the statute
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
from last year so the rules that were
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
referenced by Miss Rob were our rules
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so we received her comments and were
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
able to adjust them because they were
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
our rules the conversation that I had
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
with the board of acupuncture was you
 
02:44:03.790 --> 02:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
know they should have our rulle said you
 
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
should have this level of Education this
 
02:44:09.309 --> 02:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
level of training um pay this fee their
 
02:44:11.990 --> 02:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
comments were largely centered around
 
02:44:13.389 --> 02:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
things that I don't think are necessary
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
to protect the public like
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
the other state should ensure that they
 
02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
are that applicants are required to
 
02:44:24.510 --> 02:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
submit a passport photograph in order to
 
02:44:26.429 --> 02:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
get licensed and if that state doesn't
 
02:44:28.510 --> 02:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
require that then we should not find
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
that state has substantially similar
 
02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
requirements I don't think that
 
02:44:34.389 --> 02:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
submitting a passport photograph is
 
02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the public and I
 
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually think it promotes implicit bias
 
02:44:40.670 --> 02:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the licensing evaluation process and
 
02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
so I did not take those comments and
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
include that in and and make changes in
 
02:44:47.190 --> 02:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
the proposal so those are the type of
 
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
things that we're talking about
 
02:44:53.910 --> 02:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
um by eliminating those what I consider
 
02:44:57.070 --> 02:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
to be unnecessary requirements you are
 
02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.750 align:start position:0%
 
entry

02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
entry
 
02:45:05.150 --> 02:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
um okay so we have a
 
02:45:09.469 --> 02:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
motion um this is to well we have a
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
first of all whether these words are in
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
here or not does not change the effect
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
of the statute whatsoever and
 
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative Courtney is that I mean
 
02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
not representative I'm I'm going to cut
 
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
your pay too now uh director Courtney um
 
02:45:26.349 --> 02:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
volunteer position yeah that's right I
 
02:45:28.469 --> 02:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
don't think she's crazy enough to
 
02:45:31.950 --> 02:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer um no the qu my statement is
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
removing that language from the purpose
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
statements is not going to have any
 
02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
operational effect in in how the board
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
the whole oplc works or the boards
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
correct the only thing that I think we
 
02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
do need is is this language that I know
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
this committee was um interested in um
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
is requiring the executive director to
 
02:45:54.349 --> 02:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
consult with The Advisory board when
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
implementing the chapters and then
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
keeping the language that says rules in
 
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
effect um in effect on the effective
 
02:46:02.630 --> 02:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
date that is what we would need from an
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
operation standpoint okay and I'm not
 
02:46:06.630 --> 02:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
proposing we're not proposing changing
 
02:46:10.750 --> 02:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
that so okay um so we have a motion to
 
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate the words we've discussed from
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere in this bill
 
02:46:19.110 --> 02:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to take a vote um all those
 
02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:20.389 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to take a vote um all those
in

02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
favor I okay anyone
 
02:46:27.309 --> 02:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
opposed okay that's fine oh you are as
 
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
well okay later on we can I'm curious as
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
to why no discussion is closed
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
discussion is closed let me let me uh
 
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah right um no no I just want to
 
02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:40.070 align:start position:0%
yeah right um no no I just want to
record

02:46:40.070 --> 02:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
this one two anyway it's three what just
 
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
a moment yeah um three to two so um the
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
committee has I haven't voted yet yep oh
 
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
sorry no
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
sorry what are the words because it's
 
02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
different throughout the document so
 
02:47:00.269 --> 02:47:00.279 align:start position:0%
again so the word the words um the words
 
02:47:01.790 --> 02:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
that are the effect of eliminate
 
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers um that part of it or
 
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
in page six it was a little more
 
02:47:10.469 --> 02:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
extensive uh reduce Workforce barriers
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
and promote efficiency in economy taking
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
words of that sort out wherever
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're in here I found a few more
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
instances I'm sure there are more if you
 
02:47:21.790 --> 02:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
would like me to that' be great give
 
02:47:24.110 --> 02:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
them is that just email to I don't know
 
02:47:26.349 --> 02:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
unless you want to talk to well just and
 
02:47:28.349 --> 02:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
so people see that
 
02:47:31.830 --> 02:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
are reluctant to support it on page 11
 
02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
if you look at line
 
02:47:37.550 --> 02:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
28 we would remove reduce Workforce
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
barriers and provide State supervision
 
02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
well the state supervision We need oh
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
yeah to reduce it's so it's just reduce
 
02:47:47.429 --> 02:47:47.439 align:start position:0%
work force barriers and and right that's
 
02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
what I would do yep I and I like the way
 
02:47:52.590 --> 02:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
that one's written but and so that's all
 
02:47:55.910 --> 02:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're removing is redu that offensive to
 
02:47:58.510 --> 02:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
some people language we really are back
 
02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
into so I'm yes so if we move the
 
02:48:05.309 --> 02:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
language to reduce Workforce barriers or
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
and to eliminate Workforce barriers then
 
02:48:13.830 --> 02:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
I'm a yes okay so the vote is 3 to2 and
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
that will be in included in we'll have a
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
probably a final vote on the amendment
 
02:48:22.510 --> 02:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
but procedural question Mr uh Mr chair y
 
02:48:25.429 --> 02:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
if the two members if if some of the
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
members who voted no didn't understand
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
what we were voting on then somebody can
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
make a vote to
 
02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
reconsider I I'm not saying I don't
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
understand what it is but we'll have
 
02:48:37.150 --> 02:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
another opportunity at the full
 
02:48:39.389 --> 02:48:39.399 align:start position:0%
committee to look at and the
 
02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is going you know it is
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
passing the by the way these votes are
 
02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
not am I yeah these votes um they're
 
02:48:49.110 --> 02:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
just guiding you to write an amendment
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
but if we leave it in there if we don't
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
put it in the amendment and then we had
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
the floor go back we're wasting o o
 
02:48:59.349 --> 02:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the lawyers downstairs time no
 
02:49:01.710 --> 02:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
I I mean I guess the question is and
 
02:49:04.389 --> 02:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
this is just general discussion um if
 
02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
there's anybody who voted no on this who
 
02:49:10.349 --> 02:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
um that would prevent them from if they
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
agreed otherwise from voting on the full
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to support of the full
 
02:49:15.870 --> 02:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment GL
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
we have two more chances right one is
 
02:49:21.070 --> 02:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
the full committee we have to vote and
 
02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
have a discussion as a sub committee as
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
well we have another like we did last
 
02:49:27.870 --> 02:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
time on 1410 we'll have a now hopefully
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
if people have an issue we know before
 
02:49:32.269 --> 02:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
that but yeah yeah and and uh I think
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
that would help in having a cleaner
 
02:49:39.070 --> 02:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment with what's removed and to see
 
02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:40.469 align:start position:0%
Amendment with what's removed and to see
it

02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
and trying to think of process here I'm
 
02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
I mean if there's anybody who is
 
02:49:52.750 --> 02:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
interested in changing how their vote
 
02:49:54.229 --> 02:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
their vote how they voted given the
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
discussion we had during the vote which
 
02:49:59.469 --> 02:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
was not quite appropriate maybe um they
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
can make a motion to reconsider we can
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
do that um
 
02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise um all I'm asking is I just
 
02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
need a yes or no answer that's it if we
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
C make this amendment taking those words
 
02:50:14.319 --> 02:50:15.269 align:start position:0%
C make this amendment taking those words
out

02:50:15.269 --> 02:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
is will that prevent anyone from voting
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
on the final Amendment if they agree
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.429 --> 02:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment it
 
02:50:31.469 --> 02:50:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.710 --> 02:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
um all right we'll we'll let's let's set
 
02:50:37.550 --> 02:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
this aside for the moment and I we'll
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
talk separate and
 
02:50:43.309 --> 02:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
decide I I do have a suggestion yes uh
 
02:50:46.870 --> 02:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
real quickly so if you look at page 25
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
25 starting on line
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
one that it doesn't say that it's a
 
02:50:57.070 --> 02:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
purpose statement but I like I like so
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's in the law already reads very
 
02:51:00.830 --> 02:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
well I think the general court to
 
02:51:01.950 --> 02:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
protect the health safety and Welfare of
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire EST as a
 
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory program from XYZ page 25
 
02:51:08.590 --> 02:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
starting at the top starting at the top
 
02:51:11.950 --> 02:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
so the non-bold is what's in the law now
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
and I think that's well said and then
 
02:51:18.229 --> 02:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
it then the the remainder of it reflects
 
02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
the other the others that we have okay
 
02:51:22.830 --> 02:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
so here here's what I I'd like to do um
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
clearly we're going to have to meet
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
again on this bill so um I'd like
 
02:51:29.790 --> 02:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
representative Gould and anyone else who
 
02:51:33.389 --> 02:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
wants to to um look through here and
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
find all the places where there's
 
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
similar language and I'd like that
 
02:51:38.429 --> 02:51:38.439 align:start position:0%
emailed out just to the subcommittee
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
members okay and if anybody has a a a
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
suggestion for
 
02:51:47.870 --> 02:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
um alternate language for those places
 
02:51:49.630 --> 02:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
like maybe you know what's already in
 
02:51:52.190 --> 02:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
statute that and if every you know send
 
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
that out an email to the to all just the
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we don't need to confuse
 
02:51:58.030 --> 02:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
the full committee on it and then in a
 
02:51:59.790 --> 02:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
later meeting we can discuss what we
 
02:52:03.150 --> 02:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
want to do and and we can you know the
 
02:52:05.229 --> 02:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
sort of informal vote we just took We
 
02:52:06.990 --> 02:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
could decide we want to do something
 
02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:08.030 align:start position:0%
could decide we want to do something
different

02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:52:13.469 --> 02:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
okay excellent excellent so um so I
 
02:52:13.479 --> 02:52:15.190 align:start position:0%
okay excellent excellent so um so I
would

02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion just to move things
 
02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
along and this is an amendment well it's
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
not really an amendment it's just our
 
02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
intent and that is uh
 
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
keep um you know this the part one um on
 
02:52:32.670 --> 02:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
acupuncture so keep the changes to
 
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%

02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
we just make on the um changes to
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
the per you know the purpose language
 
02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
but but to keep that in the bill so that
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
we would actually uh move the board of
 
02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:50.030 align:start position:0%
we would actually uh move the board of
acupuncture

02:52:50.030 --> 02:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
acupuncture
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
to um an Advisory Board second okay and
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%

02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
luus second by
 
02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
gold okay um do we need more discussion
 
02:53:04.389 --> 02:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
we've spent a while on this I mean can
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
we go to a vote all in
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
favor anyone
 
02:53:13.550 --> 02:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
opposed right to accepting the language
 
02:53:15.349 --> 02:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's in that part of the bill dealing
 
02:53:15.359 --> 02:53:16.190 align:start position:0%
that's in that part of the bill dealing
with

02:53:16.190 --> 02:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
acupuncture except we may change the
 
02:53:20.190 --> 02:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
purpose State and as part of the general
 
02:53:23.710 --> 02:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
redo of that yeah okay and so the vot
 
02:53:26.349 --> 02:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
vote is anyone opposed that's five to
 
02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
zero okay thank you um so then there's a
 
02:53:31.830 --> 02:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
a practical
 
02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
question um it's approaching one o'clock
 
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
I know some people need lunch some
 
02:53:38.590 --> 02:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
people have issues with not going too
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
long with without food so and I know
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's at least one member that needs
 
02:53:44.510 --> 02:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
to be out of here she's not not
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily the only one and uh and we
 
02:53:49.469 --> 02:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
need to and there's someone here who
 
02:53:52.030 --> 02:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
needs to leave at
 
02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
2:30 who would do that who would do that
 
02:53:57.790 --> 02:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
and the thing is if we left now for
 
02:54:01.630 --> 02:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
lunch we wouldn't be back until 1:45 to
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
and so and I don't want to and I don't
 
02:54:05.309 --> 02:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
know what your situation is as far as
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
how long you folks can hang around they
 
02:54:10.110 --> 02:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
live here they live here you certainly
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
may we talked about um when next
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday when the in the morning in the
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
morning if we can uh put this one at
 
02:54:32.110 --> 02:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah Wednesday morning okay
 
02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:37.880 align:start position:0%
um so first of all well actually why
 
02:54:40.950 --> 02:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't you ask your question
 
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
so and actually what I'm going to do if
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're not going to to continue today I
 
02:54:47.950 --> 02:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
will close the subcommittee work session
 
02:54:49.229 --> 02:54:49.239 align:start position:0%
and then we can have that so people are
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
freed up um so if if people agreed we're
 
02:54:55.190 --> 02:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
not going to uh continue today I'm going
 
02:54:58.229 --> 02:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
to close the subcommittee um work
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
02:55:02.910 --> 02:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
1271 thank what unless you have I I have
 
02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
a question so we know the acupuncture
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
board was concerned and they were here
 
02:55:09.950 --> 02:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm reopening it we heard sorry we've
 
02:55:11.469 --> 02:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
heard from a lot of other boards but no
 
02:55:15.190 --> 02:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
one else is here today uh do we have any
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
any stomach for just no going Opa now uh
 
02:55:23.550 --> 02:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
on the whole bill with the change to
 
02:55:25.110 --> 02:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah on the whole bill with the changes
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the purpose I I would be okay with
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
that but similar to what I said when we
 
02:55:33.269 --> 02:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
started this section
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I question
 
02:55:39.269 --> 02:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
whether um that would be good even
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
assuming everybody here agreed it'd be
 
02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
questioned you know whether that would
 
02:55:46.229 --> 02:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
be an issue although I don't know that's
 
02:55:48.510 --> 02:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
fair yeah that's fair I I would say you
 
02:55:51.429 --> 02:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
know we are taking too many votes before
 
02:55:54.990 --> 02:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
we are com at least you know I don't
 
02:55:57.190 --> 02:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable just saying okay fine
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%

02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's already 14 no no no no no no no
 
02:57:18.389 --> 02:57:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's part of this
 
02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
um it we're let's look at
 
02:57:25.389 --> 02:57:25.399 align:start position:0%
the I didn't know if you knew off the
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
top of your head no no it's it needs to
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
be what's the what I wrote Hang four
 
02:57:33.150 --> 02:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's already see that that gets rid of
 
02:57:33.160 --> 02:57:34.950 align:start position:0%
it's already see that that gets rid of
328

02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
328
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
G6 um we have a okay uh we're going to
 
02:57:39.790 --> 02:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue but a brief
 
02:57:41.349 --> 02:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
question still on the acupuncture one
 
02:57:43.710 --> 02:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
just a technical thing um what page is
 
02:57:47.150 --> 02:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
what 6 line 9 page six
 
02:57:49.870 --> 02:57:49.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we're fine but I had made a
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
note before that it's already in
 
02:57:54.349 --> 02:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
1410 but I I can't no but that's
 
02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
acupuncture 1410 was U um medical
 
02:58:01.710 --> 02:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
different but 14 1410 didn't deal with
 
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
medical with with acupuncture whatsoever
 
02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think uh professional
 
02:58:18.309 --> 02:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:20.349 --> 02:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
um 328
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
G6 would have
 
02:58:31.790 --> 02:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:31.800 --> 02:58:33.790 align:start position:0%
 
g

02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
g
 
02:58:36.630 --> 02:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
SN I think I looked at that enough I
 
02:58:38.110 --> 02:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
think I would have caught it all right
 
02:58:41.389 --> 02:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
um so this is what we're dealing with
 
02:58:44.349 --> 02:58:44.359 align:start position:0%
here if people are ready to move for
 
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
forward um this section starts at Page 6
 
02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
line 11 through Page
 
02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
11 line
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
18 and what I would like to do it's got
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
the thing about the workforce barriers
 
02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
which you know we we're dealing with
 
02:59:02.429 --> 02:59:02.439 align:start position:0%
separately so I don't want to get into
 
02:59:07.710 --> 02:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
that on this section Mr chair it's not
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
911 it's line we are looking at the
 
02:59:14.590 --> 02:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
family mediator 19
 
02:59:18.229 --> 02:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's page six line 11 am
 
02:59:22.510 --> 02:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
I 19 oh no I probably it's all I
 
02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
probably made a mistake L 19 okay thank
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
you for the correction I will
 
02:59:33.790 --> 02:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.990 --> 02:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
notes6 oh yeah I messed up thank you all
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
right I have a fundamental question
 
02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:42.830 align:start position:0%
right I have a fundamental question
okay

02:59:42.830 --> 02:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:59:49.630 --> 02:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
um to I okay uh director
 
02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
coordin is this an Advisory board right
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.389 --> 03:00:03.399 align:start position:0%
a did it it's a regulatory board right
 
03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
now yes correct it's an independent
 
03:00:11.190 --> 03:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory board and I can tell you
 
03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:12.750 align:start position:0%
regulatory board and I can tell you
currently

03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:16.309 align:start position:0%
currently
has

03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:19.510 --> 03:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
they had two meetings last year in
 
03:00:21.469 --> 03:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
November they cancelled all but two of
 
03:00:21.479 --> 03:00:22.630 align:start position:0%
November they cancelled all but two of
their

03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:00:25.229 --> 03:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
meetings how often do they
 
03:00:28.229 --> 03:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
meet they had two meetings last
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
months and I if my memory serves me
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
correctly they have 47 lenses I can
 
03:00:45.070 --> 03:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
confirm that for you number and
 
03:00:48.030 --> 03:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
our main concern is that there are
 
03:00:49.870 --> 03:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
Quorum issues there have historically
 
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
been Quorum issues that said we did just
 
03:00:53.590 --> 03:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
get a new member many of these
 
03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
appointments are not by the governor so
 
03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's another part of the challenge we
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
did just get another judicial
 
03:01:00.990 --> 03:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
appointment and they're very you know
 
03:01:02.750 --> 03:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're very
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
engaged um
 
03:01:08.630 --> 03:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
but but yes that's the primary issue and
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
I don't recall any um uh opposition
 
03:01:16.429 --> 03:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
coming from any family mediators to this
 
03:01:21.389 --> 03:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill I don't recall seeing any um three
 
03:01:23.309 --> 03:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
member board five so yeah what is the
 
03:01:24.469 --> 03:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
what is the current membership of the
 
03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
board and how would this part of the
 
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill change it it's good good question
 
03:01:31.950 --> 03:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
so I see corrected they have
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
37 lenes 37 no it's even worse and one
 
03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
two three five member board okay and uh
 
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
what what would this does this make
 
03:01:45.349 --> 03:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
changes the board I'm sorry for it does
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah three
 
03:01:52.870 --> 03:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
page thank you and it also changes who
 
03:01:56.309 --> 03:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
appoints one of the judges that I
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
saw yeah it changes from five to three
 
03:02:01.150 --> 03:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
yeah can you talk about the changes and
 
03:02:06.190 --> 03:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
board so I think the idea was to reduce
 
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
the number of board members to be
 
03:02:13.229 --> 03:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with the number of board
 
03:02:16.590 --> 03:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
members we typically see on advisory
 
03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
boards um so the first one was one judge
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
who regularly sits in the Circuit Court
 
03:02:23.790 --> 03:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
Family Division currently appointed by
 
03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
just judge king the administrative judge
 
03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
of the Circuit Court um I'm not sure why
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
this was change to the Chief Justice I
 
03:02:32.389 --> 03:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
think it could be either
 
03:02:37.229 --> 03:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
way um the second one was uh essentially
 
03:02:39.870 --> 03:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
removing the public member so there's
 
03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
there would no longer be a public member
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
and that again that's typical for
 
03:02:46.950 --> 03:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
advisory boards that's that's typical
 
03:02:48.990 --> 03:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
the next change is there's currently a
 
03:02:50.670 --> 03:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that there be a member of
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Bar Association which
 
03:02:54.590 --> 03:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
is basically any attorney who's licensed
 
03:02:56.910 --> 03:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but um we added
 
03:02:59.349 --> 03:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
specializing in family law
 
03:03:03.150 --> 03:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
matters because Family Mediation you
 
03:03:04.830 --> 03:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
know it seems to make sense that you
 
03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
have that
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
experience and then rather than having
 
03:03:10.670 --> 03:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
three certified family members who
 
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
historically have been nominated by
 
03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
historically have been nominated by
associations

03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
associations
 
03:03:18.349 --> 03:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
which I I personally find problematic
 
03:03:20.590 --> 03:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
just generally because associations the
 
03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of an association is to promote
 
03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
the profession and the purpose of a
 
03:03:27.150 --> 03:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory board is to protect the
 
03:03:29.870 --> 03:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
public and they don't always H share the
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
same objectives so when you have an
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
association in Vermont it's actually if
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're not ethically Pro allowed to be
 
03:03:41.070 --> 03:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
on a board of an association and on a
 
03:03:44.190 --> 03:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory board um so I find it
 
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
problematic when associations are doing
 
03:03:47.389 --> 03:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
the appointments because they're likely
 
03:03:49.229 --> 03:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
to find members who are going to further
 
03:03:51.870 --> 03:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
their objectives while being on the
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory board so anyways um this was
 
03:03:58.590 --> 03:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
changed from um 3 to one and then
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
eliminating the nomination by the
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
Association so
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
um just I i' like a follow up then I'll
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
go back to you if that's all right um so
 
03:04:12.309 --> 03:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
having the New Hampshire bar in there as
 
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
the association is okay because they're
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
not supposedly presumably don't have an
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
interest in Family Mediation directly
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
the whole organization or right so this
 
03:04:23.110 --> 03:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
goes back to our earlier conversation
 
03:04:24.910 --> 03:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
off the Record which is that every
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
attorney is required to be a member of
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bar association it's not a voluntary
 
03:04:32.710 --> 03:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
Association but um I guess
 
03:04:35.309 --> 03:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
the you know it I guess the question is
 
03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
is there some
 
03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
organization other than the bar that
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
might be better to do it but then I
 
03:04:43.830 --> 03:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't know it's better than giving them
 
03:04:45.750 --> 03:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
all to you to appoint I suppose or I
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
mean you could have the Supreme Court
 
03:04:49.070 --> 03:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
appoint them they are technically the
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory body for for
 
03:04:55.150 --> 03:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys who they've essentially
 
03:04:57.670 --> 03:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
um outsourced some of that function to
 
03:04:58.990 --> 03:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
the bar association but you could
 
03:05:00.750 --> 03:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
certainly have the Supreme Court do it
 
03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not objecting I'm just uh wondering
 
03:05:05.389 --> 03:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay representative maputi um I just
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
have to go back to a statement you made
 
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
about the association being a member or
 
03:05:14.229 --> 03:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
Board of uh you know a board member on
 
03:05:17.790 --> 03:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
an association in my profession I had to
 
03:05:19.469 --> 03:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
be a board member I mean not board
 
03:05:20.990 --> 03:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
member I had to be a member of an
 
03:05:23.389 --> 03:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
association in order to be licensed in
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
order to be certified in state and like
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
the speech and hearing Association Asha
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
you had to be a member later on it was
 
03:05:33.469 --> 03:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
changed that you don't have to be a
 
03:05:36.670 --> 03:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
member but you have to pay dues to the
 
03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
membership and so there are different
 
03:05:40.200 --> 03:05:41.550 align:start position:0%
membership and so there are different
professions

03:05:41.550 --> 03:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
professions
 
03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
where being a member of an association
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
will not you can't have a license
 
03:05:50.590 --> 03:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but this doesn't
 
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit somebody being a member of the
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
association from being on the board it's
 
03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
just the association can't pick them is
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
that correct yeah I think there are two
 
03:05:59.550 --> 03:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
different issues here there those are
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
essentially Association board
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
certifications if you will what we're
 
03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
talking about is let's say you have the
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Medical Society which is
 
03:06:09.309 --> 03:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
the professional association for
 
03:06:11.630 --> 03:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
Physicians um if you are on that board
 
03:06:14.990 --> 03:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
of directors and your job and your fiary
 
03:06:17.229 --> 03:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to promote the
 
03:06:19.309 --> 03:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
profession and you are also on a
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
regulatory board and your job is to
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
protect the public they don't always
 
03:06:28.030 --> 03:06:28.040 align:start position:0%
meet in the middle and so you can be a
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
member of the medical society but you
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have the fiduciary
 
03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a board member to
 
03:06:36.990 --> 03:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
promote the profession and then also be
 
03:06:38.990 --> 03:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
on a regulatory board because there
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
could be a conflict of interest that's
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we're talking about
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay it's not okay I I'll figure it out
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay I think the key is it doesn't
 
03:06:52.150 --> 03:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit the person appointed being a
 
03:06:54.510 --> 03:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
member of the association it's just the
 
03:06:55.630 --> 03:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
association doesn't pick up
 
03:06:58.389 --> 03:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
chair so in the cases where that isn't
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
the case you're getting uh nominations
 
03:07:05.429 --> 03:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
are you getting sugest how do you get
 
03:07:08.030 --> 03:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
nominations then suggestions suggestions
 
03:07:10.110 --> 03:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
you you kind of canvas the the the
 
03:07:12.550 --> 03:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
industry or if it fall right so it's
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
going to fall back to oplc if there's no
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
one nominating if I'm reading it right
 
03:07:22.309 --> 03:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
we've taken out nominated by the by the
 
03:07:24.429 --> 03:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
Association then you're doing the
 
03:07:26.389 --> 03:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
nominations yeah so typically we send
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
out email blast to all lenses to give
 
03:07:30.670 --> 03:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
everyone an opportunity to submit an
 
03:07:33.309 --> 03:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
application they put an application and
 
03:07:35.790 --> 03:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
then we look at it for experience and
 
03:07:38.229 --> 03:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
their ability to commit to the volunteer
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
time is essentially what it looks like I
 
03:07:43.510 --> 03:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
just got to C for us um one other
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
question and that is on page eight um
 
03:07:49.150 --> 03:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
the second line it
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
um you can't
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
it is it it says you can't serve more
 
03:07:56.750 --> 03:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
than two consecutive terms which I'm
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
fine of what what was it before was
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
there no limit which is kind of said
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
that the acupun not more yeah it looks
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
like there was um it depended on who you
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
appointed by so earlier there was some
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
language if you're appointed by the
 
03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
court it would be up to the court or the
 
03:08:16.710 --> 03:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
administrative judge how long your
 
03:08:18.510 --> 03:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
length was and then if you're appointed
 
03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
by the governor um you eligible to serve
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
more than three full consecutive terms
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's just administratively difficult
 
03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
for us to manage you know who's up when
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
if it's just at the uh determination of
 
03:08:32.429 --> 03:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
a person and not something that we put
 
03:08:35.309 --> 03:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
in the red book okay and I I agree that
 
03:08:38.150 --> 03:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
I mean this would let somebody serve for
 
03:08:41.630 --> 03:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
six years which probably is shouldn't be
 
03:08:43.550 --> 03:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
longer than that I I guess my only
 
03:08:46.070 --> 03:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
practical question is given the number
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
of people involved in this is there
 
03:08:49.630 --> 03:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
going to be any problem finding people
 
03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:50.309 align:start position:0%
going to be any problem finding people
to

03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
serve if they can't serve more than two
 
03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
serve if they can't serve more than two
consecutive

03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
consecutive
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
terms that's hard to say I mean
 
03:08:58.150 --> 03:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
currently there's
 
03:09:00.870 --> 03:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
37 lenses I would hope they would be
 
03:09:03.349 --> 03:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
able to find one out of those 37 who
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
hadn't previously served and this
 
03:09:06.670 --> 03:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prevent somebody who'd served
 
03:09:09.070 --> 03:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
before from serving again later right
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you uh
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative maputi um I do have a
 
03:09:20.309 --> 03:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
comment and uh that is I understand the
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
intention of opening it up to all the
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
licy that you have access
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
to but don't you think it's the
 
03:09:32.750 --> 03:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
association is in a better position to
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
nominate somebody not the board member
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
Association board member but Association
 
03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:41.389 align:start position:0%
Association board member but Association
member

03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
member
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
to propose a board member to this oplc
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
board Advisory Board personally I don't
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
think so because they're going to pick
 
03:09:54.590 --> 03:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that is going to likely has an
 
03:09:56.030 --> 03:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
interest in what the association is
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
doing and I think opening it up to
 
03:09:59.630 --> 03:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
everybody give everybody an opportunity
 
03:10:02.990 --> 03:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
to participate is is more in line with
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh what we at state government should be
 
03:10:06.269 --> 03:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
doing there there's another practical
 
03:10:08.110 --> 03:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
issue here I don't think that make can
 
03:10:11.269 --> 03:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
work because if an association is going
 
03:10:13.790 --> 03:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation that can only
 
03:10:16.469 --> 03:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
be by a vote of the board because the
 
03:10:18.670 --> 03:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
board represents the association any
 
03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
random member in the
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
association can't represent the
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
association they can put themselves
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
forward as an
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
individual no I I didn't say they will
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
be represent board members will nominate
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
but the association can recommend an
 
03:10:38.190 --> 03:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
individual member to the board for
 
03:10:40.750 --> 03:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
oplc that yeah and that would uh that
 
03:10:42.550 --> 03:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
gets back to the conflict of interest
 
03:10:42.560 --> 03:10:43.710 align:start position:0%
gets back to the conflict of interest
thing

03:10:43.710 --> 03:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
no no it gets back to the conflict of
 
03:10:47.229 --> 03:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
interest issue if I'm No it's it's
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
similar to what uh director Courtney
 
03:10:52.590 --> 03:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
blasting to 37 members to say who is
 
03:10:55.229 --> 03:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
ready to vote I may not even know that a
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
board exists let me let me ask so
 
03:10:58.510 --> 03:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent the
 
03:11:02.110 --> 03:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
association from sending you a letter
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
recommending anybody no we don't need to
 
03:11:06.070 --> 03:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
have in statute for them to be able to
 
03:11:07.870 --> 03:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
do it correct okay if there is
 
03:11:09.790 --> 03:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity that's fine yeah there is
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
the the distinction is that um under the
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
scenario that's currently existing we
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
can't send out an email blastic the
 
03:11:19.710 --> 03:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
inform the recommendation can or the
 
03:11:23.229 --> 03:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
nomination can only come from the
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
association I have another question uh
 
03:11:27.750 --> 03:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr chair
 
03:11:29.150 --> 03:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
so another question about that
 
03:11:32.870 --> 03:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular line page eight line two uh
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
no member shall be appointed to more
 
03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
than two consecutive terms on page one
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
on line 18
 
03:11:43.550 --> 03:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
under acupuncturist it says more than
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
two consecutive full terms I don't know
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
if we want to make that consistent
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:52.990 --> 03:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
matters yeah this actually comes up a
 
03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
lot when somebody resigns midterm and
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
the question is whether or not they get
 
03:11:58.030 --> 03:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
they just have to finish out the
 
03:11:59.590 --> 03:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
person's prior term and then gets
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
another full term I mean so I would say
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
full term to make it clear thank you all
 
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
right uh no more than two consecutive
 
03:12:10.349 --> 03:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
full terms wherever that shows up in
 
03:12:12.229 --> 03:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
this yeah and if if we notice it
 
03:12:16.429 --> 03:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
anywhere else we can do the same okay is
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
there other than changing um the board
 
03:12:22.830 --> 03:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
membership and how they are
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
selected and making this and I see
 
03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
there's something about you know
 
03:12:29.469 --> 03:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
electing the chairman is there anything
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
else in
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
here that makes any change other than
 
03:12:35.790 --> 03:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
those necessary for making it an
 
03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:37.229 align:start position:0%
those necessary for making it an
Advisory

03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
Advisory
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
Board is it doing anything else what
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
n Mr chair I'd like to get answer this
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll sorry have my mic on I'm sorry
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
deletions on page nine seem like that
 
03:12:57.790 --> 03:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
has to do with the changes we've made to
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
oplc already
 
03:13:05.229 --> 03:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
Yes 23 to really I I really want to not
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
do anything further until I get an
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
answer to
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
this I I want to hear a verbal answer
 
03:13:14.190 --> 03:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
but there may be other yes that's
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
correct that deals with the time frames
 
03:13:18.349 --> 03:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
for for Li Insurance certification that
 
03:13:21.790 --> 03:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
we adjusted last session okay and then
 
03:13:25.389 --> 03:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
is there anything else in you know this
 
03:13:28.349 --> 03:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
area part of the bill that makes any
 
03:13:30.309 --> 03:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
change other than the ones we've
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
discussed other than the ones for making
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:41.560 --> 03:13:44.110 align:start position:0%
 
Board

03:13:44.110 --> 03:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
Board
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um yes in this it says board is
 
03:13:52.750 --> 03:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
crossed page page in line page nine I'm
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
just seeing board is crossed offine
 
03:13:58.590 --> 03:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
office line is six the first one and
 
03:14:01.110 --> 03:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's consistent board is crossed off
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
offic is in place but in occupy uh
 
03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
occupant thing it was said no we we
 
03:14:11.710 --> 03:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
executive director so there's no
 
03:14:11.720 --> 03:14:14.910 align:start position:0%
executive director so there's no
consistency

03:14:14.910 --> 03:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that what I would
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
agree I think it I personally I
 
03:14:22.469 --> 03:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
think the better approach is to say
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
executive director because the
 
03:14:25.790 --> 03:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner has responsibilities under
 
03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner has responsibilities under
other

03:14:26.950 --> 03:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
rsas but thank you for okay but I thank
 
03:14:31.710 --> 03:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
you for that back to the original
 
03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
question is there anything else getting
 
03:14:35.309 --> 03:14:35.319 align:start position:0%
changed in here other than the
 
03:14:37.670 --> 03:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
membership and voting for a chair and
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
making an
 
03:14:42.870 --> 03:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
advisory uh and and the no please and
 
03:14:44.030 --> 03:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
the and the cleaner I was going to get
 
03:14:46.750 --> 03:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
to your question okay yeah and then to
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
the point you brought
 
03:14:48.479 --> 03:14:50.510 align:start position:0%
the point you brought
up

03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:14:54.469 --> 03:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
um so I guess the thing is what areas in
 
03:14:56.550 --> 03:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
this part of this
 
03:15:00.750 --> 03:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill um so you pointed out where it went
 
03:15:05.229 --> 03:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
from board to line six see actually on
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
on page n yeah line 8 it's not
 
03:15:07.439 --> 03:15:08.469 align:start position:0%
on page n yeah line 8 it's not
consistent

03:15:08.469 --> 03:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
03:15:11.950 --> 03:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
line8 page 8 line 33 it does go Board of
 
03:15:15.870 --> 03:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
executive director but um all on page
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
nine yeah so actually yeah starting oh
 
03:15:26.590 --> 03:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
was it six 9 is it all right six 9 11 11
 
03:15:28.710 --> 03:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
12 yep
 
03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
16 y 18 oh jeez Y and also 35 and 35 and
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
let me see forther on page 10 line page
 
03:15:44.349 --> 03:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
10 line 16 same issue uh line oh yep
 
03:15:44.359 --> 03:15:45.269 align:start position:0%
10 line 16 same issue uh line oh yep
there

03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
is um line 24 on page 10 theor with it
 
03:15:50.830 --> 03:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
but no that's fine that's fine Y and
 
03:15:52.189 --> 03:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
then on the next
 
03:15:54.910 --> 03:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
page oh it does use executive director
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
instead of board in the two places on
 
03:15:58.950 --> 03:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
line 11 it's not consistent somebody
 
03:16:00.670 --> 03:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to go and whacko aess up
 
03:16:03.070 --> 03:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
the side of the head but their lowercase
 
03:16:05.469 --> 03:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
here and they were all board and
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
executive director where uppercase in
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
instance hang hang on no no this is one
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that written it once they took
 
03:16:17.150 --> 03:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
the Lang no no I don't think that's the
 
03:16:21.910 --> 03:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
issue so okay so which ones the very
 
03:16:25.229 --> 03:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
first instance back on page eight okay
 
03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
page eight line 33 line
 
03:16:32.750 --> 03:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
whoops um
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
yeah was that it no that 33 that page 8
 
03:16:39.469 --> 03:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
33 right I think you're saying page 8
 
03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
line 33 executive director capitalize
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
throughout it is
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
lowerre there's a very specific reason
 
03:16:48.469 --> 03:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
for that that I can't tell it's in a
 
03:16:50.750 --> 03:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
title it's in the title of the section
 
03:16:55.229 --> 03:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
so it's capitalized thank you all right
 
03:16:55.239 --> 03:16:57.790 align:start position:0%
so it's capitalized thank you all right
um

03:16:57.790 --> 03:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:02.030 --> 03:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
so um okay people can look through and
 
03:17:04.590 --> 03:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
are there do we just
 
03:17:07.670 --> 03:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
change instead of saying board to office
 
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
um board to executive director in all
 
03:17:09.880 --> 03:17:10.670 align:start position:0%
um board to executive director in all
those

03:17:10.670 --> 03:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:17:13.389 --> 03:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
places I'm thinking the answer is yes
 
03:17:15.150 --> 03:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes well know I'm only looking at this
 
03:17:20.429 --> 03:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
one and as we go through the other ones
 
03:17:22.269 --> 03:17:22.279 align:start position:0%
if we find similar problems we'll deal
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
with them then I'm sure there are
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
similar problems I'm sure there are so
 
03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
just say we're going to do that for 46 I
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'm insisting as chair we're going to do
 
03:17:33.030 --> 03:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
it this way because there's only so much
 
03:17:35.990 --> 03:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
I can deal with in one chunk one last
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
clarification about the term yeah so is
 
03:17:43.309 --> 03:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
there a difference between the statutary
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
board versus uh Advisory board if there
 
03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
is less than six months left if somebody
 
03:17:55.309 --> 03:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
resigns almost at the end of the
 
03:18:01.710 --> 03:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
term to be replaced or you know um more
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
than six months
 
03:18:07.189 --> 03:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
left we usually just replace them as as
 
03:18:09.110 --> 03:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
they resign I mean it typically takes
 
03:18:12.670 --> 03:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
time to replace them um
 
03:18:14.550 --> 03:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
but we just replace we
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
just okay I'm not sure if that answers
 
03:18:19.150 --> 03:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
your question I'm sorry
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative there's no difference
 
03:18:21.359 --> 03:18:24.150 align:start position:0%
representative there's no difference
thank

03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
you okay I don't know that we need take
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any objection in the
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
section on family mediators to change um
 
03:18:34.389 --> 03:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know where it go where it currently
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
goes from office just board to office to
 
03:18:37.550 --> 03:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
executive director are there any
 
03:18:40.710 --> 03:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
objections okay I don't think we need to
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
actually record a vote or anything
 
03:18:44.510 --> 03:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
so when I put a final Amendment together
 
03:18:48.750 --> 03:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
I made a note we'll do that okay cool
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
um so I think we've gone through this
 
03:18:52.439 --> 03:18:53.349 align:start position:0%
um so I think we've gone through this
we've

03:18:53.349 --> 03:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
discussed the big issue which is well
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
making advisory and also the
 
03:19:00.750 --> 03:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
appointments to the
 
03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.389 --> 03:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
um okay and so I'm uh looking for a
 
03:19:16.189 --> 03:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.349 --> 03:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
we accept the changes made in this
 
03:19:25.950 --> 03:19:25.960 align:start position:0%

03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
1271 to section 12 family mediators
 
03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
board hang on it's it's actually
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
multiple sections hang but but line you
 
03:19:39.510 --> 03:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
can just say if you want starting page
 
03:19:42.870 --> 03:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
six line 19
 
03:19:45.389 --> 03:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
through 1118
 
03:19:50.670 --> 03:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
through Page 11 line
 
03:19:55.590 --> 03:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
five um let me see if that's right I had
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%

03:20:10.429 --> 03:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
18 and we have to have those parts in
 
03:20:13.309 --> 03:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
because they're changing the RSA r
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%

six
[Music]

03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:20:36.670 --> 03:20:36.680 align:start position:0%

03:20:42.750 --> 03:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
19 no page page six page six line 19
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah page six line 19 page 11 page

11
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
line 18 18 that's it's confusing so
 
03:20:56.429 --> 03:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
changes with the changes uh discussed
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
discussed and and voted on and so you
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
know the final version will be after we
 
03:21:06.910 --> 03:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
do the final dealing with the the
 
03:21:06.920 --> 03:21:08.030 align:start position:0%
do the final dealing with the the
purpose

03:21:08.030 --> 03:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
language um okay good
 
03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thanks to representative
 
03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
goul for suggesting we move forward yes
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to hear we've also moved
 
03:21:21.960 --> 03:21:21.970 align:start position:0%
on from repealing repeals to amending
 
03:21:21.970 --> 03:21:25.349 align:start position:0%
on from repealing repeals to amending
[Laughter]

03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:21:29.349 --> 03:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
amendments ah okay um so do we want to
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
continue on through another one yes so
 
03:21:33.990 --> 03:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
anyone have an issue with doing that
 
03:21:37.030 --> 03:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay that would start and that then is
 
03:21:40.030 --> 03:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
Page anybody have a problem with that I
 
03:21:41.550 --> 03:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to keep people from food if
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
they need need it and all that I'm good
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
okay um I'll give you a moment on that
 
03:21:50.550 --> 03:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to push people past
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
what's a good
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
idea um so this is Page 11 line
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
19 through Page
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
20 um line 15 if I'm correct
 
03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
11 to page 20 line 15 this is a
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
big um chunk that's correct and
 
03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
um so and thank you for going through
 
03:22:19.150 --> 03:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
and looking at more detailed markup than
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
I did I appreciate it what I got to do
 
03:22:25.389 --> 03:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
my brain all right so um just looking at
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
this starting at page 11 at the
 
03:22:31.269 --> 03:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
beginning page 11 uh line uh
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
line um
 
03:22:37.110 --> 03:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
19 okay so the first part down
 
03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
here it's what does it say
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
adding one correction
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
yeah page 20 what line did you say it it
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
lines 15 I believe yep
 
03:22:53.950 --> 03:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
yep starts
 
03:22:57.550 --> 03:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
right so um so at the beginning of this
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:22:59.399 --> 03:23:01.990 align:start position:0%
the first
section

03:23:01.990 --> 03:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:23:05.269 --> 03:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
um says so it makes advising the
 
03:23:07.510 --> 03:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
executive director concerning
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
implementation chapter there's another
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
reduced Workforce barriers and the edce
 
03:23:14.670 --> 03:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce barriers which I will we'll
 
03:23:16.189 --> 03:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with but I'll come up with a
 
03:23:17.710 --> 03:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
proposal limiting
 
03:23:17.720 --> 03:23:22.030 align:start position:0%
proposal limiting
that

03:23:22.030 --> 03:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:24.910 --> 03:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
um rule it's got the part rules
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
inexistent will remain in effect until
 
03:23:30.630 --> 03:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
repealed repealed by the executive
 
03:23:32.830 --> 03:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
director of the so do you can repeal
 
03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
them is that like okay the ru making
 
03:23:39.550 --> 03:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
Authority would transfer to us so we
 
03:23:41.830 --> 03:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
would have to repeal the old boards
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
rules so this basically just says
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
whatever rules are in existence stay in
 
03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
existence until we take action on them
 
03:23:49.309 --> 03:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
okay and that action presumably would be
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
proposing updated rules appeals and then
 
03:23:54.150 --> 03:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
you have to go through the whole 541a
 
03:23:57.309 --> 03:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
thing correct okay just a quick thought
 
03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
y Mr chair sure think in uh trying to
 
03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the workforce barrier and making
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
this smooth I hope we won't burn burn
 
03:24:09.790 --> 03:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
out giving all the
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility director Court
 
03:24:13.510 --> 03:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to we're going to
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
have to have discussion on the
 
03:24:16.229 --> 03:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee about that I think we're
 
03:24:18.030 --> 03:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
done today with that one but I don't
 
03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
think yeah I don't think that's going to
 
03:24:21.630 --> 03:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
Happ that's not and it doesn't change
 
03:24:22.950 --> 03:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
that taking whether we leave that
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
language out or take it in does not
 
03:24:26.910 --> 03:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
change anything I think and correct me
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
about her job or what oplc does or
 
03:24:33.630 --> 03:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
anything no although if you want to
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
raise my salary I'd be happy to accept
 
03:24:39.070 --> 03:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
that statutory change um that that's my
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
job on a different committee I am
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairing uh The Joint Committee on
 
03:24:45.150 --> 03:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
employee classification oh wonderful but
 
03:24:47.269 --> 03:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
but you'd have to you'd have to so are
 
03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
you the department head for that are you
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
under something else yes you'd have to
 
03:24:52.590 --> 03:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
come and present a and go to the
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
consultant get a recommendation and then
 
03:24:57.389 --> 03:24:57.399 align:start position:0%
I but with my different hat on I'd have
 
03:25:02.229 --> 03:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
to consider that no didn't no no uh uh
 
03:25:04.030 --> 03:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
there's the conflict of interest no I'm
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
just no no I'm not going to be paying
 
03:25:09.510 --> 03:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
myself and I'm not and I'm not
 
03:25:11.910 --> 03:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
individually making the whole payment so
 
03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's diffuse enough so she's out
 
03:25:16.030 --> 03:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm still in right I just want to be
 
03:25:19.229 --> 03:25:19.239 align:start position:0%
clear I have no conflict I'm
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
not I'm I'm not uh indicating my view on
 
03:25:25.189 --> 03:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
any of that right now different
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
hat okay sorry I you have to it's
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon we getting a little silly but
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
um okay so I think if everybody is uh is
 
03:25:36.469 --> 03:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
okay with
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding um all right the next we get
 
03:25:40.870 --> 03:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
to the usual thing was the board
 
03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
to the usual thing was the board
membership

03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:47.790 --> 03:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
and this is drastic uh yeah so could you
 
03:25:49.710 --> 03:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
give us an overview of the membership
 
03:25:51.189 --> 03:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
change and then we can look at it I
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
suppose in some
 
03:25:56.070 --> 03:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
detail yeah so currently there are many
 
03:26:00.910 --> 03:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
many members on the guardian atlm board
 
03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:02.750 align:start position:0%
many members on the guardian atlm board
um

03:26:02.750 --> 03:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
and at least in the recent history this
 
03:26:08.910 --> 03:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
board has had issues with Quorum he only
 
03:26:13.910 --> 03:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
met two times last year um um so as
 
03:26:17.309 --> 03:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
proposed this is reducing the membership
 
03:26:19.189 --> 03:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
to three individuals consistent with how
 
03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is from other advisory boards and
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
would be removing the legislatively
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
appointed members So currently there are
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the president of
 
03:26:30.030 --> 03:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate and by the
 
03:26:33.150 --> 03:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
speaker um the executive director of the
 
03:26:35.189 --> 03:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
judicial Council also has a seat on the
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
board and so this uh bill is proposing
 
03:26:39.550 --> 03:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
03:26:42.269 --> 03:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
that um just are there any other boards
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
that have members appointed by the uh
 
03:26:46.269 --> 03:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
president of the senate or speaker of
 
03:26:49.790 --> 03:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
the house it's it's fairly rare we do
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
have we do have a couple of other boards
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately are not coming to my
 
03:26:57.070 --> 03:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
mind right now that's okay just but we
 
03:26:58.870 --> 03:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
do have a couple of other ones I will
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
say we don't currently have a House
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
member appointed which is which is a
 
03:27:06.429 --> 03:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
problem part of the
 
03:27:09.429 --> 03:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
problem um again one member of Casa
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
changing it from being appointed by the
 
03:27:13.790 --> 03:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
governor to the executive director which
 
03:27:17.550 --> 03:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
is consistent with uh advisory boards
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
and then um one member of eliminating
 
03:27:23.469 --> 03:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
the DCF member um appointed by the
 
03:27:26.630 --> 03:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
governor and then
 
03:27:30.269 --> 03:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's I was wondering
 
03:27:35.070 --> 03:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
so and also the the member of DCF or
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
representing them or Casey Family
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
Services is that what is Casey no Casey
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
Casey is um
 
03:27:44.429 --> 03:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
um basically an entity don't correct me
 
03:27:46.590 --> 03:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong but that contracts with DCF
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
to provide certain services so they're
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
basically a private outfit that we
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
contract with that's my yeah they're not
 
03:27:54.910 --> 03:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
a state body correct okay that seems a
 
03:27:57.309 --> 03:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
little but miss
 
03:27:59.950 --> 03:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh and and let me I'm trying to get
 
03:28:01.469 --> 03:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
through this and then we go to other
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
people so with the board
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
membership I'm I really
 
03:28:09.510 --> 03:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
please please suspend I want to get
 
03:28:11.870 --> 03:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
through this and then I'll go to you if
 
03:28:13.750 --> 03:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
if that I mean because you're
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
interrupting the stuff I'm trying to do
 
03:28:17.590 --> 03:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
here so thank
 
03:28:19.950 --> 03:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
you I'm just I a series of questions
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
about these things and then I'll move on
 
03:28:24.750 --> 03:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
so what is actually court appointed
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
special Advocates one member of that
 
03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
what is that organization or whatever it
 
03:28:33.870 --> 03:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
is Doug do you want to chime in they're
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
the they're essentially the major entity
 
03:28:39.950 --> 03:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
that um trains and
 
03:28:43.870 --> 03:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
trains guard at Liams and then contracts
 
03:28:46.510 --> 03:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
with the court uh to provide G's and
 
03:28:48.910 --> 03:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
cases is that a New Hampshire outfit or
 
03:28:51.269 --> 03:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
national or I think they're National but
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
they have they have a New Hampshire but
 
03:28:54.990 --> 03:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to misspeak but I think
 
03:28:58.110 --> 03:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding aren't they the
 
03:29:01.070 --> 03:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
advocates for children in court and
 
03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:02.229 align:start position:0%
advocates for children in court and
their

03:29:02.229 --> 03:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:29:05.229 --> 03:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
publicly that's the guardian please we
 
03:29:07.309 --> 03:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
would have to go to recognizing people I
 
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
we've been pretty pre-form and I'm
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
normally okay with that but I'm just
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
trying talking about the C CA I'm asking
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
you not to speak until you're recognized
 
03:29:18.670 --> 03:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
which I really don't want to have to do
 
03:29:22.510 --> 03:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
but um and then the the the large
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
section here
 
03:29:26.710 --> 03:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
removed oh you're taking the public the
 
03:29:28.110 --> 03:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
rest of this is about public members
 
03:29:30.510 --> 03:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
from lines 12 to
 
03:29:30.520 --> 03:29:32.110 align:start position:0%
from lines 12 to
18

03:29:32.110 --> 03:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
18
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
um and the removing members of board
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
should serve without compensation is cu
 
03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
they do receive a per DM okay how how
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
much is that by the way this is It's
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
nominal it's $25 for them thank
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
you um and I'm just going to get through
 
03:29:51.429 --> 03:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
the rest of this all members of they
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
shall be New Hampshire residents fine
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
and what's so each appointment should be
 
03:29:59.349 --> 03:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
valid for three years to a successor the
 
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
term the member of Casa shall expire if
 
03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:03.560 align:start position:0%

03:30:05.670 --> 03:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
so they're not they're not
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
eligible no more than two terms and if
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're d uh yeah
 
03:30:14.990 --> 03:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
actually that's right um where is that
 
03:30:17.870 --> 03:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
here so on line 23 on page 12 should
 
03:30:21.309 --> 03:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
that be full terms to full terms yes
 
03:30:24.830 --> 03:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
that let's see I got to make a
 
03:30:31.630 --> 03:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
note page 12 I end up leaving or
 
03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
note page 12 I end up leaving or
not

03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
L okay um all right I'm I'm done I was
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to get through all of this
 
03:30:43.990 --> 03:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
and see how it worked so represent
 
03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
maputi two points removing
 
03:30:47.720 --> 03:30:50.150 align:start position:0%
maputi two points removing
dcyf

03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
03:30:52.990 --> 03:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
and the part of
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
the Guardian at leam Advisory Board
 
03:31:01.910 --> 03:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
pertains to a lot of that with the dcyf
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
cases and public and children and Kasa
 
03:31:10.309 --> 03:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
is also part of children being an
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
advocate and I think not having
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
representation from dcyf
 
03:31:22.269 --> 03:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
or giving the whole thing to Kasa I
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
would say the checks and balances are
 
03:31:27.070 --> 03:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
imbalanced so we won't take a position
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
on that but one thing I would note is
 
03:31:31.150 --> 03:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
that in a court case right the G is
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be neutral and is is
 
03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
basically going out to get the
 
03:31:36.950 --> 03:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
information on behalf of the Court DCF
 
03:31:38.590 --> 03:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
is one party to the case and then you
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
have the parent so if you're going to
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
have CF you don't have somebody
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
representing the parents interests that
 
03:31:46.389 --> 03:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
may be something for you to consider I
 
03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
don't think it's personally necessary in
 
03:31:50.349 --> 03:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with ler because really the
 
03:31:52.990 --> 03:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
question is are they minimally competent
 
03:31:56.309 --> 03:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
and you have G's on The Advisory board
 
03:31:58.670 --> 03:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
that can help make that determination so
 
03:32:02.189 --> 03:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
we're not really talking about um big
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
picture you know the role of the G in
 
03:32:06.189 --> 03:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
the court system that's just something
 
03:32:07.950 --> 03:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
you may want to consider because it
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
could be considered lopsided
 
03:32:16.469 --> 03:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
all right so my point is not out out
 
03:32:19.790 --> 03:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
there I I see it as a lopsided or not
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
fairly balanced yep you mean lopsided
 
03:32:26.189 --> 03:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
now or lopsided if DCF are on I was just
 
03:32:28.510 --> 03:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
saying that if you have DCF without the
 
03:32:31.150 --> 03:32:31.160 align:start position:0%
parent I mean because DCF is a party to
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
the case yes parent you know the parent
 
03:32:35.910 --> 03:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
is the party to the case the G is kind
 
03:32:37.910 --> 03:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
of in the Middle where the judge sits so
 
03:32:39.870 --> 03:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
if you add the DCF and don't have a
 
03:32:41.550 --> 03:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
parent representative one can make the
 
03:32:43.030 --> 03:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
argument that you're not fully
 
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
represented in the trifecta of the court
 
03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
case and if I just a moment and and as
 
03:32:52.990 --> 03:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
as it's in this bill do you think it's
 
03:32:56.750 --> 03:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:59.269 --> 03:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
not um well you've got essentially two
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
G's and a member of the court I I think
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
that those people are part of the
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
neutral um position in a courtroom so
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
you can start adding on different people
 
03:33:14.309 --> 03:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
to represent different
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
perspectives but you would want to make
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
sure you capture them equally would be
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
my recommendation representative Brown
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
so I thank you Mr chair your casa
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
Advocate is supposed to
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
be neutral between parents and dcyf for
 
03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
the children if I'm remembering that
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
correctly correct so they're they're a
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
neutral Advocate that that's their
 
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's their their job basically to do
 
03:33:41.110 --> 03:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that for the kids right so I think
 
03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a fair one to have in
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
there okay uh representative gold thank
 
03:33:49.469 --> 03:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:33:53.790 --> 03:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
question having this been my
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%

03:34:00.990 --> 03:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
decades so I understand the casa can you
 
03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
explain to me what one member
 
03:34:04.389 --> 03:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of Guardian
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
at items
 
03:34:09.870 --> 03:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
is I honestly don't know um and I
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
currently don't make the appointments so
 
03:34:14.790 --> 03:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
I find that a little strange the way
 
03:34:17.189 --> 03:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's currently worded it's bizarre
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't mean necessarily that
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
the person is a j no it could be anybody
 
03:34:24.429 --> 03:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
representing their interests I would
 
03:34:26.830 --> 03:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
suggest maybe making the change to just
 
03:34:26.840 --> 03:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
suggest maybe making the change to just
one

03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
gal so here's here's what I would say
 
03:34:36.670 --> 03:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
about this historically we didn't have
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
cassa and cassa came along and they are
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
an international organiz I mean mean a
 
03:34:42.990 --> 03:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
National Organization or they they're
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
bigger than New Hampshire it's not a
 
03:34:47.150 --> 03:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
local group they do train Guardian Ed
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
items from
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers prior to that we had all
 
03:34:54.750 --> 03:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers so the parents had a lawyer the
 
03:34:56.469 --> 03:34:56.479 align:start position:0%
state had a lawyer and the kid had a
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
lawyer and the kids lawyer the guardian
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
at lium was appointed to represent the
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
child's best interest with full legal
 
03:35:07.950 --> 03:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge and understanding of the law
 
03:35:11.309 --> 03:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
cassa provided a much cheaper
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
alternative of people who did not
 
03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
understand the law and the child lost
 
03:35:18.429 --> 03:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
their legal representation that was
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
focused only on them and if you think
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
I'm biased I think I just made it clear
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
I was
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so cassa has worked really hard
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's loved it a lot of us
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
have shut up and moved on but this other
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
member I would ask there are still
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys who judges do appoint and very
 
03:35:42.830 --> 03:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
specialized cases that are complicated
 
03:35:45.790 --> 03:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
that really need an attorney and I would
 
03:35:48.990 --> 03:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
request that that person
 
03:35:53.550 --> 03:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
be a practicing gal who is an attorney
 
03:35:55.910 --> 03:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and is independent from cassa so we
 
03:35:58.389 --> 03:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
don't just get two CA
 
03:36:00.750 --> 03:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers on
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
there makes sense to me if you're asking
 
03:36:06.510 --> 03:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
my opinion um could you suggest some
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
exact language if we were to do that yes
 
03:36:11.229 --> 03:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
we can definitely put together some
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
draft language okay I'm I don't have an
 
03:36:16.910 --> 03:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
objection to that represent
 
03:36:22.030 --> 03:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
M you um this is the question to uh
 
03:36:24.830 --> 03:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
director Courtney you said there are um
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
te members currently on the board you
 
03:36:30.990 --> 03:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
didn't give me exact number but I in my
 
03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
notes I have seven member board is it
 
03:36:35.670 --> 03:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
seven member currently or going to a
 
03:36:39.030 --> 03:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
seven member board I have counted nine
 
03:36:46.710 --> 03:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh represent M py followup
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
going from 9 to
 
03:36:58.910 --> 03:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
3 with predominantly being Family and
 
03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:00.510 align:start position:0%
3 with predominantly being Family and
Child

03:37:00.510 --> 03:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
Child
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
Welfare that would be a drastic cut I
 
03:37:03.680 --> 03:37:06.550 align:start position:0%
Welfare that would be a drastic cut I
would

03:37:06.550 --> 03:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
think um I
 
03:37:11.950 --> 03:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
get um representative
 
03:37:14.910 --> 03:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
G the other piece I didn't speak to but
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
it it follows exactly what uh
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative ma maputi was just
 
03:37:20.279 --> 03:37:21.469 align:start position:0%
representative ma maputi was just
referring

03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
referring
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
to is that like the dcyf uh position
 
03:37:30.150 --> 03:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
like so a lot of these positions were um
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
agency or legislative kind of positions
 
03:37:38.510 --> 03:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
and especially with the DCF U person
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
when you have people that this is part
 
03:37:43.030 --> 03:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
of their job it limits when you're able
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
to meet and so then it can make it
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
scheduling really
 
03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
difficult um and I do agree with the the
 
03:37:53.429 --> 03:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
notion because DCF in my experience also
 
03:37:56.670 --> 03:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
can have favorite guardian of items that
 
03:37:58.990 --> 03:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
tend to side with them that they would
 
03:38:01.710 --> 03:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
want to um see get appointed and what
 
03:38:04.110 --> 03:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
have you or you know it it it could skew
 
03:38:07.229 --> 03:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
things and then I mean I personally
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
would love to be on that as a
 
03:38:11.309 --> 03:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
legislative appointee and yet there's a
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
lot of things I'd love to do I don't
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
know how much time I have and um yeah I
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
just these are advisory boards I think
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
part of it is that when it was a
 
03:38:23.590 --> 03:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory board or a statutory board
 
03:38:26.189 --> 03:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
having a lot of those on there made some
 
03:38:29.550 --> 03:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
sense but I can see where um eliminating
 
03:38:32.910 --> 03:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
some of those and then the judicial Appo
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
appointees I mean I don't know I you can
 
03:38:38.110 --> 03:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
probably speak better to that than I can
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
about whether they need to be there I I
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
think because it's not regulatory you
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
certainly as taking over a lot of these
 
03:38:47.309 --> 03:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
responsibilities can reach out to any
 
03:38:49.189 --> 03:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
one of these people and get information
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
as you need it is that
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
correct yes that's
 
03:38:57.469 --> 03:38:57.479 align:start position:0%
correct so um one for director Courtney
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
um so this board is going to act as an
 
03:39:02.189 --> 03:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
advisor to
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
oplc and I guess the the question
 
03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
is do you see
 
03:39:11.389 --> 03:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
um right now if we go through this it'
 
03:39:13.750 --> 03:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
be three one would be uh representing
 
03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court one would be the casa
 
03:39:17.840 --> 03:39:18.630 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court one would be the casa
uh

03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
person um and one would be if we make
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
the change somebody who's an active
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
Guardian lium who's not part of Casa um
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
does that do you think that was is a
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
good mix to provide the advice needed is
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
there somebody an addition or
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
different you know because you you you
 
03:39:39.870 --> 03:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
weren't express some weren't sure about
 
03:39:42.990 --> 03:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
the the one pointed by the Supreme Court
 
03:39:46.349 --> 03:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
or I I I think that's uh sufficient for
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
us to work with I mean I think to
 
03:39:50.269 --> 03:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
represent of ghouls point I can always
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
reach out to DCF to get their input or
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
the HHS commissioner and or other
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
judicial you know the judicial Council
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
we do speak on other things so I think I
 
03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
think that's sufficient for us to get
 
03:40:05.229 --> 03:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
the expertise needed again what these
 
03:40:07.189 --> 03:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
boards are doing is pretty limited it's
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
really just establishing the
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
requirements to get certified
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think we need I don't
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
think we need much more than what's in
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
there or more than what's in there just
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
a moment represent G are you do you
 
03:40:23.389 --> 03:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
agree I mean having with the change you
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to the guardian of liem one is
 
03:40:26.429 --> 03:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with this I feel
 
03:40:28.189 --> 03:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
like that's a balanced
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
representation and yeah I'm comfortable
 
03:40:33.790 --> 03:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
with it and I feel like with this
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the change of
 
03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
the duties from regulatory to advisory I
 
03:40:41.309 --> 03:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
think it gives her a good Advisory Group
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
they can look at complaints that come in
 
03:40:45.189 --> 03:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
you've got a balanced view looking at
 
03:40:48.429 --> 03:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
that and then um you can reach out for
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
advice from anybody I'm comfortable with
 
03:40:52.469 --> 03:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr okay and do you still
 
03:40:53.790 --> 03:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
have a question represent
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
mapy yeah I I just still feel that
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
narrowing it and yes uh director
 
03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
Courtney can reach out but it's not
 
03:41:08.189 --> 03:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
anywhere required for you to do that
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
right you can make a decision on that
 
03:41:12.990 --> 03:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
particular thing to say I don't need to
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
I have the expertise so they again I'm
 
03:41:17.910 --> 03:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the checks and balances are
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
we shifting responsibility from one to
 
03:41:25.149 --> 03:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
another and not overlooking so are there
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular members that are being
 
03:41:31.149 --> 03:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
removed that you think should be back on
 
03:41:34.590 --> 03:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
or is it just the total number or I I
 
03:41:36.910 --> 03:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
would like to see a
 
03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
representation from the dcyf or the
 
03:41:43.990 --> 03:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
parent group that could have at least
 
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
five member board could give you that
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility these are three core people
 
03:41:53.189 --> 03:41:53.199 align:start position:0%
that we need to get and the other two
 
03:41:59.309 --> 03:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
can be an offsetting balancing to hold
 
03:42:02.429 --> 03:42:02.439 align:start position:0%
checks and balances okay and to my thank
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
you and to director
 
03:42:10.030 --> 03:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
Courtney um were there problems um
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
finding it's got two let say let's say
 
03:42:13.550 --> 03:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
we went
 
03:42:16.790 --> 03:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
to adding back in the DCF person
 
03:42:18.110 --> 03:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
although I have questions about this
 
03:42:21.790 --> 03:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
cast thing but Casey but and then add
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
let's say um one one member I'll get to
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
one member of the general public were
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
there problems in the past with finding
 
03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
members of the general public who uh
 
03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
meet these you know what what was in the
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
in statute now actually yeah no I think
 
03:42:40.830 --> 03:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
if you eliminate the legislative
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
positions you're probably going to solve
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
most of the Quorum problems and the
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
03:42:47.950 --> 03:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
judicial councel we already have
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who's being appointed by the
 
03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:50.309 align:start position:0%
somebody who's being appointed by the
Supreme

03:42:50.309 --> 03:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
Court so um I'm
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
not okay and I have a question then if
 
03:42:57.630 --> 03:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
we were to put back in one member
 
03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative DCF or Casey Family
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
Services or another child protective
 
03:43:06.550 --> 03:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
agency um appointed by the governor but
 
03:43:09.389 --> 03:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
I mean it it seems to imply Casey's an
 
03:43:12.349 --> 03:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
agency of the government which or state
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
agency which are they no no I don't
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
think so I'm assuming they're not no
 
03:43:18.990 --> 03:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
they they do contract with the state but
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
they're I I would probably limit it to
 
03:43:21.760 --> 03:43:23.309 align:start position:0%
they're I I would probably limit it to
DCF

03:43:23.309 --> 03:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
DCF
 
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
okay um just or yeah what's it I get get
 
03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:34.070 align:start position:0%
okay um just or yeah what's it I get get
to

03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.880 --> 03:43:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
protction

03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.910 --> 03:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.269 --> 03:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
answer I just don't have too many
 
03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
threats so case service operating
 
03:43:58.590 --> 03:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
Foundation ring the for frost yeah
 
03:44:07.630 --> 03:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
right so do we have
 
03:44:12.750 --> 03:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
I we were just discussing that if he
 
03:44:15.389 --> 03:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
left the um if he eliminated their
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
reference to Casey Family Services but
 
03:44:19.630 --> 03:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
but cap the reference to another Child
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency in the state that
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
could be some catchall language in the
 
03:44:27.429 --> 03:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
event that you know DC have changes his
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
name or what you know what have
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
you I'm I'm not I'm just still in I'm
 
03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
I'm exploring something here and I I
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
intend to get back to you and whoever
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
else um but I think Bailey um okay and
 
03:44:42.960 --> 03:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
else um but I think Bailey um okay and
then

03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
um there's you know appointed by the
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
governor if we does it going back to
 
03:44:51.469 --> 03:44:51.479 align:start position:0%
that would that make sense for if we
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
keep this one so so if it is a member of
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
DCF you you don't necessarily need an
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
appointment um if it's an Advisory Board
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
you I what I would say is probably the
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
director of the division of uh children
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
Youth and families or
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
designate okay all right we'll we'll
 
03:45:16.189 --> 03:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
come back to this first uh
 
03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey's had a question
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
pending and then representative goul did
 
03:45:23.670 --> 03:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
I well earlier on in all the discussion
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
we' had it sounded as if Guardian this
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
is a licensed Guardian ad lims and they
 
03:45:32.349 --> 03:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
were supposed to be the middle party the
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
parents were on one side and dcyf was on
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
the other and this is the middle party
 
03:45:40.429 --> 03:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
licensing them what the hell does DCF
 
03:45:42.189 --> 03:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
have to do with that they're one of the
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
opponents rather opposed of the middle
 
03:45:46.910 --> 03:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
party unless you can find some way to
 
03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
put in parents we do if you look at the
 
03:45:52.149 --> 03:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
language starting in line 12 on p on 12
 
03:45:55.910 --> 03:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
line 12 on page 12 there was U members
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
of the public and if certainly if we had
 
03:45:59.910 --> 03:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
DCF back in we'd have to add at least
 
03:46:02.149 --> 03:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
one of these back in yeah I agree with
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative gold so um
 
03:46:07.990 --> 03:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
one of my points was going to be the
 
03:46:10.830 --> 03:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
public member if we go this route should
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
be it should be stipulated that they're
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
parent if you look at it at the language
 
03:46:19.590 --> 03:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
that struck out but isn't um it's a
 
03:46:21.309 --> 03:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
public member representing the interest
 
03:46:22.750 --> 03:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
of those individuals receiving the
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
services the guardian liem appointed by
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
the governor and then there's what they
 
03:46:29.910 --> 03:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
can't be I mean they can't have been
 
03:46:33.429 --> 03:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
currently or be Guardian Liam or spouse
 
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
or they can't have a material financial
 
03:46:37.830 --> 03:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
interest in Guardian items or attacked
 
03:46:40.590 --> 03:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
or actively directed directly related to
 
03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
their services including the
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
representation the board or its pres
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
okay so you can look at that language
 
03:46:49.309 --> 03:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
and see if you're happy with the current
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
standat okay just I just was mentioning
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
that more
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
importantly I'm not sure CA is from
 
03:46:59.309 --> 03:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
Casey Family Services no they're
 
03:47:03.070 --> 03:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
different different different yeah so
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
where where is Casey Family Services
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
referenced in here it it's on uh line
 
03:47:12.790 --> 03:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
eight at the end with the dzf yeah it's
 
03:47:15.269 --> 03:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
or okay wait minute line eight one
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
representing the division of children
 
03:47:19.750 --> 03:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
youth and families or Casey Family
 
03:47:21.950 --> 03:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
Services or another Child Protection
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
Agency in the state okay so
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
Casey they do a lot of like foster care
 
03:47:31.180 --> 03:47:31.190 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah so that would be
 
03:47:31.190 --> 03:47:33.030 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah so that would be
[Music]

03:47:33.030 --> 03:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:47:36.309 --> 03:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
um so you could do I wonder if that's
 
03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
what the focus is that professionals
 
03:47:40.990 --> 03:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
working with foster children so those
 
03:47:43.510 --> 03:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
are children who really are relying on
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
their Guardian I'd light them really
 
03:47:47.269 --> 03:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
relying the parents really aren't there
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
to advocate for them like um like a
 
03:47:53.229 --> 03:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
child that's still placed with their
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
family so should should we should the
 
03:47:58.790 --> 03:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
language say that a professional agency
 
03:48:01.550 --> 03:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
representing foster parents and just the
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
one last point before we move on would
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
be um and and representative maputi
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
brought this up dcyf is so stretched
 
03:48:12.550 --> 03:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
stretched with their responsibilities
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
that I want to make sure before we add
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
them back in take them out all of that
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
that we know what their position would
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
be on this just yeah and to that um
 
03:48:24.830 --> 03:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
given the current makeup of the board
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
right now is that person uh from DCF or
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
some other group Casey or some other
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is somebody who represents DCF
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
they but they're okay they work for DCF
 
03:48:38.469 --> 03:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know what represent means I
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if they currently were
 
03:48:40.640 --> 03:48:42.590 align:start position:0%
don't know if they currently were
[Music]

03:48:42.590 --> 03:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to check I don't know that
 
03:48:47.229 --> 03:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
they currently work for DCF I know that
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
they represent DCF okay represent Brown
 
03:48:53.870 --> 03:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
then uh M py thank you Mr chair so yes
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to be DCF or Casey or
 
03:49:00.149 --> 03:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
and this is the semantics thing another
 
03:49:02.070 --> 03:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
Child Protection Agency in the state I
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't think there is another the Child
 
03:49:06.269 --> 03:49:06.279 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency in the state what
 
03:49:07.389 --> 03:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
other than
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
DCF I know Easter seal was designated
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
under that category and they may still
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
be but are they are they actually an
 
03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
agency of the state yeah they're part of
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
state that have to be part of state
 
03:49:19.429 --> 03:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
government under some director no they
 
03:49:22.229 --> 03:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
have a c it's complicated but they
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're categorized as a Child
 
03:49:28.429 --> 03:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency it's wider it it was
 
03:49:31.149 --> 03:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
back it was a yeah the language doesn't
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
say that they are a State Child
 
03:49:34.510 --> 03:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency it says Child
 
03:49:36.870 --> 03:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency in the state so they
 
03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
could be eligible either Casey we could
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
take Casey out of you could take them
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
out and just leave another in this so
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
they' be eligible or this one she
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned could be or okay I know
 
03:49:50.349 --> 03:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
traditionally do you know has it
 
03:49:53.389 --> 03:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
generally been somebody from DCF yes it
 
03:49:56.110 --> 03:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
is currently somebody from DCF okay and
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
then follow representative yeah followup
 
03:50:02.429 --> 03:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
so I I I really need to do this for my
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
predecessor to this position that I am
 
03:50:07.229 --> 03:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
in The Honorable Ned Gordon who was here
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
former Senator and former representative
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
and former judge in New
 
03:50:17.309 --> 03:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um was opposed to this as you
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
remember quite
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
vehemently um what was he opposed to uh
 
03:50:24.269 --> 03:50:24.279 align:start position:0%
specifically he said the board was
 
03:50:26.550 --> 03:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
useful because back before the board
 
03:50:28.590 --> 03:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
existed there was about 25 gal's that
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
were never trained or qualified in any
 
03:50:32.189 --> 03:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
way whatsoever and there was no
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
repercussions of training now because
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
the board exists there is training and
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
standards uh that that he he said was a
 
03:50:44.590 --> 03:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
a good process um he said most of the
 
03:50:46.630 --> 03:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
seven members are involved in the gal
 
03:50:48.070 --> 03:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
process in one way or another which
 
03:50:51.870 --> 03:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense he also had issues with the
 
03:50:53.910 --> 03:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of reducing work fee barriers
 
03:50:56.189 --> 03:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
language which we have addressed I
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
believe um he did
 
03:51:03.790 --> 03:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
say and and maybe oplc could follow up
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
that there's currently 20 complaints
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
going back to February I think you
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
talked about this that day director
 
03:51:08.640 --> 03:51:09.870 align:start position:0%
talked about this that day director
Courtney

03:51:09.870 --> 03:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that oplc had no answer to those
 
03:51:13.950 --> 03:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
complaints at least that's my cryptic
 
03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
notes here um and now because there
 
03:51:19.389 --> 03:51:19.399 align:start position:0%
three members only I think his if I'm
 
03:51:22.309 --> 03:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
remembering his his thought was if
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's that many complaints the three
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
members wouldn't be able to manage that
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't director Courtney yeah
 
03:51:29.870 --> 03:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:51:32.110 --> 03:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
respond to that um first of all this
 
03:51:34.510 --> 03:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
board has met twice um in the last year
 
03:51:36.790 --> 03:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
I believe and so that's a significant
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
issue with respect to the complaints
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
they have something that's somewhat
 
03:51:42.910 --> 03:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
unique in their statute which is that if
 
03:51:45.990 --> 03:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
we receive a complaint and it's about a
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
guardian ad item in a current Child
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
Protection case the board can't
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
investigate or do anything with the case
 
03:51:55.790 --> 03:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
until the family court dispositions the
 
03:51:59.349 --> 03:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
case and so that is why these cases
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
aren't moving forward now I understand
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
from a policy standpoint right because
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
in these cases you may have people that
 
03:52:07.149 --> 03:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
are motivated to file complaints um I
 
03:52:11.070 --> 03:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
get but at the same time it does extend
 
03:52:13.269 --> 03:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
the process for us to be able to review
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
the complaints and um and because we
 
03:52:19.830 --> 03:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
limit the ability because the board is
 
03:52:21.630 --> 03:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
the adjudicating body we limit the
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
ability of the board to understand where
 
03:52:26.550 --> 03:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
every case is in the process you know we
 
03:52:29.389 --> 03:52:29.399 align:start position:0%
give them general information but we
 
03:52:31.349 --> 03:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to give them specific
 
03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
information so that could be a source of
 
03:52:33.439 --> 03:52:34.750 align:start position:0%
information so that could be a source of
the

03:52:34.750 --> 03:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding followup follow up
 
03:52:38.349 --> 03:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
since I'm I'm talking about the
 
03:52:39.630 --> 03:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
honorable Ned Gord and we might as well
 
03:52:42.670 --> 03:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
go through that list
 
03:52:45.070 --> 03:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
um he did say now that if this will be
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
an Advisory Board what does that change
 
03:52:49.189 --> 03:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
in the role and I think we've talked
 
03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
about this nauseum this morning he's not
 
03:52:54.510 --> 03:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
sure what an Advisory Board would do uh
 
03:52:57.110 --> 03:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
only he thought only if oplc came to
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
them to ask for Rural review but I I
 
03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
think we've beaten this to death this
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
morning but just for the sake of
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
addressing it on online here well yeah I
 
03:53:10.149 --> 03:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
think we Tre our ADV boards very similar
 
03:53:12.790 --> 03:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
I mean the same as regular independent
 
03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies um but there is that
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
aspect of State supervision so we would
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
expect them to hold meetings and do the
 
03:53:23.070 --> 03:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
things that other boards do um reviewing
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
rules but also answering um questions
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
that require expert consultation
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
reviewing um reviewing reports of
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
investigation and then holding hearings
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
one last followup on that follow and
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
a a another representative on Edna asked
 
03:53:47.630 --> 03:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
the question of uh Mr
 
03:53:51.630 --> 03:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
Gordon how would the Advisory Board
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
improve what is happening because that
 
03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
member said he had no confidence in oplc
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
was the
 
03:54:01.630 --> 03:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
quote um and because oplc picks The
 
03:54:03.630 --> 03:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
Advisory board members as that a problem
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
and Mr Gordon said he thought that was a
 
03:54:09.790 --> 03:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
problem I'm just it hasn't been a
 
03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
problem from my perspective but of
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
course that's me saying that um you know
 
03:54:16.070 --> 03:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
I take issue with the not having
 
03:54:17.550 --> 03:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
confidence you know with a board that
 
03:54:20.510 --> 03:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
meets twice a year uh it's hard to know
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have a knowledge base to be
 
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
able to make that opinion would be my my
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
answer to that that's all thank you just
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
a a follow up on on that whole thing so
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
is the
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
backlog and dealing with complaints um
 
03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
all are largely due to the fact that
 
03:54:39.309 --> 03:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
they're tied up in court so you can't
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
proceed correct and where's the stat is
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
that Statute in here or is it under
 
03:54:48.030 --> 03:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else it I it is in their G
 
03:54:50.590 --> 03:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
statute which is what in this is it
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
dealt with in this amendment or is it
 
03:54:52.399 --> 03:54:55.510 align:start position:0%
dealt with in this amendment or is it
somewhere

03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.910 --> 03:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
else we're going to take a look I don't
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
think I didn't notice I didn't see it in
 
03:55:02.670 --> 03:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I wasn't as careful
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
with this all right representative
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
mipi thank you Mr chair uh couple of
 
03:55:11.830 --> 03:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
things one is Casey Family Services is a
 
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
foundation sponsored private agency
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
provided child welfare services in New
 
03:55:21.469 --> 03:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
England and Baltimore it focuses on
 
03:55:23.469 --> 03:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
lifelong Family Practice model to
 
03:55:25.710 --> 03:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
connect children and fostter care to
 
03:55:28.510 --> 03:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
enduring families so that's the fostter
 
03:55:32.550 --> 03:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
care aspect of it that dcyf deals with
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
both fostter care and reuniting with the
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
family members that's just the clar
 
03:55:41.790 --> 03:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
ification and I think keeping that KC
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
Family Services will serve that third
 
03:55:48.030 --> 03:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
group of
 
03:55:50.670 --> 03:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
children that are in foster care
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
long-term foster care so one one thing
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
which we kind of talked about um I'd
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
like to see your view on it
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
so we could take Casey Family Service as
 
03:56:03.309 --> 03:56:03.319 align:start position:0%
the explicit reference out leave in or
 
03:56:05.910 --> 03:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
another child protective agency in the
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
state and Casey someone from Casey would
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
be eligible as well as maybe some other
 
03:56:15.550 --> 03:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
one she mentioned so I wonder if you be
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
okay with that or does it specifically
 
03:56:18.870 --> 03:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
Casey from having been in the field
 
03:56:25.990 --> 03:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
Easter seal is used yes they are a
 
03:56:28.990 --> 03:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
provider for different you know I'm not
 
03:56:30.590 --> 03:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting them specifically but I don't
 
03:56:32.070 --> 03:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there are any others but
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
to not I mean we've it hasn't been a
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
problem but I've seen elsewhere in
 
03:56:38.229 --> 03:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
statute where you name a particular
 
03:56:40.670 --> 03:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
organization ation and they they could
 
03:56:43.070 --> 03:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
change their name or cease to exist and
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
then you got a promin statute that's
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking I would like to see
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
Child Protective Services or if that
 
03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:56.030 align:start position:0%
Child Protective Services or if that
encompasses

03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
both foster care because that's a whole
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
different group of kids that foster care
 
03:57:04.439 --> 03:57:06.550 align:start position:0%
different group of kids that foster care
versus

03:57:06.550 --> 03:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
versus
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
reunification uh family
 
03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
so that that that's a big issue in terms
 
03:57:15.670 --> 03:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
of so you prefer leaving Casey in there
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
names I I don't know of any other which
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
provides okay I'm not my my issue is not
 
03:57:23.469 --> 03:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
I don't know anything about them and
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
they may be wonderful I hope they are I
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
just I have an issue leaving name
 
03:57:31.950 --> 03:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
particular uh you know groups by name in
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
here which is led to problem um but
 
03:57:35.590 --> 03:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there there won't be a problem
 
03:57:39.790 --> 03:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so that one I just wanted to uh let
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
you know and my other thing was going
 
03:57:48.229 --> 03:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
back to my notes just before net Gordon
 
03:57:51.229 --> 03:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
was another private practitioner also on
 
03:57:54.189 --> 03:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire board Vicky Irvin who
 
03:57:57.670 --> 03:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
opposed this with the same caveat in
 
03:58:01.030 --> 03:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
terms of reducing the number of board
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
members and also the timeliness of
 
03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
response from the board and the
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
oplc that
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
was uh that was very similar to what uh
 
03:58:17.269 --> 03:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
net Gordon point of order there Mr Mr
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
Speaker I I had Nikki irin as
 
03:58:24.349 --> 03:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
acupuncturist H I had Vicky Vicky Irwin
 
03:58:27.269 --> 03:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
as an acupuncturist not about the g
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
board I don't she is on the acupuncture
 
03:58:32.710 --> 03:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
board right so that's a different topic
 
03:58:34.790 --> 03:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's my mistake I wrote it down as
 
03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
this one okay so going back to the board
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think putting the three respon all the
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to three board members we
 
03:58:48.670 --> 03:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
are looking at children and the welfare
 
03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
of the children and the future so I
 
03:58:51.720 --> 03:58:52.750 align:start position:0%
of the children and the future so I
would

03:58:52.750 --> 03:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
feel adding DCF or similar board and a
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
parent or even somebody who has gone
 
03:59:03.510 --> 03:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
through the foster care and aged out and
 
03:59:06.070 --> 03:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
is successful would be a wonderful
 
03:59:11.469 --> 03:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
appointee for that board um Ju Just okay
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative Brown so if we keep it as
 
03:59:17.070 --> 03:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
it exists which is in line 8 and line
 
03:59:20.349 --> 03:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
nine which we're deleting P it page 12
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
line 8 and nine so it hasn't happened
 
03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
yet but it could be that DCF would not
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
have a position on this board and it
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
could be someone for Casey Family
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
Services or Easter Seals or whatever and
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
no dcyf or some other CH Protection
 
03:59:39.790 --> 03:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
Agency and is that are we good with that
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
with DCF having potentially not having
 
03:59:46.110 --> 03:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
representation I'm good with that I am
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
too but eight and nine
 
03:59:55.710 --> 03:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
says or DCF or casy family or any other
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes so they will represent that's the
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
way it is today it is the way it is
 
04:00:01.870 --> 04:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
today okay but are we okay leaving DCF
 
04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
potentially the oras mean DCF might not
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
have a seat right I I certainly am okay
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm seven go to seven uh so
 
04:00:17.550 --> 04:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
three well from nine five well if we
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
took out B and C the Senate and the
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
house member right and I'd be okay
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
taking out well let's see so if we took
 
04:00:27.790 --> 04:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
out those three at the
 
04:00:32.229 --> 04:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
top um we so that the one from the
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
court um the uh the cassa uh person if
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
we put not the Casta or no I'm looking
 
04:00:44.830 --> 04:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
at so this is on line six on page 12
 
04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah are you saying to take that out I
 
04:00:49.830 --> 04:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
mean that's no no leave that in
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
no what cassa n cassa and Cassie family
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
Serv Cas no I'm talking about six and
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
seven right it says cassa we have to
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
keep cassa we keep down below Casey
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
Family Services is where we were going
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
to take the name out right so I I'm
 
04:01:08.510 --> 04:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
going I what I'm saying is I'm listen
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
the ones that would be in there and then
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
potential additions yep so cassa we
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
leave in we have the we have the one
 
04:01:15.550 --> 04:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
appointed by the Supreme Court y the
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
cassa one would be in there we're
 
04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
talking about adding back in the DCF or
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
eight and nine right three and and we
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
can further discussion as whether case's
 
04:01:31.550 --> 04:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
specifically listed or not um and then
 
04:01:34.910 --> 04:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
we'd have uh the guardian M Lim person
 
04:01:36.750 --> 04:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's four and then we would add back
 
04:01:39.110 --> 04:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
in one member of The General public who
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
is a parent with the same language
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's in here unless we want to change
 
04:01:44.110 --> 04:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
the language that's in statute think
 
04:01:45.550 --> 04:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul wants it to state
 
04:01:47.510 --> 04:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that person is a parent right yes
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
um okay but that that would be five
 
04:01:54.590 --> 04:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
which is I'm a good number so um just
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
kind of a procedural
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
thing Mr chair going back to this
 
04:02:02.830 --> 04:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
instead of saying one member eight and
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
nine one member representing the
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
division of Children
 
04:02:07.159 --> 04:02:08.790 align:start position:0%
division of Children
dcyf

04:02:08.790 --> 04:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
04:02:13.590 --> 04:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
and or Casey family or any other instead
 
04:02:18.309 --> 04:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
of doing one member can we do two two
 
04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
two issu I that way it gives you DCF as
 
04:02:26.389 --> 04:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
well as casy I don't I I wouldn't be
 
04:02:28.349 --> 04:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that and if we do that
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
to make it odd we'd have to add somebody
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
else maybe two members of the public or
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
something we have to stay odd because so
 
04:02:34.990 --> 04:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's not
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
ties um representative
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:39.349 align:start position:0%
ties um representative
Bailey

04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
Bailey
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
I think we began with a large board that
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
really met and had Quorum problems and I
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
think this is an inverse relationship
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
that the more people we add the more we
 
04:02:50.309 --> 04:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
get back to the original
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
problem agreed although we're looking at
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
going from three to five and instead of
 
04:02:58.630 --> 04:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
the original nine nine so it would be
 
04:03:00.590 --> 04:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
almost half of even with this addition
 
04:03:02.990 --> 04:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
it' be around half of what it
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
was you know I I take a point and I and
 
04:03:09.790 --> 04:03:09.800 align:start position:0%
I think that m to chair yeah if we if we
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
go to five then you know our our our
 
04:03:15.269 --> 04:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
former legislator and judge that that
 
04:03:17.189 --> 04:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
might assade some of his concerns about
 
04:03:22.429 --> 04:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
it going to three yeah W okay um and and
 
04:03:27.349 --> 04:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
can I just thank you Mr chair that uh in
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
line 8 and nine if we just remove
 
04:03:32.189 --> 04:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
everything and say A Child Protection
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
Agency one one member who represents a
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
Child Protection Agency in the state I
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
think that way that gives the choice and
 
04:03:43.550 --> 04:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the freedom and honestly for a lot
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
of parents just taking out
 
04:03:48.429 --> 04:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
DCF takes away a lot of The Angst and
 
04:03:48.439 --> 04:03:50.229 align:start position:0%
DCF takes away a lot of The Angst and
the

04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.149 --> 04:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
you and where's the public one the
 
04:04:00.189 --> 04:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
public one would be uh the part that
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
struck out we put back in line 12
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
through um
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
18 yeah well well so here I know you
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
want the
 
04:04:13.510 --> 04:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
parent um I think this stuff about not a
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
conflict and not so here here's what I'd
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
suggest we're talking about making a lot
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
of changes here I have some notes I'm
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
not sure they're entirely coherent um
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
would someone be willing to take on the
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
job of uh given what we've
 
04:04:31.269 --> 04:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
said including that last good
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion to um write up language of
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
what they think we kind of agreed to and
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
then we meet again you know and email it
 
04:04:42.750 --> 04:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
out to members subcommittee we meet
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
again we can discuss and see if you know
 
04:04:47.309 --> 04:04:47.319 align:start position:0%
if we're all okay with it and it
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
represents what we think we've been
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
discussing and then we can vote on that
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we're we're not
 
04:04:54.189 --> 04:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
have something clear enough to vote on
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
at this point so I'd be willing to take
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
a copy of your notes and with my notes
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
draft something distribute it get
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
feedback with other people's
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
notes and then have a right we need to
 
04:05:10.990 --> 04:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
be a little careful on the 911a of
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
having a meeting that's not in the
 
04:05:16.950 --> 04:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
public so I think it's fine if you come
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
up with a proposal and write it up and
 
04:05:21.389 --> 04:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
send it out to all of us but we do not
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
discuss it together until a meeting
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my understanding
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
one-on-one conversation to yeah and and
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
the other thing is there are uh
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
exceptions for caucus so you could I
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
think you could speak with represent M
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we could discuss it
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves as odd as that might seem I I
 
04:05:45.229 --> 04:05:45.239 align:start position:0%
did read over um we got extensive notes
 
04:05:47.630 --> 04:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
on this this morning that I read over
 
04:05:51.309 --> 04:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
and from Lucy Weber and I do believe
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
that just to uh straighten out the
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
language in a homework assignment that
 
04:05:59.469 --> 04:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
we then will discuss fully and openly
 
04:06:02.790 --> 04:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
public so if if any of us thinks if any
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
of us thinks that what you wrote up
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
differs from what they thought they
 
04:06:08.670 --> 04:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
heard here then that's a kind of a
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
technical thing they could reply to
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
everybody but not about if we decide
 
04:06:15.309 --> 04:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
from a policy standpoint we don't like
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
it correct okay I'm okay with that
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to be
 
04:06:24.229 --> 04:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
careful uh representative Brown sure um
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
that being a selectman and having this
 
04:06:31.269 --> 04:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.070 --> 04:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
that we're told reply all constitutes a
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
meeting I'm not sure if that's correct
 
04:06:39.550 --> 04:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of what I'm
 
04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
told and therefore would have to be
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
noticed and if you reply all then you're
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
actually having a meeting so we could
 
04:06:50.189 --> 04:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
reply if you if you think that there's a
 
04:06:52.990 --> 04:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
technical problem or that you think
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative g m misunder understood
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
things differently than you in a
 
04:07:00.950 --> 04:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
technical sense or whatever that's fine
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
um but yeah we can't be getting into
 
04:07:07.389 --> 04:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
policy discussions on email yeah so
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
exactly I would respond that reply don't
 
04:07:13.469 --> 04:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
use reply all is a really good cover
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
your butt technique to not get in
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
trouble but we can do it oneon-one and
 
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about did I miss a
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
notation of a change that someone else
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
heard yeah the email to everybody to try
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
and schedule a meeting I think is a
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
different story okay so there is a a
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
bunch more to this we're we're it goes
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
up to page 20 and we're on page 12 so
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
um do we want to you know and I guess
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
I'm I'll ask uh either director Courtney
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
or Mr AER house the is there anything
 
04:07:51.550 --> 04:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
beyond this point you know from uh uh
 
04:07:51.560 --> 04:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
beyond this point you know from uh uh
the

04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
membership Mr chair just to tell you my
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
brain is you need to go okay I can't
 
04:08:01.990 --> 04:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
doore then that's done um what what I
 
04:08:03.630 --> 04:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
would suggest if everybody's okay with
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
it we'll meet um morning before session
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's this Thursday
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
is that okay sure 15 yeah is 9:00 am
 
04:08:16.469 --> 04:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
okay to give us that way we'd have uh
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
we'd have three hours before we have to
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
break for lunch and then session does
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
anybody have a problem with that and if
 
04:08:26.630 --> 04:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
you do we can meet at 10 or not at
 
04:08:30.030 --> 04:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
all I will do my best to be there at 9:
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and certainly I can catch up
 
04:08:35.469 --> 04:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
if you start at 9: and I'm a few minutes
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
late I I'll do my best is 9
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
substantially better uh or well I I've
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
been 10 minutes late the last two times
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
so just go for it I'll get there as best
 
04:08:50.109 --> 04:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
I can because I think I mean for the
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
rest of this I think it's going to be
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
important to have you there all right
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
especially for the rest of this section
 
04:08:56.790 --> 04:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
okay giv your experience all right let
 
04:08:58.510 --> 04:08:58.520 align:start position:0%

there is you folks have
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
said which means we would need to break
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
by you know at least a quarter or
 
04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
12 um I'll be a big girl and get there
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%

04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
if he is he's watching you committing
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:40.510 --> 04:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
morning uh session starts at 1 pm on
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
Thursday which is the
 
04:09:45.870 --> 04:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
15th yeah and the first part of the I
 
04:09:48.510 --> 04:09:48.520 align:start position:0%
would I would I would never suggest
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
anyone miss any of the governor's speech
 
04:09:52.830 --> 04:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
course but officially we probably
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't run through into that although
 
04:09:59.309 --> 04:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
um but uh no disrespect to the governor
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's just I'm not big on
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
speeches um okay so that's what we'll do
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
we will we will meet at 9: we will break
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know uh 11:30ish I guess meeting
 
04:10:16.910 --> 04:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
here meeting here well I'm going to send
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
the request in to our assistant Carrie
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
Morris and she will email out the notice
 
04:10:25.109 --> 04:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
because it could be something else is
 
04:10:26.349 --> 04:10:26.359 align:start position:0%
scheduled we're going to beet somewhere
 
04:10:28.109 --> 04:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
probably in the lob but I can't
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee it's here I bring myop
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
12 putting in it is up to you I I I have

I think I may have a I may have a
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
personal preference to not have
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
individual bills that deal with so many
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
things even if they are related complely
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
