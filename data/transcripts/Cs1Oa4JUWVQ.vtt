00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
um noticed in in the explanation it
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
talked about that
 
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.269 align:start position:0%
talked about that
uh

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
that some money didn't you didn't get
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
some money that you thought you were
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
going to get us something and can you
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit about that in the
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
process on how we ended up where we are
 
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.190 align:start position:0%
process on how we ended up where we are
sure

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
so during during the senate phase of the
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
budget the department had requested to
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
remove 1.6 million dollars in federal
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
funds from each year at the time there
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
were a number of unknowns relative to
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
the federal funds we we didn't know
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
whether the federal dollars would be
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
going directly to some of the family
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
planning centers
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
director tilly can speak better to this
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
but at that point in time there are also
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
challenges relative to the title 10
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
rules um whereas many of the uh the
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
family planning
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
contractors uh they were not willing to
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
take those funds at that time i don't
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
know if you want to elaborate on that
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you very much for that so
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
again uh early in in that senate phase
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
there was some conversation about um
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
whether we were going to both be able to
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
expend those funds or if those funds
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
were going to go directly to the vendors
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
one of the miscommunications that
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
happened that time was around this
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
notion of funds going directly to from
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government directly to a
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
vendor that is the case for one agency
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
but the rest of the agencies that we
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
contract with get our funds uh the
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
department really put them out into
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
contracts so um we knew that when this
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
happened um that we would likely need to
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to come back to fiscal to remedy
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
this we knew we would also be getting a
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
new award
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
so that that's part of the the confusion
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
that happened back in the budgeting
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
process this this item here today simply
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
allows us to accept new funding that's
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
been made available to us so that we can
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
disperse it into the community
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay and this new funding is on top of
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
the funding that you had through the
 
00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
the funding that you had through the
budget

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
um i'll let you answer that part of that
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
yes we're asking to add add this federal
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
grant award to the budget again an error
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
was made during the the senate phase
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
where we requested that the 1.6 million
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
be taken out historically um those funds
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
have always been budgeted through the
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
budget process um in recent memory i i
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
can't recall or nor was i able to
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
identify any time at which those funds
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
had been taken out so this is really to
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
to add the the carryforward grant funds
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
allow us to spend those funds um and and
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
the new grant award uh in a normal year
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
this would have just been included in
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
hb1 and it already would have been
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
budgeted but again because an error was
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
made at that time during the senate
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
phase given the many unknowns uh we had
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
requests that it be taken out
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
and the only thing i'll add on that from
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
a programmatic side was
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
again we're in a new award period with
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
our federal funder so we had federal
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds in the beginning for state fiscal
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
year 22.
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
those funds have now all been either
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
expended or returned to the federal
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
government we have a new award that was
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
awarded to us in april
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
2022 and so that's what we're accepting
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
here is that new award that was awarded
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
to us for a new five-year cooperative
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
period okay so so how did we how did we
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
make it through
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
without these funds
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
in in the last round sure thank you so
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
part of the um
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
within our appropriation uh in the past
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year even early back in the
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year some of our agencies were
 
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.030 align:start position:0%
fiscal year some of our agencies were
not

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
expending or didn't want to accept
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
added some federal funds uh i believe in
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
december executive council so some of
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
those federal funds were put into
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
contract we knew that we would need to
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
amend those contracts this spring when
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
we got a new award so we just simply
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
didn't spend down all of those federal
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
dollars we anticipate spending down this
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
and with uh
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
with title 10 did the change of the
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
administration and washington did that
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
in effect anyway new hampshire's
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'll answer that this way so yes there
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
was a change in the federal
 
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
was a change in the federal
administration

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
under the previous administration there
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
were some rules attached to the title 10
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
funds that made some of our
 
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.030 align:start position:0%
funds that made some of our
historical

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
partners in the community either
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
ineligible and then other entities did
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
not choose to participate in title 10
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
because of some of the rules that were a
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
part of the title 10 program back under
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
the previous administration
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
um in the fall of last year november
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
some those rules changed and our
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
partners in the community are
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
willing to participate in the title 10
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
program now
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay i uh how many how many agencies
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
or organizations would be getting this
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
money that's a great question
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that we currently have
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
four community health centers so places
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
like amiskegh health in manchester coast
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
family health up in berlin um the
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
belmont merrimack cap in the laconia
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
area and lamprey i believe yep lamprey
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
down in the nashua area those are our
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
current grantees going to governor and
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
council to add additional funds um to uh
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
because that's in procurement i can't
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
tell you who's in that bucket um so when
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
those go to executive council we will be
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
adding funds to agencies that have
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
responded to an rfp that was back in the
 
00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
responded to an rfp that was back in the
fall

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay and one final question
 
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.070 align:start position:0%
okay and one final question
uh

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
under class 102 it indicates that the
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
funds will be used to contract with
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
vendors to provide services required by
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
title 10 program
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any kind of a list as
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
to what those
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
things are other than some ambiguous
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
terms that
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
could pick up many different things
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
sure i i can tell you um what isn't
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
funded and then i can tell you what is
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
funded so abortion services are not
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
funded through title 10 services no
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
state nor general funds are allowed to
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
be used for abortion related services so
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
i'll put that over to the side what is
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
funded is access to comprehensive
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%

rich albertman the director of our
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
yeah whatever it is
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah those those came out after uh i
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
left the service so
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have a pair of those in my
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
closet but
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
well welcome and uh
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
senator daniels did you have a question
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
the the explanation on this seems like
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
it should be something that fits more in
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
the department of education than when
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
veterans affairs you know when we're
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
talking about uh increasing the
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the skills of stem
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
so i was wondering if you could just
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
help me make that connection
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
with the military
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir so uh you're referring to on
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
what's called star base
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's a department of defense funded
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
program for youth-based initiatives
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so the funding comes through dod
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
department of defense
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
we were the ones who took the initiative
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
to apply for the application and to
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
compete nationally for this program that
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
increases based training for fifth grade
 
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.909 align:start position:0%
increases based training for fifth grade
students

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
in local schools
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
so once it's established we'll
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
collaborate with department of education
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure whether the curriculum
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
is learned everywhere or part of the
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
education-based system that gets credit
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
for in the school system but because
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay and i i think i kind of understand
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
all that i just i don't see the
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
connection i mean you you're helping out
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
a fifth grader but you know if you were
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
saying this is going to help us
 
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.149 align:start position:0%
saying this is going to help us
recruit

00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
recruit
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
something later i i just i i can't find
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
that connection
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
there are certain youth-based programs
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
that the department of defense funds for
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
example there's something called youth
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
challenge so for underprivileged kids
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
who are who are struggling to get
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
through a high school degree certain
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
states run what's called the youth uh
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
youth challenge program where sort of
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
like a one-year military type boot camp
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
where the disadvantaged kids who might
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
not get a high school degree come and
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
just run like a one year boot camp to
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
get these kids to get a ged
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
this is a sim this is a separate but
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
program uh
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
developed for a youth so
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of our technology in the air force
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
the air national guard at pease and some
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
of our high-tech stuff in the army guard
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
here our highmars rocket systems require
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
like a technical base competency of
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
which today's youth doesn't have
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
so they do their asvab test to try to
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
take that
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
initial enlistment um
 
00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.230 align:start position:0%
initial enlistment um
test

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
um the scores aren't there
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
so this is just an initiative to try to
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
promote stem based topics in schools
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
they won't say but indirectly it exposes
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
the youth to the military so by us
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
hosting it in pembroke
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
um it'll allow kids to come and see
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
military personnel
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
might put the connection you know if we
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
have a helicopter there or something
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
like that where they see this sort of um
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
correlation between getting a stem type
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
education and how it correlates to a
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
sort of military profession
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative petrie uh thank you madam
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh i'm surprised that you haven't you
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
don't work more with the civil air
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
patrol because they do a lot of this uh
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
training you know uh through through
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
their program
 
00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:50.710 align:start position:0%
their program
and

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the civil air patrol auxiliary
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
air force so
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
if you would
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh sir we do so we sort of partnered
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
with civil air patrol on abc cadets and
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's boyce call scouts bsa
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
to support them so for example civilian
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
patrol and sea cadets use our concrete
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
armory to host their monthly meetings
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
and so we typically open up our armories
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
for no cost to any youth-based program
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
if they need facilities to be used
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
right you know is there more
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
coordination with what they do you know
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
as far as the programs
 
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
as far as the programs
uh

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
yes to the extent that we will typically
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
meet with their leadership on an annual
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
basis to see what synergy can be
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
provided so they will use our facilities
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
for their like lack of a better term
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
summer camp so they will go up to
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
stratford new hampshire where our
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
training facility is and stay overnight
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
or for the weekend and use some of our
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
our training facilities there very good
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
are there any uh
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro oh thank you madam
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair general great to see you uh thanks
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
for coming
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know how you identify
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
students that are at that are at risk
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
what what's
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
who do you how do you correlate this
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
with the education department because
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
some of these kids may fall into the
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
category that needs special education
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature but if you're
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to approve skills for students at
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
risk in the fifth grade
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a fairly uh significant
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
task and this isn't this isn't enough
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
money in my opinion to do that
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
so how is it done
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
so sir
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
what we did was we reached out to
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
department of education and after that
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
we went to the manchester and
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
londonderry school districts and talked
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
to their superintendents and we just and
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
we described the program to them they
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
were all in unfortunately both districts
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
their superintendents have moved on so
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
we got to start a new from those two
 
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
we got to start a new from those two
schools

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.230 align:start position:0%
schools
but

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
but they identified the lack of that
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
stem based and what typically happens
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
and it varies slightly from state to
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
state is
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
for example a fifth grade student would
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
get on his school bus come to pembroke
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
and for one day for five days for five
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
weeks so one day a week for five weeks
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
show up
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
to sort of a
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
stem computer digital classroom
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
that this will fund both the classroom
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
material and the teachers
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
to then just teach these kids almost
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
sort of like an extracurricular activity
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
to try to enlighten them and say hey
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
look this is what you can do
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
um in that type of environment
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
one further question so you have to
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to the school district
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
you you create some kind of a
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
rapprochement with the school district
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
the school district identifies students
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
places them
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh in this program
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
who does the follow-up
 
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.390 align:start position:0%
who does the follow-up
um

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
it will be the
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
the contracted educators through this
 
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
the contracted educators through this
initiative

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
that will then have to measure the
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
metrics to prove that like it's it's
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
improving their scores
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you general nice to see you again
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
so i would like this program in uh
 
00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.269 align:start position:0%
so i would like this program in uh
conway

00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
conway
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
i i think it's it's it sounds like a
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
great program
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
but i think that the focus
 
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.990 align:start position:0%
but i think that the focus
on

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
getting to a school district and doing
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
some kind of an arrangement with them
 
00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:21.029 align:start position:0%
some kind of an arrangement with them
and

00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
that's going to be interesting how that
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
happens right
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
i would move the item thank you very
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
much do i have a second
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%

representative rosenwald thank you thank
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um i have two questions
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
actually but i don't know if the
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
department might not be better able to
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
assist in the answers
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
the health and human services yeah if
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
they maybe could
 
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.750 align:start position:0%
they maybe could
join

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
join
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
good morning lori shibanet commissioner
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
um

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
i noticed in the narrative that
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're not specific performance
 
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.190 align:start position:0%
they're not specific performance
measures

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.070 align:start position:0%
measures
for

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of this proposed
 
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:21.669 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness of this proposed
program

00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:23.269 align:start position:0%
program
but

00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interest in the
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
legislature in
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
in making sure that our substance use
 
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.669 align:start position:0%
in making sure that our substance use
disorder

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
prevention and treatment programs have
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
have quantitative measurable
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
outcomes and we have another item later
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
from the department of safety about the
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
no safe experiences
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
they have two really
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
i think spot on
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
performance measures one is the
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
reduction in the number of drug overdose
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
deaths in young people and the second
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
one is the reduction in percentage of
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
youth use of non-prescribed drugs
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
and so my question is
 
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
and so my question is
what

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
kind of performance measures
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
is this program going to have the
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
narrative points towards it may reduce
 
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.230 align:start position:0%
narrative points towards it may reduce
stressors

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
stressors
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
which might reduce binge drinking so we
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
we're not going to just look at stress
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
reduction are we we're going to actually
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
did the gym memberships and the fitness
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
equipment lead to a reduction
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
in substance use
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
and can you get that in a year
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
so ma'am i'm going to try first i'm
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
going to pass it on to colonel olbermann
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
our wellness director so i'll give you
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
context uh first of all so i said on the
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
the joint military task force one of a
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
task force for the governing commission
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
and alcohol and other drugs and we
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for service members families in
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
the veteran community typically a
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
majority our advocacy is for veterans
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
because of the size of the population
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
however national guard bureau did a
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
study of the health of the force for the
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
army national guard for the 54 states
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
and territory
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
in 2019 we ranked 45th in a bad way for
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
the health of our fours
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
and the biggest
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
discrepancy was uh
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
alcohol misuse that apparently affects
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
7.9 percent of our force
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
and then so what we did was this
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
initiative will hopefully get after that
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i think big broad speaking the annual
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
performance metric would hopefully be
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
the decline of substance misuse amongst
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
our fours
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's the broad and then
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
to thank you sir
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
so that's one part of it the other thing
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
which is also difficult is
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
this money is not just for the new
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire national guard i have to be
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
very clear about that this money is from
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire for all
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
service men and women serving in the
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire because of that i
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't have access to their metrics
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
so that's where we're consulting to do
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
questionnaire support
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
from a professional
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
statistician to go ahead and write the
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
proper questions to get after what
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
you're asking for is how are we
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
measuring the decline of substance use
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so that will be contracted out to
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
that specialist build that and as part
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the reimbursement process they will
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
have to answer these questions so we can
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
collect the data from all service
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
members and have that piece of it
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
internally what the adjunct general just
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
stated we have unit risk inventories
 
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we get an annual basis that we can
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
show for the new hampshire army national
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
guard at least whether this has caused a
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
decrease in their use and that will be
 
00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
also reported but because it's for all
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
service members i don't have a tool that
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
i could
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
get after what you're looking for
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
without doing that question there but i
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
think you did answer
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
that you're going to look at the
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
end result not just
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
did it reduce the stressors oh
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely and i think
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's good my second question has to do
 
00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.230 align:start position:0%
that's good my second question has to do
with

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
the funding more
 
00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
the funding more
um

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
as as you prob i hope know the
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
governor's commission funding
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
is currently entirely directed towards
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
the medicaid program
 
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.110 align:start position:0%
the medicaid program
not

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
other contracts those contracts have
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
been backfilled by a five-year agreement
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
that runs out i think in another year
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
the plan for future funding
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and maybe commissioner shippenhead
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
wants to take this is this a one-time
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
expectation or do you think we're going
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
ongoing funding
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
after that agreement with the hospitals
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
runs out i think that you know i'll
 
00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
speak directly to the hospital's
 
00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.389 align:start position:0%
speak directly to the hospital's
contribution

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the for the governor's commission i
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
do expect
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
that we will enter into negotiations to
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
continue that contribution moving
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
forward as for this specific agreement
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to let the the general
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
speak to that because i wasn't part of
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
those conversations thank you
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
so ma'am i believe it's a three-year
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
so what we plan on doing is look after
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
the doubt after three years and seeing
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
did it work
 
00:34:37.359 --> 00:34:38.149 align:start position:0%
did it work
um

00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
from that point forward then decide if
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
is that the sort of number one priority
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
for our service members you know for
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
example another um another issue we have
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
is child care
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
so it's another priority for us but
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
we're trying
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get the department of
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
defense fund a pilot program for that so
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's almost uh three years from now
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
we'll sort of review this data say is it
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
our number one issue for service members
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
to try to reduce substance misuse and
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
retain them in our force
 
00:35:05.839 --> 00:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
retain them in our force
um

00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:08.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
final question then if i could so if
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
you're planning a three-year program but
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have maybe
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
one or maybe two years
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
of hospital backfill funding
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
would you fund the third year or maybe
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
the second and third year from within
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
your department's current budget or
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
would you end this program
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
so if i understand it correctly ma'am
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
we will
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
utilize this pilot program up to this
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
dollar amount of uh 500 000
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
so in the event it's under utilized we
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
would probably come to you and ask for
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
an extension
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
to just use the funds that have been
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
allocated right now for the length of
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
time of which the use is needed
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes represent or senator daniels thank
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
you uh it's been stated that this is the
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
lower substance misuse
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have numerous programs out there
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
through hhs now
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
that that deal with that um
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge they haven't been overly
 
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.069 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge they haven't been overly
successful

00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
because we continue to pull more and
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
why aren't we just using those
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
programs i mean why why why it seems
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
like we're getting the military which
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
more more the defense of the state of
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the country uh involved in the these
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh so sir i think an ancillary benefit
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
to this program is the fact that we it
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
will also work as a retention tool
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i i tell people all the time there's
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
no line at our door right this is the
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
worst recruiting year since the end of
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
the volunteer draft in 1973. and so the
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
problem is no one's joining so how do we
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
retain our soldiers what they have a
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
substance misuse issue
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a physical fitness issue
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
the army just rolled out a new fitness
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
test called the army combat fitness test
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
um it's the crossfit games right there's
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
six events and when 75 percent of your
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
force is part time and you only see them
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
two days a month how do you keep them in
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
shape so they can pass that test and
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
retain them in your force
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i mean it's primarily to get after
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
the health of the force but that
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
ancillary benefit is the fact that if
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're in our force we have to figure
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
out how to retain them
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
and it and then we only have two
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
facilities that have 24 7 gym access
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's concord nsrp national guard bays so
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
if i'm a part-time soldier in keene
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
where does he work out or train or
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
exercise other than those two days a
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
month where he doesn't have in this
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
facility so we replicated this state uh
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
help the state employee sort of uh
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
anthem blue cross blue shield sort of uh
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
concept of trying to get reduced gym
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
membership and sort of buying physical
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
fitness equipment for their home
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
in order to hopefully drive
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
substance misuse down
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
fitness up and retain a quality force
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we can help the our state in our
 
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.069 align:start position:0%
that we can help the our state in our
nation

00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
so a few years ago i was in the national
 
00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:14.950 align:start position:0%
so a few years ago i was in the national
guard

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
guard
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't have any kind of this program
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
how how did we ever make it through
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
i i think i heard you say that we were
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
in uh like 45th in health now yes have
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
you got any kind of historical thing to
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
show where we were in the last 10 years
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
they published an annual annual report
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
so we have the la we have 2019 and 2020
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
with us i can look back
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
so in 2019 we're 45th
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
in a bad way and in 2020 we're 37th
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay i just just just curious because
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
historically we we didn't have to have
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
this five hundred thousand dollar
 
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
this five hundred thousand dollar
program

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
to stay to stay in shape but then
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
what what what has changed i mean
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
today's youth has difficulty handling
 
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.349 align:start position:0%
today's youth has difficulty handling
stress

00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
so whether it's substance misuse
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
suicides or any other stressor to the
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
today's youth
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
we have significantly more uh
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
psychological health directors and staff
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure the the health of our force
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
the fitness test has changed it used to
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
be push-up sit-ups two-mile run
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
now it's a deadlift it's a shuttle run
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's a throwing a ball and it's like
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
everything is more complex or more
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
everything is more complex or more
demanding

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
demanding
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that our deployment
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
cycle has increased
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
so we just got off uh two years of
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
covered response we've had over 800
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
soldiers and airmen activated um we are
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the process of deploying another 450
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
soldiers out the door in the next 12
 
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
soldiers out the door in the next 12
months

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
the pace of our our our op temple
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
operational temple of what we're doing
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
has not like subsided and i think when
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
you look at the
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
the lack of uh
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
the ability of our youth to handle
 
00:40:05.599 --> 00:40:07.510 align:start position:0%
the ability of our youth to handle
stress

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
stress
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
the smaller size of our force and the
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
operational demands of which we're
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
placing upon them is creating this
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
perfect storm
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay one final question this may be more
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner if this if this
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
program is successful
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
where others in hhs may not be as
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
successful can we expect that there will
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
be programs that will be dropped within
 
00:40:29.839 --> 00:40:31.270 align:start position:0%
be programs that will be dropped within
dhhs

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
anytime we have duplicate programs that
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
target the same demographic or the same
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
audience if we find one of those
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
programs is more successful than the
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
other then obviously we would shift
 
00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
funding towards the program that has
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
shown to be more successful that is why
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
we measure our success in all of our
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
programs thank you
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion please
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%

your mic is on so you must have a
 
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.430 align:start position:0%
your mic is on so you must have a
question

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
i have a few madam chair though okay
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
just continue with your questions uh
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
thanks mark for appearing today
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
you responded to a couple of questions
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
we had prior to the meeting and mr shea
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to get them to us your
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
answers and
 
00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
one of the documents you suggested that
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
we look at was the state of new
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire capital projects fund program
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
plan for broadband contracts
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
so reading quickly through the document
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
i see there's a requirement for mapping
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
i think about eight hundred thousand
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in the request that you have
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
before us today
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
has any of that mapping been done to
 
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.630 align:start position:0%
has any of that mapping been done to
identify

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
those areas of the state that are really
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
suffering i think it said thirty
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
thousand homes or households don't have
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
access to broadband that's exactly what
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing i think when we started this
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
it was clear there was no real mechanism
 
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
to determine what the unserved and
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
underserved are particularly with the
 
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.829 align:start position:0%
underserved are particularly with the
new

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:37.839 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
speed i know that in question three um
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
the federal gov federal government is
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
going to be requiring um either 100 100
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
speeds which is upload and download
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
speeds or 100 upload 20
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
100 download 20 upload with scalability
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
to those speeds there's no mapping out
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
there at the federal or state level that
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
show that so when we were working on
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
this we thought it was important to
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
develop mapping and to put use some of
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
our administrative funds that we have
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
with that purpose we thought that was
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to be a benefit for this program
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
and moving forward
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
another question if i could have i'm
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
now it says here that there's going to
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
be like one contractor selected to
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
service the whole state am i reading
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
that correctly i'm just curious for this
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
part of the entire contract yes um as
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is there's a this is 40 of the
 
00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
money that we've received from the fed
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
what we're going to receive from the
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
federal government we were approved for
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
122 million
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
the other approximately 65 to 70 million
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
dollars is going to be in the broadband
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
matching grant initiative that was
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
improved by the legislature last year in
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
sb 85 and we had to
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
get it amended this year in senate bill
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
445 so the majority of the funds that
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
come from this grant will be through
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
that broadband matching grant which is
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
going to be a municipality based program
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
so isps and towns will work together to
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
address those and that will be open to
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
all providers we wanted to move forward
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
with this other portion of it because as
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
we were starting to go through this
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
process we were seeing things like
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
inflation go up gas prices supply chain
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
and we felt that
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
as fast as we could move forward as
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
compared to other states we felt like it
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
would give us a better opportunity to
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
get those supplies and get
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
the broadband built on happening before
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
we had all the states working at the
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
same time because remember there's also
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure bill that's going to
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
have at least 100 million dollars and
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
for other states much much more
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
so they're all going to be working at
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
the same time to be doing build out so
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
we felt it was important to try to get a
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
jump on that and we felt that was the
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
best mechanism to do that so forty
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
percent of those funds will be through
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
the rfp processes which is currently
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
out there now with a remaining majority
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
of the funds in a very targeted
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
one-on-one community one isp or
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
however we however that works so that's
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
how we're going to move forward with
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
that and just one further if i could
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
have been i'm sure thanks
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
so now
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
what guarantees are you going to have
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
that these rates now you got a private
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
company using public funds to develop
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
better infrastructure for broadband
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
i see there was like a 30 credit per
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
month that would be given out
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
which doesn't seem significant when most
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
bills are far higher than that those
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
that can't afford broadband period so
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
what guarantees is the state going to do
 
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure the prices are reasonable
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
and i know that thirty dollars is
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
federally set i understand yep that's
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
the federal program used to be 50 and
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
then in the revised arpa bill they
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
changed it to change the program made it
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
to 30.
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
however i they also are going to have
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
some providers are also going to offer
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
lower tiers low-cost tiers that will
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
some of them will start as low as 30 so
 
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.990 align:start position:0%
some of them will start as low as 30 so
theoretically

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
if you meet certain qualifications you
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay anything but that's a
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
those are questions that we're going to
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
be asking to not only to the provider
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
who would get the uh who would be the
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
applicant for this rp
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
also for bmgis and we're going to ask
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
those questions are you participating in
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
this program are you going to be
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
participating in the low-cost tier
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
program we are going to be asking a lot
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
of questions on that
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
at least in bmgi and not in this program
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
per se
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
we can't mandate certain prices that's
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
in the state law so we can't say you can
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
do a price here but at this community
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
you have to have a different price we
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
can't mandate that but we can have a
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
conversation what are your pricing
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
what's your plan and we can
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that and then later on in
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure there's going to be
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for areas that are considered
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
high costs and we're still trying to
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
work through that that's down the line
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
in probably 2023 and there may be some
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
mechanisms there to address more of the
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
of the affordability issues there as
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
well so there are a lot of areas that
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking into to make
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
sure that those that that there's
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
affordability built into all of this
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks madam chair
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
i i do have one
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
there were broadband studies in the
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
north country in particular
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
and the major problem up there was
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
called the last mile
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
are we is this broadband
 
00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:23.109 align:start position:0%
are we is this broadband
thing

00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
going to go the last mile
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes and that's the preference of
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
the programs we're working with so every
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
dollar that we're doing all all 122
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
minus the administrative costs will go
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
towards last mile build out correct okay
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
because that's that's the real problem
 
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:40.710 align:start position:0%
because that's that's the real problem
not

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
not um
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
this is just in the main water system
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
or is it the connection between
 
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.430 align:start position:0%
or is it the connection between
the

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
public water or the main water system in
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
so i'll defer to
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh brandon here but uh it does the the
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
federal requirements and therefore what
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help the the systems
 
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:27.990 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help the the systems
with

00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
are including not only the water main
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
but the the connections that
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
go to the house okay so is that okay
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
all right that's that's a good thing
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and uh we're we're
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
not doing very well on this one not
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
representing hamrick well my question is
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
a little bit just
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
kind of on this topic but in general uh
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm the chairman of the planning board
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
in our town and we're confronting right
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
now the groundwater remapping of the
 
00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:56.069 align:start position:0%
now the groundwater remapping of the
town

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh and the aquifer protection zone
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
come to find out the new federal
 
00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.870 align:start position:0%
come to find out the new federal
mapping

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
mapping
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have a closed dump
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
that we capped about 10 years ago
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
it sits right in our aquifer protection
 
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.630 align:start position:0%
it sits right in our aquifer protection
zone

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
zone
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
as newly defined
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh should
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
should there be or is there a program to
 
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:18.710 align:start position:0%
should there be or is there a program to
do

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
a pfest testing
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
for these capped
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh dumps uh representative emrick i have
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it got to
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott or not but i have
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
asked at our september meeting
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
that he come prepared to talk to us
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
about the pfas problems in local
 
00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:40.470 align:start position:0%
about the pfas problems in local
landfills

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'll look forward to the answer and um
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
so that because
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
when i read through
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
the information that was in here
 
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:50.950 align:start position:0%
the information that was in here
uh

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.069 align:start position:0%
uh
wells

00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
wells
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
looked to be in great shape as opposed
 
00:53:54.079 --> 00:53:55.349 align:start position:0%
looked to be in great shape as opposed
to

00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
where we stand on uh on landfills so
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
we'll be we'll be having that
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
discussion in um
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%

all know that uh
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
the pfas business is uh
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
unending and we need to try to get a
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%

okay

00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
we now turn to fis
 
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.589 align:start position:0%
we now turn to fis
22

00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%

263

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
263
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
and we are going to kind of do these in
 
00:54:44.559 --> 00:54:46.390 align:start position:0%
and we are going to kind of do these in
conjunction

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
conjunction
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
good morning chase hageman deputy
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
director at the governor's office for
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
so commissioner caswell sent you here by
 
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
yourself today huh i'm on my own you're
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:17.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
where am i
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay ah
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on um
 
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.430 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on um
263

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh mike i did have a i did have a
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
question and uh although you sent an
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
answer i think it's important that we
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
all understand this
 
00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:42.710 align:start position:0%
all understand this
um

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
it says in there that uh utility
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
or that rental assistance
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
also receives funding for
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
electricity and
 
00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.750 align:start position:0%
electricity and
heating

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
heating
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
whatever it is correct
 
00:55:58.319 --> 00:55:59.270 align:start position:0%
whatever it is correct
and

00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
speculating that
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
most of the people that would be
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
applying for rental assistance
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
are in the category of
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
being able to apply for light
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
and so my my question is
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
are we messing with the light program
 
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.750 align:start position:0%
are we messing with the light program
or

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
do they get both
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
or what kind of guidance has gone out on
 
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
or what kind of guidance has gone out on
that

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's a great question and as you
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned madam chair we did provide a
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
response but for the record um
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
as we understand it has been described
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
to us by the department of energy there
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
is no negative impact on the light
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
program by the rental assistance program
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
as in in terms of the reimbursement of
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
utility costs getting emergency rental
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
assistance for utilities doesn't pull
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
someone out of the light program or the
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance program and there's no
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
double dipping there's just there are
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
systems in place that help track who is
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
getting what so that when one assistance
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
is provided for a utility the other is
 
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.829 align:start position:0%
is provided for a utility the other is
not

00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
are we still in the phase where
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
the renter has to apply
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes so as a basis of the program the
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
renter applies uh that's that's always
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
been the case okay and so as i looked at
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
the figures it doesn't appear to me
 
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.349 align:start position:0%
the figures it doesn't appear to me
that

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
the renters are applying
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
okay and i don't know whether
 
00:57:38.559 --> 00:57:40.789 align:start position:0%
okay and i don't know whether
the

00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
landlords are just being kind and not
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
kicking them out
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
or if
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know exactly where that is
 
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.750 align:start position:0%
you know exactly where that is
so

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
in general the the demand for the
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
program has sustained if not grown over
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
the last year or so so i'm not i'm not
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
sure which numbers you're referring to
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
where it appears that there is a
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
reduction applications it actually has
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
sustained if not risen a little bit over
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
time oh okay okay and is that run
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
through cap
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes so um gopher uh basically
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
sends money to new hampshire housing
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
finance authority who works with the
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
caps to facilitate the program both
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
rental assistance and utility assistance
 
00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:21.430 align:start position:0%
rental assistance and utility assistance
okay

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.710 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you my
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it's the the
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
renter that applies
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
for it and that uh any
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
assistance is is sent to the renter
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
that's incorrect though the assistance
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
goes directly to the landlord and the
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
utility company to to pay the rent or
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
the utility bill um in limited
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances the renter would
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
potentially receive the money if the
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
landlord is not particularly
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
agreeable in terms of interacting with
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
are there are there any programs
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
possibly under cap or whatever that
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
the money is sent to
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
the renter because i'm i'm dealing with
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
a constituent who
 
00:59:07.599 --> 00:59:09.109 align:start position:0%
a constituent who
uh

00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
has somebody that had been renting but
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
now they're not paying their rent
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
but they can't kick them out
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
and that they had they had applied for
 
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.549 align:start position:0%
and that they had they had applied for
money

00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
but the landlord's not seeing any of it
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis i'm hap we're
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
happy to help work with a landlord or a
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
tenant to resolve any particular issues
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
and we often do that so cases will come
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
into us with a particular issue or
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
challenge to address and we work with
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing finance to see if
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
there's a remedy so i'd be a little
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
resident to
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
reticent to speak to a specific
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
situation without getting more detail on
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
the applicant in the landlord situation
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
just to answer your question sorry um
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
i i would have to get additional
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
information from the caps on any
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
programs they have where money is sent
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
directly to the tenant
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that is the case
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
by and large in era i would imagine
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
you'll have a call from senator daniels
 
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
i imagine i will
 
01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:04.710 align:start position:0%
i imagine i will
[Laughter]

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.510 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
uh

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
so i think it was after the fact but
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
the lba did provide us with a copy of
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
the governor's office of emergency
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
relief and recovery
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
contribution i guess if you will to help
 
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
with rental assistance for utilities and
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
internet and so forth of ninety three
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars is that per year or for
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
six months or it would be over the la
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me over the life of the program
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh based on households that are
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
receiving the benefits then that spans
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
all the types of services including
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
rental assistance under era under the
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
rental assistance program um households
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
are able to receive funding
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
at this point under the era 2 program
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to in the next item
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
as as far out or as
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
in total 18 months they can only ask for
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
three prospective months at a time
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
however but over the life of the program
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
they could receive as much as 18 months
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
in support
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay and just one further question
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
certainly i could madam chair thanks
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
so at our pre-fiscal meeting uh i have
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
to give credit where i guess it's due
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative edwards raised an
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
interesting point i thought that by
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
providing rental assistance we're
 
01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually creating a problem by forcing
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
rents up perhaps
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
when if you didn't provide that
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
assistance it would keep rents lower is
 
01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.829 align:start position:0%
assistance it would keep rents lower is
there

01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
is that a supported theory or is makes i
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
i haven't specifically explored that in
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
terms of data that might
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
answer that particular question there
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
are limitations on what level of income
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
a household can have to even get into
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
the program so
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of the level of rents being
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
driven up uh
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
i i would be hesitant to speculate but
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's data out there that can
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
be analyzed over time to see if that is
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
the case okay thanks and thanks madam
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
chair are there any further questions
 
01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.589 align:start position:0%
chair are there any further questions
okay

01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh are there any questions on
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
22-264 separately
 
01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:17.270 align:start position:0%
22-264 separately
i

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
obviously this is just an extension of
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%

seven plus million

for uh sud related programming services
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
and project investments
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on this
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh rep senator
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you
 
01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:50.150 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you
um

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
two parts of it that equals about 12
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars for
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
additional beds
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
um what are you talking about thank you
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
for the question sandra and just and
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
chase hageman deputy director at gopher
 
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.549 align:start position:0%
chase hageman deputy director at gopher
again

01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify senator the the two
 
01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
parts that refer to um increasing bed
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
capacity i think only total seven
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
million um the proposed budgets for
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
those are sorry yeah so you just wanted
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
to be clear there um
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
the the short answer is it depends
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
because we're still working with dhhs
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
and the governor's council on
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
alcohol and other drugs to finalize the
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
program itself which will become
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
publicly known posted on gopher's
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
webpage excuse me with all the
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines necessary for that
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the detox bed program
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
however is to expand uh bed capacity at
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
various tiers of
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
detox needs and there are i think four
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
tiers if i remember correctly this
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
program would focus on the top tier and
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
there are a little over 60 beds in the
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
state right now
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
and the idea obviously would be to
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
increase those number of beds and
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have some insight that there are
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
projects being explored that could
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
increase that significantly but i don't
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
know the exact number off the top of my
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
head it would in part depend on the
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
construct of the program
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you well how did you arrive at the
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars then
 
01:06:20.319 --> 01:06:21.589 align:start position:0%
seven million dollars then
if

01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not by the number of beds we
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
wanted so the the number is based off of
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
what would be the purpose of the program
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
which is capital improvements and
 
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.589 align:start position:0%
which is capital improvements and
investments

01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
investments
 
01:06:31.599 --> 01:06:32.390 align:start position:0%
investments
again

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard from
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
other facilities and potential
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
facilities coming online that
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
could have
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
capital needs costs that you know range
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
from a couple hundred thousand to a
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
couple million
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to leave room
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
in the program
 
01:06:47.839 --> 01:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
in the program
to

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient awards based on what
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
becomes the eligibility and requirements
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
if you notice in the item itself
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
we did request a little bit of
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility on what ultimately becomes
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
the final funding amount for some of
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
these programs because as we go on to
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
finalize what we anticipate being the
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
need the number may need to change but
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
it certainly wouldn't go beyond the
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
authorized amount
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
requested overall in the item
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
one final thank you and will these both
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
of these parts
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
um be available to the medicaid program
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
yes the purpose um especially on the
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
detox side is to make sure that these
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
are beds that are available for medicaid
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
users thank you
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
i do have a question yes i i'm not
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to the program but uh
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
where are we going to get the people
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
work in these facilities since we are
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
right now we are
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
we have nursing homes and hospitals that
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
can't go to their full bed capacity
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the um
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
staff to take care of it it's always a
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
great question madam chair and it's
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
usually always the same answer it
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
depends on the you know the entity
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
coming forward and applying and them
 
01:08:07.829 --> 01:08:07.839 align:start position:0%
having sufficient staff to run the
 
01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
program they're proposing
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
as with all arpa dollars if for some
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
reason this this um program is
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
underutilized those funds would come
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
back for reallocation for other purposes
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
so the money would not go unused it
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
would eventually be used for something
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
but uh the whole state is is
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing staffing issues including
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
the state itself so it's a tough it's
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
always the question it's always a tough
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
one to answer okay
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
i don't have any problem with the
 
01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
program i just i don't want to have this
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
great program out there and
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
the beds go empty so we need to make
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
sure that when you're asking them that
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
they uh tell you how they're going to
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
man it
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
and if if i may a woman whatever i just
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out um the late items
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
that came through uh for for vote today
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
are all interconnected relative to sud
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
um initiatives and programs so i just
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
didn't want to leave any of the other
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
agencies that are coming to the table
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
late out to dry
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
um they're all connected okay
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh could i have a motion please on fis

documentation on the success
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
we have had i mean we continue to to
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
provide funds for naloxone but
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
we don't never seem to see any reports
 
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.070 align:start position:0%
we don't never seem to see any reports
on

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know whether the numbers are going
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
down whether they're going up how the
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
money's being spent where it's being
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
spent or anything like that i mean maybe
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
you could shed some light on that
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you and um in one of the pre uh
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal questions this question did come
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
up and we cited the research um we do
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
have uh dr ballard here who
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
has looked extensively into the
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
the different strategies for addressing
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
most importantly the opioid
 
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.590 align:start position:0%
most importantly the opioid
epidemic

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
epidemic
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
so he's available here to perhaps answer
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
your questions and we can also provide
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
the research that we cited in that
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
response okay why don't you ask them to
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record my name is
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
jonathan ballard to work as the chief
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
medical officer for department of health
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's been extensive research on the
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
approach to solving improving upon the
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose problem
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder in general
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
as you're aware new hampshire is good
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
could you move your mic a little closer
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had a significant
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
significant escalation of opioid
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths really starting in about
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
2014 and we hit our high in 2017
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
that led forth you know a very large
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged effort to combat substance
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
use disorder
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
and reduce opioid overdose deaths
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
naloxone being one potential or once
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
part of that overall package
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
since 2017 opioid overdose deaths in new
 
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire have declined year over year
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
and we're the only state in the country
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
to has had year-over-year declines of
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose deaths in fact during
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
when all others most all other states
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
all the except for states
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
had opioid overdose deaths significantly
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
increase including our neighbors in
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
vermont had very high year-over-year
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
increases new hampshire did not
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
so there's been studies researchers who
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
have looked at this
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
in the medical journal called public
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
health reports it's the surgeon
 
01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:17.110 align:start position:0%
health reports it's the surgeon
general's

01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
medical journal
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
an article came out last year that
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
looked at why did new hampshire and the
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
three other states have a different
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
outcome compared to the rest of the
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
country when really this is a worldwide
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
problem of substance use disorder and
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose deaths
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
in that report it said specifically that
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and these other states had
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
very common
 
01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
very common
approaches

01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
approaches
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
of why they were so successful it said
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
that you have to have
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
broad state policies you have to improve
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
treatment opportunities you have to
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
educate prescribers you have to
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
and they lay out particularly you have
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
to have broad-based naloxone
 
01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.510 align:start position:0%
to have broad-based naloxone
distribution

01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire did differently prior
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the opioid the pandemic
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
was we made a shift in how we got
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
naloxone out to the public
 
01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.910 align:start position:0%
naloxone out to the public
previously

01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's a standing order that i write
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
that anybody can pick up naloxone the
 
01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.189 align:start position:0%
that anybody can pick up naloxone the
legislature

01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
allowed us to make that standing order
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
people can go to a pharmacy to pick it
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
up but that's not been successful in new
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire nor other states across the
 
01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.229 align:start position:0%
hampshire nor other states across the
country

01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
it has to be directly distributed put
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
into the hands of bystanders loved ones
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
to allow for that opioid reversal agent
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
to be available and work
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
so that's so when the we created the
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
doorways program we shifted distribution
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
of naloxone being from a centralized
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
state program
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
out through our partners more local to
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
the communities where individuals
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
where the doorways know their local
 
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
non-profit agencies the non-profit
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
agencies and other partners are the ones
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
now who are giving out naloxone directly
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the potential bystanders for an
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose death
 
01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:04.149 align:start position:0%
opioid overdose death
and

01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
we know naloxone works in the laboratory
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
method but what i think you're getting
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
at center daniels is
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
how do we know it's getting to the right
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
people and that it's being effective
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
if we look at our um amr
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies reports from
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua you see last year
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
a very significant change happened it
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
used to be most naloxone was being
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
delivered by the ambulance the truck
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
when it arrives to uh to us a scene of
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
an opioid overdose
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and now it switched
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
they were finding that more naloxone was
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
being arriving
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
and administered by a bystander compared
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
to the ambulance so that was a very key
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
data point we're tracking
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
about that we're also tracking where the
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
naloxone is going you know through the
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
doorways we we keep good records on
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
where it's happening you know where
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
which how much is going to
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
we've embarked this summer on reaching
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
out and connecting visiting the doorways
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
um they're telling me that it's being
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
adequately it's being used but they need
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
more what's happening with the border
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
and more fentanyl coming into the
 
01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.470 align:start position:0%
and more fentanyl coming into the
country

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the recent
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
news over the last few months of some
 
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
increase in spikes across the country
 
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.270 align:start position:0%
increase in spikes across the country
with

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
more um
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
exposure to fentanyl has required more
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
naloxone to combat this and that's
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
partly why this is is really um critical
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
now that we uh shore up make sure that
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
that the supply of naloxone as part of
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
the overall larger pro
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
program that we have that's been so
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
successful for new hampshire compared to
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
um so that i hope that answers your
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you follow-up
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
do uh would we track
 
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
do uh would we track
any

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
have any data to indicate if the
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
recipients of naloxone are entering a
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
we do in the fact that they enter into
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
the doorway system so when the doorway
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
when they come through the doorways
 
01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.149 align:start position:0%
when they come through the doorways
we

01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.709 --> 01:17:08.719 align:start position:0%
do an intake process and we were making
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
those referrals warm handoffs care
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
coordination trying to close the loop
 
01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder though is a you
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
know remitting relapsing disease
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so we see it's all parts of
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
recovery that some some people
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
will not
 
01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.870 align:start position:0%
will not
um

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know would not successfully maintain
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
their sobriety of the of the illness
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
essentially maintain it in recovery for
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
treatment and we'll have relapses
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately there will be some
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
individuals who may be revived more than
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
once but what that does is it allows
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
that person to still be alive and still
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a chance to to to achieve recovery
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
through our partners
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you brought up manchester and
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
nashua because while
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
the statewide opioid deaths may be down
 
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
are both on track this year to have an
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
increase of about a third
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
versus a year ago so something is
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
something is wrong in our two largest
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
cities what
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
improvements is the department going to
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
make with the doorways
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
to bring nashua and manchester
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
down in opioid deaths as the rest of the
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you senator rosenwald so just
 
01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
recently i had an opportunity to visit
 
01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
the doorway there in manchester and see
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
the good work that's being done and
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
they're really um you know doubling down
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
on um sharing up the linkages that they
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
have with community partners
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
such as farnham and others
 
01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.470 align:start position:0%
such as farnham and others
to

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
to get more people transitioned earlier
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
more timely into these
 
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
more timely into these
uh

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
treatment programs
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
we're also wanting to make sure that we
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
have adequate levels of naloxone in
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
those communities
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
and then part of it though is beyond the
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
treatment system part of it is beyond
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
drug pattern pattern problems as well i
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
think there's others here as well that
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
could speak to the nut you know the
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
non-treatment aspects of it
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
that may be contributing to that
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
pfas in the landfills
which

01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
represented emeric also brought up
 
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.430 align:start position:0%
represented emeric also brought up
okay

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:30.620 align:start position:0%
so we now
 
01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:31.910 align:start position:0%
so we now
[Music]

01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
this is that big book that that you all
 
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:58.870 align:start position:0%
this is that big book that that you all
received

01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair

the lba
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
um these two uh reports the single audit
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
report the big one and then the small uh
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
management letter our product of uh kpmg
 
01:24:18.149 --> 01:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
we retain them from the single audit and
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
the management letter is a byproduct of
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
both the
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
state act for audit as well as the
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
single audit
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
joining us from kpmg is barack romano
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
the partner
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
on the engagement and with him is
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%

and then from department of
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
administrative services is commissioner
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
house and dana
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
to call our comptroller so i believe
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
dana has a couple of opening remarks and
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
then she'll
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
good morning dana call state comptroller
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
my office is responsible for working
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
with both teams to get this document put
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
out for you
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
we are a little later in the cycle than
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
normal for this is an fy21
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
document and we're closing fy22 right
 
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
now as we speak in fact today so um we
 
01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:17.669 align:start position:0%
now as we speak in fact today so um we
are

01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
we were allowed the last two years due
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
to the covid pandemic we were allowed a
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
little extra time to get the single
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
audit work done
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
typically it is out
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
so after the fiscal year closes we
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
usually have nine months to get it out
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
so it's usually the following march
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
they provided an extension all the way
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
out excuse me until this september
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
however we stru we were striving to get
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
it done by june 30th so that was that
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
was our goal and similar to the last
 
01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.189 align:start position:0%
was our goal and similar to the last
year

01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
so you have a handout there are a couple
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
little tweaks on the finding numbers we
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
put the handout together a few weeks
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
before we had sort of finalized the
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
categories of findings but in general
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
the total findings are
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
portrayed for you as a 36 35 36 that's
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
about where we're at for
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
in total for material weaknesses and
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies
 
01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.669 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies
and

01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
based on i gave you sort of the total
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that are subject to
 
01:26:14.159 --> 01:26:15.110 align:start position:0%
federal dollars that are subject to
audit

01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
not everything gets audited every year
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's a cycle for determining and the
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
auditors will let you know how how they
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
do that but
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
basically the federal funds have
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
as you are aware continued to climb uh
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
we were typically for year after year
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
after year about 2.3 billion we went to
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
3.6 billion and now 4.3 billion
 
01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
soon to be another billion
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
we're counting billions now which is a
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
little scary um
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
this what we had through fiscal 21
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect any arpa funds
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
so what we reflect through fiscal 21
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
was essentially the cares act money that
 
01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
came the coronavirus relief fund the
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
first billion
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot of programs like
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
education and medicaid and others got
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
other funding sources in addition to the
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund that was
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
administered through the gopher office
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
so really it's um you're seeing between
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.910 align:start position:0%
this year
uh

01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
between fiscal 21 and fiscal 22 what
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
we'll present to you
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
a year from now is sort of the wrap up
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the first billion the coronavirus the
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
first 1.25 billion which is the
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
chronobytes relief fund and then
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that you'll start to see
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
the arpa funding coming through these
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
reports so there's a there's a big delay
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
when something is provided to the state
 
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
when we've allocated it to
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
whomever is going to spend it and then
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
when it actually gets spent so just keep
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
that in mind but um the good news is
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
even with the extensive additional
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
federal funding our our audit findings
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
we believe are manageable
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
similar themes a lot of it with
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
compliance findings is a technicality
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
unlike the act for audit where we have
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
some level of materiality in terms of
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
determining whether findings that get
 
01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
presented to you how significant they
 
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.149 align:start position:0%
presented to you how significant they
are

01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
compliance findings are reported
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
essentially regardless so it tends to be
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
a higher number of findings but we look
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
at sort of the material weaknesses and
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
try to keep that in check
 
01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.709 align:start position:0%
try to keep that in check
so

01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:31.189 --> 01:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i want to thank my team in admin
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
services because um again we've
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing this with our existing staff
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and we're hoping you know again to
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
expand that as the arpa funds come
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
through because there is a lot of a lot
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
of audit work that gets done sort of at
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
the tail end so
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
but we have it we have it under control
 
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.430 align:start position:0%
but we have it we have it under control
and

01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has anything to add
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
nope he's here for questions so we'll be
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions after kpmg
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you dana for the record my name is
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
brock romano i'm the lead auto partner
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
both on the acfor as well as the single
 
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.030 align:start position:0%
both on the acfor as well as the single
audit

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
brianna risco is joining me today she's
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
one of two senior managers who helped
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
with the uniform guidance or the audit
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
of federal awards given given the
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
complexity of it so what i want to do
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
this morning is maybe just make a few
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
brief comments on the telephone book
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's in front of you
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
and then ask brienne to kind of go into
 
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:28.790 align:start position:0%
and then ask brienne to kind of go into
some

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
some level of detail
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
happy to go into more detail
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
if there's questions that the committee
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
has so in just in terms of of the
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
telephone book just just to kind of give
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
you an idea of the contents uh there's
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
multiple tabs in here and i just want to
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk briefly about those tabs so there's
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
a tab
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the financial statements and so that
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
that section is actually the act for and
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
that was presented to the fiscal
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
committee back in in january of this
 
01:29:58.719 --> 01:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
committee back in in january of this
year

01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.950 align:start position:0%
year
um

01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
the next section is is our reports on
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
inter uh on compliance and internal
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
controls there's actually two reports in
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
there one of them is a report on
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
internal controls related to the act for
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
and again that's reproduced here but
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
that was presented to the committee back
 
01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:19.189 align:start position:0%
that was presented to the committee back
in

01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
in january of this year and then the
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
other report is a a report on internal
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
controls on federal programs
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh not an opinion but a report on
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
internal controls and then we actually
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
give a compliance uh opinion as soon
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
assuming we give an audit opinion on
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
compliance for those largest programs
 
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we audit and you know brienne will
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
get into that in a little in a little
 
01:30:42.629 --> 01:30:42.639 align:start position:0%
more detail as well
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh and then there's a section called the
 
01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh c4 the schedule of expenditures of
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
federal awards think of that as the
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a financial statement so
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is where we would list
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
all of the 300 or so programs
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire spent
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
during the year
 
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
during the year
and

01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a summary page uh that
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna flip to later on that'll let
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
you see that visually and maybe a page
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
or two instead of trying to digest
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh 27 pages i
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
and then there's a section on current
 
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
year findings so there's 36 total
 
01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:18.950 align:start position:0%
year findings so there's 36 total
findings

01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
findings
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
one of them relates to the act for which
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
again was presented and reproduced here
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's 35
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
findings relative to your federal awards
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
again brienne will go into a little bit
 
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
more detail on that but just just to
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
give the committee a sense of of the
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
contents then the last tab is a section
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
of of status of prior year findings and
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
so findings
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
basically stay in that
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
section until they're resolved and or
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
the federal government expresses no
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
further action usually that happens
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
after a period of time two or three
 
01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
years i might just make the general
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
when we do our audit when we identify a
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
finding we're typically well into the
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year so the life cycle of a
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
compliance finding typically has two
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
years so you know don't be alarmed if
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
you see a finding that maybe you know
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
spans two audit reports but you might
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
want to pay attention to findings that
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
stay on three four
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh that are more chronic and brienne
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
will will mention a little bit of that
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
so now if you'll indulge me i'm going to
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
actually maybe have you flip into a page
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
or two so just beyond the table of
 
01:32:26.239 --> 01:32:27.350 align:start position:0%
or two so just beyond the table of
contents

01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
contents
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh after the um introduction letter
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's uh page number b2 and b3
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
and so i i point this page out because
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
this this lets you see in two pages all
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
in a summary fashion the 4.6 billion
 
01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
in a summary fashion the 4.6 billion
dollars

01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:32:46.629 --> 01:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire spent dana had
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned it and it's broken out by
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
something called type a programs which
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
which are basically your largest
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
programs state of new hampshire
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
typically has you know less than 30 of
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
those largest programs with just a
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
handful medicaid uh unemployment this
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
year coronavirus relief fund
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
you know making up the majority of the
 
01:33:06.719 --> 01:33:07.669 align:start position:0%
you know making up the majority of the
spend

01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:33:07.679 --> 01:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
spend
so

01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
rather than go through through 26 pages
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
of detail this allows you to see
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
in a quick snapshot kind of you know
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
what the spending would look like
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
again uh trying to be high level here if
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
we want to go into more detail happy to
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
do it and then the the next
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
page that i might ask you to flip to
 
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.229 align:start position:0%
page that i might ask you to flip to
is

01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
is in the tab called current year
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
findings in question cost
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
that first page f-1
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
for folks of my generation i call this
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
the cliff notes version of the uniform
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
guidance report it summarizes on just a
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
couple of pages
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
basically the audit results
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
and so the top of the page is reserved
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
for the financial statements again
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
reproduce we've already discussed it
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
the middle of the page talks about the
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
federal awards that's kind of what we're
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
here to talk about
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
it it lets you know that we identified
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
some findings that
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
have material weaknesses again most
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
severe category of control findings some
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
findings had significant deficiencies
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
the the middle category if you will
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then it lists the programs where
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
detail out the the programs that had a
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
qualified opinion
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
qualified in the sense that there was
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
some compliance element that they that
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh materially adhered to think
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
about allowability think about finance
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
federal reporting
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
think about
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient monitoring those are the
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
types of compliance areas that we test
 
01:34:38.790 --> 01:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
and if and if there's a big enough
 
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.830 align:start position:0%
and if and if there's a big enough
problem

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh in that area we would qualify so
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
here's the programs that had a
 
01:34:43.119 --> 01:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
here's the programs that had a
qualification

01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
qualification
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
the remaining programs we looked at were
 
01:34:47.119 --> 01:34:48.709 align:start position:0%
the remaining programs we looked at were
unqualified

01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
unqualified
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
and then on the next uh page it
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
on the next page it shows the 18 largest
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
programs that we looked at
 
01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.470 align:start position:0%
programs that we looked at
so

01:34:58.470 --> 01:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a real high level of of
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
what the telephone book has
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh we do want to pull you down into a
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
little detail i've asked brienne to kind
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
of prepare some comments about some
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
things that that might be of interest to
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
the committee and with that i'd like to
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%

01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.510 --> 01:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you bro good morning for the
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is brianna risco
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
as brock mentioned as part of the 2021
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
uniform guidance audit we focused on 18
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
of your largest programs
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
the uniform guidance does not require us
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
to look at programs every single year
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
there's some risk assessment guidance
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
that we're allowed to apply
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
looking at prior year audit results
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
dollar spends as well as certain
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
programs that the office of management
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
and budget designates as what are called
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
higher risk programs
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
so for
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
2021 omb did designate the medicaid
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
program as a higher risk program this
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
program is higher risk every year
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
by omb they also designated some of the
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
covid programs as higher risk education
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund coronavirus relief
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
fund and the emergency rental assistance
 
01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.430 align:start position:0%
fund and the emergency rental assistance
program

01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
were three of those programs that were
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
designated higher risk that we looked at
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
as part of the audit
 
01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
the 18 programs that we focused on
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
constituted about 3.9 billion of the
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
total 4.6 billion reported on the cfa or
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent of your total spend
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
six of the 18 programs were also audited
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
as part of the 2020 audit um last year's
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
audit and were required to be audited
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
again because of the severity of the
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
findings identified during 2020
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
those included medicaid the unemployment
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
program title one temporary assistance
 
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
foster care and opioid
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
so programs managed across a couple of
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
the state's different departments
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then one of the programs the
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
coronavirus relief fund
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
was also audited as part of 2020 and
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
re-audited as part of 2021 simply
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
because it was designated higher risk
 
01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
there were no findings identified as
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
part of the 2020 audit
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
brock and dana both covered this a
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
there were a total of 36 findings one
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
for the act for 35 for the uniform
 
01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.870 align:start position:0%
for the act for 35 for the uniform
guidance

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
16 of the 35 were considered to be
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses and 19 of them were
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
considered to be significant
 
01:37:21.199 --> 01:37:23.270 align:start position:0%
considered to be significant
deficiencies

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
and of the 35 findings that were
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
reported for 2021 uh seven of them um
 
01:37:30.310 --> 01:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
were repeated comments of those that
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
so based on the results of our audit we
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
issued an opinion on each of the 18
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
programs that we audited which are
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
summarized for you on that page f1
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
for nine of the 18 programs we issued a
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
qualified or a modified opinion that
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
included the supplemental nutrition
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
assistance program snap the unemployment
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
program the coronavirus relief fund the
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance program the
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
education stabilization fund the
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
epidemiology and laboratory capacity
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
grants program the temporary assistance
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
program the lie heat program and the
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid program
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
each of these nine programs had findings
 
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
that were considered to be material
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
instances of non-compliance and in some
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
cases material weaknesses and internal
 
01:38:21.199 --> 01:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
cases material weaknesses and internal
control

01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
control
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
the medicaid program additionally has a
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
scope limitation noted as part of the
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
2021 audit which is consistent with the
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the nine programs that we issued a
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
qualified opinion for three of them also
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
had qualified opinions as part of the
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
2020 audit that includes unemployment
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
tanf and medicaid
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
and tanf and medicaid have had qualified
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
opinions for at least the past three
 
01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.189 align:start position:0%
opinions for at least the past three
years

01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the 11 remaining programs
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
had an unmodified or a clean opinion for
 
01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.030 align:start position:0%
had an unmodified or a clean opinion for
2021

01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
the findings themselves begin on page f7
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
beginning with finding 2021 0 0 2
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
0 0 1 relates to the financial
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
statements and was presented to you
 
01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:12.790 align:start position:0%
statements and was presented to you
previously

01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
and finally each of the findings that is
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
included in the report
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
management is required to provide a
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
response to the finding which is noted
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of each of the findings
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
and they're also required to provide a
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan to resolve the
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
matters that are identified
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan are they are
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
included within the report
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
and then as outlined in our opinion the
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
state is responsible for preparing a
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and the state's responses and what was
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
included in those is not subject to our
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
audit opinion and so we do not express
 
01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
is there any questions i can answer on
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
the 2021 audit report
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you how does the
 
01:39:58.239 --> 01:39:59.189 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you how does the
program

01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
earn the designation of high risk
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
the high-risk programs are designated by
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
the office of management and budget so
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
each year when they put out the
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
compliance supplement they designate
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
certain programs to be higher risk
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
typically it includes only the medicaid
 
01:40:14.639 --> 01:40:15.750 align:start position:0%
typically it includes only the medicaid
program

01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's always a high risk program with the
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
outflow of funding related to covid they
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
started designating some of those
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
programs that get a significant amount
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
of covid dollars as higher risk as well
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
but that designation um is given solely
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
by the office of management and budget
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay and just could you elaborate a
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's programs i think where omb has
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
determined that there's a high risk of
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with federal regulations
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
so if you think about the medicaid
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
program for example there's very complex
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements to depend on
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
are you eligible for medicaid and if you
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
are which um
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
benefits span or eligibility program are
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
you in fact eligible for it's a complex
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
calculation many things go into it so i
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
think because of that for one example
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
omb feels that medicaid is a higher risk
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
program and feels that there could be a
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
high risk of non-compliance or misuse of
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
federal dollars okay thank you and final
 
01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.790 align:start position:0%
federal dollars okay thank you and final
question

01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:16.470 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned earlier that some of
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
the some of the times you see after two
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
or three years that things just drop off
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh is there a reason for that or is that
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
the federal government decides this
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
isn't important anymore and we've wasted
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
our time for two or three years or
 
01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
i think the answer would be twofold so
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
in most cases by the time we identify a
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
finding as part of the audit you're well
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
into your next
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:44.229 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
so

01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
by nature of having identified it
 
01:41:48.629 --> 01:41:48.639 align:start position:0%
halfway through your next fiscal year it
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
would live likely again on our next
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
audit report just giving the timing of
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
when the audit happens
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
um in the case of things kind of falling
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
off in some cases federal departments
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
will write directly to say your
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
and say the audit finding that kpmg
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
noted in their report from x year had to
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
do with this we feel that you have
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
provided sufficient documentation since
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
then to resolve that item and
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
federal hhs will say we now consider
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
this finding to be closed
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
um so in that case we would review that
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
letter um and make sure that
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
we agree that that finding is in fact
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
closed good thank you
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
represent leishman
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
thanks madam cheer
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
is it all right that we venture to the
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
management letter or are we still on the
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
phone book
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
no please they're shaking their head yes
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
maybe before we just leave this i just
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
we threw a lot of stuff at you yeah your
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
head's probably spinning
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
let me try to put some of this in
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
context so i've worked on several
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
statewide single audits
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
california new york massachusetts new
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire illinois
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
the results here i would say are middle
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the pack right
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
there are other states that that have
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
many more findings more severe findings
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
lots of question costs
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
um and there are some states that quite
 
01:43:16.159 --> 01:43:17.350 align:start position:0%
um and there are some states that quite
frankly

01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
have less
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
findings less qualifications than you do
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
but but my experience having worked on
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
on several states
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
you're kind of middle of the pack uh in
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the states that i kind of
 
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned and and so i
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh you hear all these things material
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
weakness qualifications in your head
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
must be spinning you know what
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
what what's happened it is very hard to
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
run these programs with these levels of
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
complexity without
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
some degree of hiccups and and really
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
what we look for
 
01:43:51.990 --> 01:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
is the is the adjudication of those
 
01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:54.719 align:start position:0%
items right are they rolling off
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and we've been satisfied both
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
with the department response
 
01:44:01.590 --> 01:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
as well as a supervision from das and
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
the lba that you know new hampshire's
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
got a very good handle on its federal
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
program so i i don't want to i don't
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
want to dwell on the uniform guidance
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
but i also want to try to put some of
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
that into context for the members
 
01:44:15.510 --> 01:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
i apologize if oh happy to go to the
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
management no problem no problem
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
whatsoever yes uh
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
you may
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
i i have a 30 000 foot question because
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm a new kid to this committee this
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
is only my second year so i'm learning
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that this audit is
 
01:44:35.109 --> 01:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
really done for the federal government
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
correct okay then that that i'm
 
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.109 align:start position:0%
correct okay then that that i'm
i'm

01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
got my feet on the ground again because
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
i was trying to figure out who's
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
auditing who and why
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
and it looks like this is our report
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
through you to the federal government
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
about how we're handling their funding
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
they want some
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.669 --> 01:44:57.679 align:start position:0%
oversight of their spend just like you
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
want oversight of your spend and that
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
this product does it for them and just
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
as a curiosity do they do they fund this
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
they they
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
allow the auto costs to be funded uh
 
01:45:09.199 --> 01:45:10.709 align:start position:0%
allow the auto costs to be funded uh
oftentimes

01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
oftentimes
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
um uh the grant dollars are capped and
 
01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
they would rather use grant dollars for
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
direct assistance
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
than um uh put audit costs in front of
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
programmatic dollars so uh
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes they're allowable but not always
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
utilized that's a fair statement to dana
 
01:45:28.719 --> 01:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
utilized that's a fair statement to dana
and

01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:32.950 align:start position:0%
and
right

01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes but when you approve an item through
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
this mechanism you'll see an audit fund
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
set aside uh budget
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's that covers this cost
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the most part and i
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
um i was going to add that the federal
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
cognizant agencies can audit our
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
agencies directly as well uh this was
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be sort of a
 
01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be sort of a
comprehensive

01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
look but they'll come in individually
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
and audit a program on their own as well
 
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
and uh those those sort of happen
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
few and far between but they do happen
 
01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:05.270 align:start position:0%
few and far between but they do happen
so

01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt thank you madam chair
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
so my question really is is that
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
interplay between this audit and the
 
01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:15.350 align:start position:0%
interplay between this audit and the
program

01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
specific audits
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
so for example recently the three-year
 
01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
audit of the opioid treatment programs
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
where we have to pay the federal
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
government back like almost a million
 
01:46:28.239 --> 01:46:29.510 align:start position:0%
government back like almost a million
dollars

01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
is that captured anywhere in
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
these or is it because it goes back a
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
few years it's not
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
it will come up in an audit depending on
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
the timing so
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh the same types of things that that
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
federal agency found
 
01:46:52.629 --> 01:46:52.639 align:start position:0%
if it's one of the programs that kpmg
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
audits they will likely find similar
 
01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:56.239 align:start position:0%
findings i guess that's what i would say
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
there uh that particular one that you
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
talked about was
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay our are you moving to the
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
management report or are you still in
 
01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
management report or are you still in
the

01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm whenever we're telephone letter the
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
management letter here okay
 
01:47:17.590 --> 01:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
so all right go ahead thanks madam chair
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you all for being here
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
so representative edwards had a question
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
he couldn't be here today so he asked me
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
to ask the question so on page three
 
01:47:30.239 --> 01:47:31.350 align:start position:0%
to ask the question so on page three
um

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
down we have recommendations that says
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
management should reinforce policies and
 
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.350 align:start position:0%
management should reinforce policies and
procedures

01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's an implied i guess feeling there
 
01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:41.189 align:start position:0%
there's an implied i guess feeling there
that

01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures but do you folks
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
go and look at those policies and
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
procedures that you're recommending that
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question so the
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
answer is yes we do we first
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
we have to audit to something and
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
normally we audit to the existing
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
policies or procedures if if there
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
aren't adequate existing policies and
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
procedures we would then look to our
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
best practices across our client base
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so in this particular case for this
 
01:48:17.590 --> 01:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
particular finding uh the uh the policy
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
of de-provisioning somebody who is
 
01:48:19.679 --> 01:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
of de-provisioning somebody who is
terminated

01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
terminated
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh is when um the uh
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh it department is notified
 
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:30.070 align:start position:0%
uh it department is notified
and

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we compare that against so that's
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a passive policy right we wait
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
to be notified and once we're notified
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
we will de-provision somebody and we
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
looked at that whether that's kind of
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
adequate or maybe they should be more
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
proactive should they be doing something
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh to try to gather that information as
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to waiting for it to come in
 
01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we felt that that policy was their
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
policy was adequate given the uh the
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
technology and the and the uh the users
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
of that talk technology because they
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
weren't as decentralized so for example
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
if we were talking about new hampshire
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
first which would be the statewide
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
accounting system multiple departments
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies sitting back and
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
waiting for uh notification might not be
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
a best practice for that policy uh
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
whereas for uh new heights uh even
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
though it's dealing with a large federal
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
agency we thought that policy was
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
adequate so
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's a long answer to a simple
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
question but hopefully
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
it addressed the question that you asked
 
01:49:29.109 --> 01:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
i i think it probably did thank you
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair
 
01:49:34.229 --> 01:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
do it just up yes go ahead thank you
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
very thank you very much
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
just a quick quick comment brock i've
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
been around for these audits for the
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
last 24 years
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's been it's been a wonderful
 
01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.830 align:start position:0%
uh it's been it's been a wonderful
experience

01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
i remember the bad audits that we heard
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes the very bad audits that we heard
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
from your entity vis-a-vis
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
our state government i think what i've
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
seen in the last few years
 
01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.629 align:start position:0%
seen in the last few years
is

01:50:00.629 --> 01:50:00.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
improvement change
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
high level work on the part of the state
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
and high level work on the part of of
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
your organization in terms of the
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
reports the reports are better they're
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
more consistent they're well done and
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
well articulated so i complement you and
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
i complement the comptroller
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know many years we went without a
 
01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.470 align:start position:0%
you know many years we went without a
comptroller

01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
comptroller
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that was a
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
very difficult period for us here in the
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
state we couldn't fill those jobs
 
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.350 align:start position:0%
state we couldn't fill those jobs
hopefully

01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
we have a lasting comptroller as we
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
speak but i just want to point out to
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a a dramatic change over
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
over the years these audits uh uh
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint i'm much better uh
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i think we're doing a a a much much
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
better job i can remember deficiencies
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
that were pointed out in in the at other
 
01:50:59.589 --> 01:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
times that were very costly to the state
 
01:51:01.350 --> 01:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
kudos to you for the job well done not
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
i know charlie wanted to mention that if
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
if we're wrapping up questions we just
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge that brock is
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
rolling off the state audit uh and we're
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
going to have a new kpmg partner
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
marie zimmerman is coming back so a
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
familiar face but we uh it's been a
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
great working relationship with brock so
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
we will miss him
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
kudos to brock no question
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
i i have to say something because uh so
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
brock has been involved in the audit or
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
the single audit for the state since
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
like the 1940s i think something like
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
that but for a very long time but um
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's very rare that um
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
that you enjoy your relationship with
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
your auditor it's sort of like saying i
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
have a great proctologist
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
but um but in this particular case um we
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
did enjoy it and the state is uh
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
although there's a there's another great
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
auditor coming but the state is going to
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
miss brock and you're going to miss
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
brock and
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i can't promise senator d'alessandro
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that we'll have another italian either
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
so on behalf of the state of new
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire and and all of its people
 
01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:12.210 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:12.210 --> 01:52:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
i i'm embarrassed and uncalled for but i
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
and though and uh i will just say i i
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
got more than i gave in the 20 or so
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
years i've been here it's been a great
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
pleasure and truly enjoyed uh uh
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%

state of new hampshire has uh
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
