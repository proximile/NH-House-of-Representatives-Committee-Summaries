00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
i am opening the committee of conference
 
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1460
 
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is the off-label
 
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
relative to the off-label use of
 
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and relative to
 
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy prescriptions
 
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
in the senate um there was work done to
 
00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is a little bit
 
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
more understanding of what's going on
 
00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
there the language included a form
 
00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
created by the board of medicine or the
 
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
board of nursing
 
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
to be approved
 
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's a question about how much time
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
and effort that would take for the board
 
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
of medicine and also making sure that we
 
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
are referencing other uses of off-label
 
00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
medicine so we have a proposed amendment
 
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
that um takes most of the words that we
 
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
had already
 
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
approved in both of the committees and
 
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
adds a little bit more detail to flesh
 
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
it out
 
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.070 align:start position:0%
it out
and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
and get more to the point and provide
 
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
more protection
 
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
so the way that it would read would be
 
00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire confirms that
 
00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start position:0%
strong support for shared decision
 
00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
making between health care professionals
 
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
and their patients a licensee may
 
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
lawfully prescribe an fda approved drug
 
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
product for an off-label
 
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
indication and to be held at the same
 
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
standard of care as when prescribing for
 
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
an online label indication with a
 
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
off-label use of the drug product for
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
this indication as long-standing common
 
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
use this is really important because 70
 
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
of prescriptions i've seen a number as
 
00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
high as 70 of prescriptions are off
 
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
label and this protects the routine
 
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
practice where the doctor may not even
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
know that there's an improve that
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not that indication has been
 
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
approved for that drug
 
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
so when that's the case keep practicing
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
as you do
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
b is when there is medical evidence to
 
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
support this use and no known evidence
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
contraindicating such use including but
 
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
not limited to peer-reviewed studies and
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
practice guidelines from relevant
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
medical societies
 
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
we had had the word sound scientific
 
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
evidence a sound scientific medical
 
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
evidence a sound scientific medical
evidence

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the question was raised by several
 
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
people who determines what sound
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed publications and medical
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
society guidelines are sound so if we
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
can point to those and there's no no
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
concerns that would be widely known
 
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
about that indication and that drug
 
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
it should be routine use as well that
 
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't need any particular
 
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.350 align:start position:0%
doesn't need any particular
documentation

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
now we move to that area where it hasn't
 
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
been adopted by societies or there's not
 
00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
a large body of evidence in the
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed papers
 
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
this is that area where we may have one
 
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
like our colleague from walpole who was
 
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
able to have her husband benefit from
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
innovative therapeutics for his cancer
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
where he was one of the first people
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
treated there was no body of evidence at
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
that point there was no data there was a
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
hope that it might help him and it did
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that people
 
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire are able to
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from that so long as they and
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
their doctor know what is going on
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to those core
 
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
principles of informed consent that are
 
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
laid out in the american medical
 
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.309 align:start position:0%
laid out in the american medical
association

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
their medical code of ethics
 
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
opinion on informed consent which
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
requires that you present relevant
 
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
information accurately accurately and
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
sensitively in keeping with the
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
patient's preferences for receiving
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
medical information the position should
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
include information about the burdens
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
risks and its expected benefits of all
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
options including foregoing treatment
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate to have a pharmacist on
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
this committee of conference with us and
 
00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
there's been some improvements made
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
since uh this was drafted at ols
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
thanks to representative merchant
 
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
thanks to representative merchant
he's

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
recognized that we need to have a form
 
00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
that can be faxed to the pharmacist so
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist knows that this informed
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
consent has happened
 
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
this would be changing section c
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
to read
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
the licensee has provided and the
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
patient or the if the patient is a minor
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
the patient's parent or guardian has
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
signed an informed consent form that
 
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.469 align:start position:0%
signed an informed consent form that
includes

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
the known potential benefits known
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
potential risks alternative treatment
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
options expected prognosis without
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
treatment and a disclosure that the
 
00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
prescription is for an off-label
 
00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
prescription is for an off-label
indication

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
the signed informed consent form shall
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
remain a part of the patient's medical
 
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.510 align:start position:0%
remain a part of the patient's medical
record

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think with that and with these changes
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
we have a pretty comprehensive look and
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
i'd like to look to senator sherman for
 
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
his input
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair this has
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
uh i talked to the board of medicine
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
today and uh we also reached lindsay
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
courtney to just confirm that
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
they're okay with this and i spoke
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
with them directly and they are fine
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
with it it really does capture
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
their concerns
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
about the bill that were there before i
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that we are
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
c will be modified at the three spots
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
not just the one dealing with physicians
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
but it will be modified lines 13 through
 
00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
but it will be modified lines 13 through
16

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
16
 
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 align:start position:0%
lines 28 through 31
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.270 align:start position:0%
lines 28 through 31
[Music]

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
and then yes
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
through fourteen on page two correct yes
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's correct unfortunately it's the
 
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
same language all the time yeah i just
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
wanna make sure that we're not just
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
amending that one section
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that's all i'm support
 
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.189 align:start position:0%
so that's all i'm support
um

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
can we read again
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant's language
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
because i think the way it's written
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
here it doesn't include everything that
 
00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
you said
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
and do it slowly so that
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
my penmanship can keep up with you
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you that's why i opened us just
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
a few moments later uh then we had it
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
would read the licensee has provided and
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
yup got it the patient's parent or
 
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.350 align:start position:0%
yup got it the patient's parent or
guardian

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's why i went to another piece of
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that includes yeah
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
and that goes to the language there the
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
known potential benefits okay and then
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
the rest is what was on representative
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
i want to read this again out loud
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
the licensee has provided
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
and the patient
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
or if the patient is a
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
minor and the patient's parent or
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
guardian has signed an informed consent
 
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.189 align:start position:0%
guardian has signed an informed consent
form

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
form
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
that includes the known potential
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
benefits known potential risks
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment options expected
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
prognosis without treatment and the
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure that the prescription is for
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
an off-label indication
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
then the addition of the sentence the
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
signed informed consent form
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
shall remain part of the medical record
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
of the patient's medical record that's
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the pt there yes she'll remain part of
 
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.710 align:start position:0%
the pt there yes she'll remain part of
the

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
patients that wasn't in there either
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
it's written for an artist
okay

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
all right okay
 
00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.309 align:start position:0%
all right okay
um

can i ask one question
 
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.550 align:start position:0%

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.749 align:start position:0%
um
john

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
john
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
leon if i could respond to senator
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
bradley's question for the record john
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
williams director of legislative affairs
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
the department is fine with this we did
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that the primary principal
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
agencies involved was the office of
 
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
and the board of medicine and we we
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um earnest effort made by
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
the uh conferee chair for the house to
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
reaching out to various parties and we
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
are fine thank you okay thank you
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
paula you're good to go
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
you've talked to lindsay
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
and the board of medicine all right i'd
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
move that to senator seed to the
 
00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.710 align:start position:0%
move that to senator seed to the
amendment

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
um normally i would say
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we should come back
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
and review this
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't think it's necessary in this
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
case um so the sooner it gets done
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
in case there's there's a lot of moving
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
parts here in my penmanship it should
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
all be good
 
00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to come back
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll make sure that we have
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
this language if we have anything we
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
have the tape and we'll make sure that
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is done quickly so that we can all
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
sign off and if there's a problem fix
 
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.110 align:start position:0%
sign off and if there's a problem fix
that

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you what does the house agree to
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
the this amendment
 
00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.070 align:start position:0%
the this amendment
yes

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.150 align:start position:0%
yes yes
yes

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
then if the senate agrees then we have
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment it'll be drafted and we
 
00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
can sign off and i will close the
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee of conference for house bill
 
00:10:08.720 --> 00:40:58.150 align:start position:0%
committee of conference for house bill
1466.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
i call the committee of conference on
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 1487 to order
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is relative to procedure for
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from the vaccine registry
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
this bill allows
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
a notarized form to be used instead of
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
going to the healthcare provider in
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
order to withdraw from the vaccine
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
registry the senate had been concerned
 
00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
about the differentiation between
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
parents and children and actually came
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
up with some beautiful language that
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
addresses the
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're facing
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
in the current health care shortage
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
the senate said
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
that the form shall require the
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
signature of a health care provider
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i think that we believe that that's
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
something that should apply both to
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
children and adults
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
and that children adults should also be
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
able to have a notarized form signed by
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
either the patient or the patient's
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
parent and guardian if they are a minor
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
of course there are some consequences to
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
taking responsibility for your own data
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
and your own health
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
which is what anybody who is choosing to
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the registry does
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you withdraw from the registry and
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
you show up in the emergency room
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
they're not just going to be able to
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
call up your vaccination record and say
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
that you've been immunized against
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
measles or that you've been immunized
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
against covid and so you may be treated
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
in such a way as somebody who hasn't
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
been immunized and they'll be they'll be
 
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
been immunized and they'll be they'll be
different

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
different diagnostic workups that you go
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
through and you might be in a bubble
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
room as well
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment that
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
allows a form to be notarized
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
notarized or by a healthcare provider
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
which means that you don't need to be
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
your healthcare provider which is great
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
in this day and age when too many are
 
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.069 align:start position:0%
in this day and age when too many are
retiring

00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
retiring
 
00:42:38.079 --> 00:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
retiring
or

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
other changes in practice mean that
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
you're no longer with your existing
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
we also have some language that
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
addresses some concerns from the
 
00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:47.990 align:start position:0%
addresses some concerns from the
department

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
the forum is created by the department
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
and that's done in the rules process
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
so if when we add the language the form
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
provided by the department shall include
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
information and consequences that the
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility to maintain vaccination
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
records becomes the responsibility of
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
the patient or the patient's parent or
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
guardian if a minor
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
we give them that ability to put that
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
information in that form
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think we all believe that that's very
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
important because when you take
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility you need to understand
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
what that responsibility is just like
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
some of our parents may have had a
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination card when we were enrolling
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
in school and they had to show that
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
every time you went to camp if you
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
choose not to be in the registry that's
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
probably what things are going to look
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
like for you but if you don't want to be
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the registry that's a burden you're
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
willing to bear
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
so i i guess we'll see if there's any
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions here and then we can have the
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
department uh share specifically what
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
consequences they think that people need
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
to be aware of as well
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%

right now i would pose a slight
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
modification to it to read the forum
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
provided by the department shall include
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%

the responsibility to maintain vaccine
