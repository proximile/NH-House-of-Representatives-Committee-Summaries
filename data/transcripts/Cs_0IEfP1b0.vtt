genocide education in our classrooms is
extremely

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
00:10:44.709 --> 00:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
important and it is so important that
 
00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature and this in the the
 
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
Senate and and the governor we put it
 
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
into the adequacy portion of our our
 
00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
statutes we have a commission that's
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
been tasked with addressing how we uh
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
look at and address the teaching of this
 
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
in in our schools it comprises people
 
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
from all over the
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
state and it also involves the Cohen uh
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
Institute or school at keing State
 
00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
College and a wonderful
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
institution um what we've done in the
 
00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
amendment here the we have
 
00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh have the reporting date as 2026
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
rather than 2027 encouraging this report
 
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
and this commission to get reports to
 
00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
us and in a timely manner and also to
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
emphasize that as printed in the
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
commission responsibilities right now an
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
annual report shall be submitted onor
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
before there's a date November 1 2021
 
00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
and each year thereafter the report has
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
not been submitted
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
and we feel that report's important for
 
00:11:59.510 --> 00:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to just know what's
 
00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
going on and what progress being made
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
and we we hope that the the commission
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
we know the commission has met we're not
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
negating that we've seen the
 
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings on the website so
 
00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
with that this bill this amendment
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
simply drops the date down one year as
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
far as this act shall take uh effect
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
27 thank you Regent Miler
 
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
anything uh any further discussion from
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair could you just
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
comment about the testimony we heard was
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
that the commission thought they needed
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
four years of implementation of the bill
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
to achieve the intended
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
results so are we perceiving an earlier
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
report as kind of an interim report no
 
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
we are looking at one we have not seen
 
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
any report to date I sure you're
 
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerned that that is a concern but
 
00:13:06.709 --> 00:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
also this is a very important topic
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
given the nature of what's happening in
 
00:13:11.229 --> 00:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
our society today and stringing this out
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
for that length of a time we're trying
 
00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
to get it a little earlier so we can get
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
on with doing what we need in our
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
schools thank you anything

Belcher thank you Mr chairman I just
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
want to explain that I have a slightly
 
00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
different mind on this bill I too look
 
00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
at our um our current
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances I see what appears to be
 
00:14:56.709 --> 00:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
an unprecedented wave of hatred and an
 
00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
unprecedented wave of
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
anti-Semitism and I am deeply troubled
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
by this now we the entire State of New
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are awaiting the findings of
 
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
this committee a commission rather um
 
00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
from our legislation here to the
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
executive branch in order to proceed
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
with making recommendations um on this
 
00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
topic I think we need this report in
 
00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
hand yesterday now that's not possible
 
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
so I think November would have to do but
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not in favor of extending
 
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
it I think this is something we need to
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
um really expedite so that's that's my
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
you discussion yes please um I like this
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill and there's no question that we
 
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
have a student crisis and addressing the
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
extreme High Cost of college and higher
 
00:21:30.229 --> 00:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
education would remedy this issue and HB
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
1534 is a potential Solution by granting
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
tuition credits to truly deserving and
 
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
motivated students I believe this bill
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
has the potential to become excellent
 
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
law for those reasons however the cost
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
of the department to administer this
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
program and a few other concerns would
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately decrease the funding
 
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
available to students if this motion
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
passes I'd like to work closer with the
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor to address these concerns yet
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
all in all Morgan the high school
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
student who drafted this bill has every
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
reason to take pride not only in it but
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
also in the positive example she sets
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
for her peers to get involved in the
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%

accountability
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
into the requirement for Proficiency in
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
our schools it's a a certain concern to
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
everybody uh but I think the um punitive
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
Direction um of this um is something
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
that uh especially in uh the way it's
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
laid out um I I cannot uh support um I
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
think um my preference would be to see
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
um incentives as we have had Tri
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh I guess it was last year uh so for
 
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:30.280 align:start position:0%
that reason um uh I move
 
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
itl further discussion on the
 
00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
bill yes represent
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
leus I would love incentives we didn't
 
00:24:42.629 --> 00:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
seem to get any support on incentives
 
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
which is why I was trying this one um
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully next year we'll get we'll see
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
some incentives that's what I would like
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
to see uh
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
I do think though that we have to
 
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.550 align:start position:0%
I do think though that we have to
do

00:24:59.550 --> 00:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
something to
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
encourage schools to take a different
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
direction because the direction they're
 
00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
taking is clearly not
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
working um and as I said before I'm not
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
asking teachers to work harder I'm
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
asking them to work differently I'm
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
asking school districts to work
 
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
differently to get set goals differently
 
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
to teach reading for instance in a way
 
00:25:28.629 --> 00:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
that we know from evidence-based
 
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
research works as opposed to teaching
 
00:25:33.189 --> 00:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
reading in a way that we know doesn't
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
work and the same for
 
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.750 align:start position:0%
work and the same for
math

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
math
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
so as I said before I tried incentives I
 
00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
tried just basic
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
accountability so I'm trying this mostly
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
to hope to motivate people one way or
 
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
another to take a second look at the way
 
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
00:25:57.109 --> 00:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
education to try to
 
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
um change how we're doing things because
 
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
how we're doing things now is not
 
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
working further discussion represent
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
cordial thank you Mr chair so I was a
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill and the reason
 
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.430 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill and the reason
is

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
that I really like the fundamental idea
 
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
of trying to fix we can all agree that
 
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
education needs to be fixed and many of
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
the things we're doing are not working
 
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by all the low test scores
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
and I could go on and on about that but
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
um I like to look at things to
 
00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
understand things I like to look at
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
analogies and to me what I first thought
 
00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
of when I saw this bill
 
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
was if you go to a restaurant and you
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
are waited
 
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.669 align:start position:0%
are waited
on

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
adequately you leap 20% tip I know years
 
00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
ago it used to be 15 but nowadays you
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
leave a 20%
 
00:26:58.709 --> 00:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
tip if you're not waited on
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
adequately I well I don't leave a 20%
 
00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
tip I might leave a 10% tip if I'm
 
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
waited on very inadequately and I think
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
that does provide an incentive this is
 
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
not punitive I don't like that word I
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
would not have signed on to this if I
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
thought it was punitive we're not
 
00:27:17.709 --> 00:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
punishing the stents we're trying to
 
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
incentivize teachers and administrations
 
00:27:22.189 --> 00:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
to think outside the box and do things
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
in a different way um I work at a public
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
library as you all know and um I
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes hear that some people say If
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
This Were a business it would be out of
 
00:27:35.629 --> 00:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
business and I I have to agree so I
 
00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
think in our public institutions we need
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
to start thinking outside the box in
 
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
um you know this this analogy of of
 
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
running an effective business of seeing
 
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
it in that way and so that's why I
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this and why I will oppose
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
itl thank you very much are there is
 
00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
there further discussion represent
 
00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
Miler I don't think there's anybody
 
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I don't think there's
 
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody on this committee that's not
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about proficiency scores Etc
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
but what I'm concerned about is uh
 
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
what's available to schools to move in
 
00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.390 align:start position:0%
what's available to schools to move in
that

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
direction and when you have schools that
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
teacher uh tenure being very short you
 
00:28:22.229 --> 00:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
have Superintendent at tenure is very
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
short and they move around the issue of
 
00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
consistency in curriculum is very
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve further we've
 
00:28:31.189 --> 00:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
talked a lot in this committee about uh
 
00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
adequate adequate Aid to schools and if
 
00:28:37.629 --> 00:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
you've got a class size of 35 in a uh
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
third grade classroom or 35 in a sixth
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
grade classroom it's very hard for a
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
teacher to be able to attend to all
 
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
those issues so to me in order to begin
 
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
to really look at proficiencies you've
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
got to look at it from a systemic
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint and not did from a standpoint
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
of taking away a grant because a school
 
00:28:57.629 --> 00:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
is not as proficient as we would all
 
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
like them to be thank
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Tanner just very
 
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
quickly I I disagree with the statement
 
00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
that we all agree that's the public
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
schools are failing they're not
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
miserably failing um I've also on many
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
times in this committee talked about how
 
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
proficiency scores are a
 
00:29:23.709 --> 00:29:23.719 align:start position:0%
nebulous um score that a bar that's set
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
by um the testing and the scores that
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
are declared by the either the
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
government on the doe or at the federal
 
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
level and are not they they don't give a
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
true picture of what's happening in
 
00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
schools we don't do anything on um
 
00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
growth uh we haven't talked about growth
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
at all and I think a lot of our schools
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
are doing a great job with growth same
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
thing with reading proficiency um I'd
 
00:29:53.629 --> 00:29:53.639 align:start position:0%
also take umbrage to the statement that
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
instead of teaching things that don't
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
work if a teacher realizes that
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
something's not working and they do
 
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
every day with children because if you
 
00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
have 30 or 35 or even 15 in your class
 
00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
you have to reach those 15 kids often
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
many of them in a different way and
 
00:30:16.109 --> 00:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
teachers are trained to be flexible and
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
to to offer different ways of of
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
learning that's what happens with
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
reading unless they're they're forced
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
into a box which some of our legislation
 
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
does um so I guess that's that's I just
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't want it to go without some
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
rebuttal on that I I'd like to chime in
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
on that and follow up on what represent
 
00:30:39.189 --> 00:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
Tanner just mentioned um several years
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
back we changed how we look at the
 
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessments and the results
 
00:30:46.629 --> 00:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
from that it's not necessarily we hope
 
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
to get everybody yes in that
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
quartiles three and four two year a
 
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
little bit below for proficiency and and
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
one year way off course um but what we
 
00:30:59.229 --> 00:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
want to be looking at is growth of the
 
00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
students and there are districts which
 
00:31:03.229 --> 00:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
we absolutely know and we've done the
 
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
comparative studies too that there is a
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
relationship between certain issues uh
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
of of even if you look at poverty or
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
property valuation and the achievement
 
00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
of students uh there are a lot of
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
variables that must be considered but
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
when we see a school that's showing
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
growth and recognizing yes we need to
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
improve our math scores I'm in one of
 
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
those districts and we've gone through
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
and just overhauled the math program in
 
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
the last year or so and in the process
 
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
of doing it and professional development
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
parallels that that we're seeing
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous um attitude changes we're
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
seeing growth changes we're seeing uh
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
students coming out with the ability to
 
00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
uh show that they're proficient in these
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
these competency areas this also lends
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
to a discussion about our academic
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
standards and what we have in our
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and what we have in and
 
00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on in schools sometimes
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
that Statewide assessment doesn't
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
parallel what's going on in the school
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily or the order in which that
 
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
course is offered one school district
 
00:32:10.109 --> 00:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
might offer a course in grade nine where
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
other might offer that in grade 10 or 11
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
but what happens if the test is given in
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
grade nine the ones taken grades 10 or
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
11 haven't had that course yet so the
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
scores are obviously going to be low
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
then the last conversation I want to
 
00:32:27.709 --> 00:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
have here is that there are districts
 
00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
app point to represent uh Heath District
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
of Manchester where there is a number of
 
00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
students which are coming in now that
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
are not proficient in
 
00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
English and we used to call it bilingual
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
education now it's English language
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
Learners and that is going to impact
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
where you are in the Statewide
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
assessment even though there's
 
00:32:50.709 --> 00:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
Alternative forms of that assessment can
 
00:32:53.189 --> 00:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
be given but it's going to impact they
 
00:32:55.229 --> 00:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
don't have the preceding information
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's been taught in those other grades
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
that they're being tested in so there
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
are a lot of issues on this and I think
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
the this issue is a very complex issue
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
and and this particular bill doesn't
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish what I think the ultimate
 
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.189 --> 00:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
leus I understand that
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
teachers try to do what they can to come
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
up with ways of teaching kids I also
 
00:33:26.229 --> 00:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
understand that they don't have the
 
00:33:30.109 --> 00:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
freedom to do that in a lot of cases
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
because the curriculum has been chosen
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what they have to teach by
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what they're told to teach by
 
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:39.560 align:start position:0%
even if that curriculum isn't working
 
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.030 align:start position:0%
even if that curriculum isn't working
and

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
so part of the point of this was to
 
00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
get um School boards
 
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.950 align:start position:0%
get um School boards
superintendents

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
superintendents
 
00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
to look at what the curriculum is that
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
they are pushing and
 
00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
they are pushing and
demanding

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
demanding
 
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
and perhaps give teachers more freedom
 
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
to think outside the box and come up
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
with something that works as opposed to
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
we will be teaching this even though
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
this doesn't work thank you
 
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative Damon then represent
 
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair I strongly
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
support the on this bill I think that if
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
this protocol were implemented it would
 
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
be taking money from the districts where
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is most
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
needed I think
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
it with appreciation of the sponsor's
 
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
intent to improve things I think it
 
00:34:39.189 --> 00:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
disrespects the capacity of our teachers
 
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
and what they are doing to teach
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
different students in different ways
 
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:45.880 align:start position:0%
that work for them it's not a grip Bill
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair I
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
just want to comment on what was what um
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lakers just said when
 
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum isn't working I don't think
 
00:34:57.189 --> 00:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
it's about curriculum I mean curriculum
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
is what we teach how we teach is a
 
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
totally different story right it's a
 
00:35:05.149 --> 00:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
hugely different so if you're teaching
 
00:35:06.229 --> 00:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
reading your
 
00:35:08.629 --> 00:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum is a reading curriculum but
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
how you or let's go to math how you
 
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
teach it your job is to make sure that
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
you teach the curriculum so I I think
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between the two
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent beler and represent whitcock
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just just to quickly
 
00:35:23.709 --> 00:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
comment I think the sponsors of this
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill have identified a very good and
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
important Target uh like any Target I
 
00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
think there's multiple ways to get at it
 
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
I think at this time this is not the
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
optimum angle of attack on this
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
particular um Target but I do look
 
00:35:41.229 --> 00:35:41.239 align:start position:0%
forward to supporting several other
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
angles that are going to be coming
 
00:35:46.229 --> 00:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
up represent
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
Woodcock chairman lad um just I want to
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
sort of refrain and
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
what represent Hall said as regards
 
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
comments from president leas uh the
 
00:35:59.669 --> 00:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum is established but the
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
pedagogy is not um and the teachers
 
00:36:06.189 --> 00:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
develop a toolbox of how to work with
 
00:36:08.669 --> 00:36:08.679 align:start position:0%
youngsters and that toolbox is what
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
allows teachers to be skilled and have
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
youngsters meet where they are and go
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
forward so I don't think it's a case of
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
being they aren't allowed to do what
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
they choose to do I think the teachers
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
are very efficient and taking their
 
00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
skills that they Master over years
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
obviously not the first two or three
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
after they Master over years and are
 
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
able to reach different levels of
 
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
youngsters so I just want to make the
 
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
clear I I don't see it as a teacher
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
inefficiency in this case thank you
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Celli
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just going back to the
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
conversation between representative
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
lakas and representative Hall um I I
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
think there is a curriculum aspect to
 
00:36:48.629 --> 00:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
this uh last year on my literacy um
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
initiative I worked with a special Leed
 
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.709 align:start position:0%
initiative I worked with a special Leed
reading

00:36:52.709 --> 00:36:52.719 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
specialist who was in a school where
 
00:37:00.229 --> 00:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
they taught by the now disproven method
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
of reading instruction all the reading
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
materials she fought to have that
 
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
changed for three years finally gave up
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
and left and went to a different school
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
where they used evidence-based um
 
00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
methods and instruction so um I think
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is an aspect to what
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative lakas was talking about
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative perel thank you Mr
 
00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:26.360 align:start position:0%
chair um I understand what
 
00:37:28.189 --> 00:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative leus is trying to do with
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
um probably education has been moving
 
00:37:37.229 --> 00:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
along in a similar pattern for a very
 
00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
long time and I just want to draw
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
attention to chapter 194e Innovation
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I think that if we want to
 
00:37:45.669 --> 00:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
make some changes we should probably be
 
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
encouraging schools to take a look at
 
00:37:50.669 --> 00:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
this chapter of Law and and local
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
districts could actually start to make
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
some Innovative changes on their
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
own further discussion representative
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair um I think
 
00:38:05.149 --> 00:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
there's another aspect of this that also
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be considered and it's the
 
00:38:10.669 --> 00:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
assessment process by which we determine
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that a student is not progressing so
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
forth a recent experience is with doing
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
teachers with training teachers who are
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
Paras and adults and take the courses
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
after the fact has established that they
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't do well on the practice test
 
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
unless they take the practice test after
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
they've had the course addressing that
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
subskill and then they do very
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
successfully but if you delay it for a
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
while it gets lost in all the other new
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
things they're doing and they don't
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
perform well on the test and yet if you
 
00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
do it in sequence one after another they

invariably pass so it's just one of
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
those kinds of of things like is the
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
assessment not timed correctly with when
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
they learn the material and it's it's a
 
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:06.109 align:start position:0%
they learn the material and it's it's a
real

00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
question if they don't remember it
 
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
because the test is given later they
 
00:39:13.709 --> 00:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
didn't know it but for me the thing that
 
00:39:17.149 --> 00:39:17.159 align:start position:0%
says we're not proficient is not a test
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's the fact that they get to college
 
00:39:20.709 --> 00:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
and can't do the B it don't have the
 
00:39:23.669 --> 00:39:23.679 align:start position:0%
basic skills the fact that colleges have
 
00:39:26.149 --> 00:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
to do remediation means that we are
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
graduating kids that don't have the
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
skills that they need and for me that's
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
the ultimate
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%

look that over so we're jumping over
 
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.270 align:start position:0%
look that over so we're jumping over
this

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
bill um and then we'll come back and
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%

yeah yeah I want to read the bill though
 
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's about mandatory elected public
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
school curricula and I Look to
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
representa Miler for a motion I move itl
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll second
 
00:41:37.229 --> 00:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
it represent Miley you're yeah this yeah
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is just way too prescriptive
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh it it is not it's not the
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this committee to
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
outline and a dictate what books should
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
be read
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
Etc and uh
 
00:41:54.189 --> 00:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh when I first heard this first heard
 
00:41:56.669 --> 00:41:56.679 align:start position:0%
of this bill and read the bill I just
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
shook my head because I it's just I
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever seen a bill uh
 
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
come before this committee that is that
 
00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
has this kind of dicta to it as far as
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
what should be taught what book should
 
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
be read and what sequence it should be
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
read it's just way too much so that's
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
chair and and I have no further
 
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
discussion on either so we will move on
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
to committee
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussion here further committee
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
leus I want to say that I very much like
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
the direction that this is going in I
 
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
think this these are things that
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
definitely need to
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
be um part of the
 
00:42:45.669 --> 00:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
curriculum but I have to agree
 
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
that this would be something that if I
 
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
was a school board member I might be
 
00:42:55.629 --> 00:42:55.639 align:start position:0%
pushing for but but from our place it is
 
00:42:58.830 --> 00:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit too
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
much telling local school districts
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what they need to do but somehow
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
I do agree this needs to be
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
done further

um having taught in college and having
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
students unable to Define what communism
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
even is so many students getting through
 
00:43:32.229 --> 00:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
12 years of school and and being unable
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
to to even recognize that and I have to
 
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
teach them this to them as if they've
 
00:43:39.709 --> 00:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
never heard anything about this before I
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
see the need for more education on um
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
this egregious political philosophy that
 
00:43:50.629 --> 00:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
destroys countries so I commend repres
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
pres Belcher for all of his work on
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
this however um I I think this would all
 
00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
the points that are in here would be a a
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful syllabus for a college level
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
course um I have to agree with with
 
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
others that it's just a bit too too
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
detailed um and not appropriate for um

useful course

it brought together a lot of things I

knew a little about a little about here
 
00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
and all that but it put it together in a

the kind of government exists in those
 
00:45:13.229 --> 00:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
kinds of countries and it was not

terribly complicated it could have been

a high school's scor maybe AP perhaps
 
00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless a high School course but
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
it certainly could be a college course
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%

everything that representative Miler

have heard some Fair

criticisms um for those who are opposed
 
00:45:58.189 --> 00:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
to this bill based on the over
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
prescriptive nature of it or the
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
particular content of it fair point and
 
00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
I totally understand that I would argue
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the other side however that when it
 
00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
comes to local
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%

that this body and this committee is

00:46:25.709 --> 00:46:25.719 align:start position:0%
it is coming from the United Nations and
 
00:46:27.709 --> 00:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
UNESCO it is coming from local school
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
boards as well it's coming from NOS who
 
00:46:32.149 --> 00:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
are providing free curriculum to schools
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
and of course that is very um beneficial
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
for schools to not have to pay for it so
 
00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:38.679 align:start position:0%
they will obviously quickly accept a lot
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
of free stuff that's coming
 
00:46:44.149 --> 00:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
in um and I believe our constituents
 
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
sent us here as their representatives to
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
reform schools and fix the problems that
 
00:46:50.709 --> 00:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
are existing in them this bill is one
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
step toward that process and again I
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
take I take the fair
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
criticism and if this goes down the way
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
I think it will I will not prevent
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
consent but I still support this Bill
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion representa
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
Tanner again I would say that we all
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
were not elected to reform education so
 
00:47:14.669 --> 00:47:14.679 align:start position:0%
please don't put on us what you feel
 
00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:17.840 align:start position:0%

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
heard from the sponsor of this that they
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
did not believe that
 
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
any T New Hampshire tax paay money
 
00:50:18.229 --> 00:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
should go towards the
 
00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
support of a charitable
 
00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
organization that is
 
00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and from that I could
 
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and from that I could
assume

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
that that individual does not want any
 
00:50:43.709 --> 00:50:43.719 align:start position:0%
money in the state of New Hampshire to
 
00:50:46.229 --> 00:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
go to Planned Parenthood because not
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
only are they not Incorporated in the
 
00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire point of order
 
00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
point of order Mr chair I I I got what's
 
00:50:55.669 --> 00:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
your point of order my point of order is
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
that is that um it's being implied upon
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
me that that I am believing of certain
 
00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
things that I clearly don't believe and
 
00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
I believe the person making those
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
implications has tried and failed to do
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
that in this Committee in the past and I
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
think that's an abhorent use of U of
 
00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
committee time and asserting um that are
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
that are clearly not true thank you
 
00:51:27.149 --> 00:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm sorry I implied that in
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
that case I would have to assume that
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
you did not mean what you said because
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood is not in repus yes
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know I do not want
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
anybody pointing language towards
 
00:51:43.709 --> 00:51:43.719 align:start position:0%
anybody on this committee or anybody
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
outside this committee okay period I'm
 
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
sorry I take that back I will point out
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
however that the state pays for lots of
 
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
things that are not Incorporated in New
 
00:51:59.189 --> 00:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that
 
00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
therefore if we are that we should not
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
00:52:06.629 --> 00:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
bill pointing at one particular
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
organization that is not Incorporated in
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire when there
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
are many corporations in the state of
 
00:52:17.229 --> 00:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which we do pay for thank
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
you further discussion on on the bill
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so so the um the the purpose of
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um as as I presented when I
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
introduced it is to provide um improved
 
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
transparency and Clarity on um on the
 
00:52:36.669 --> 00:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
expenses that are that are incurred by
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
the charitable Foundation that uh runs
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account program um
 
00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
last year we were not successful I think
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're very close at um although um to uh
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
to move the administration of the
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
program from a charity to the uh to the
 
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire through the
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education but I think
 
00:52:59.350 --> 00:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
absent that uh I don't think it's much
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
to ask that um that the um that the
 
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
charitable nonprofit uh in this case uh
 
00:53:10.189 --> 00:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
provide a a
 
00:53:14.189 --> 00:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
transparent uh disclosure uh of um of
 
00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
their of their uh of their revenues and
 
00:53:20.149 --> 00:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
their expenses as well as their assets
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
and liabilities and um and because the
 
00:53:28.229 --> 00:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
um the contract is not with a um is not
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
with the um the the U children's
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund of New Hampshire as as
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
as um as is often referred to it but is
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
instead with the children's scholarship
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
fund Incorporated which is based uh
 
00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
based out of New York and manages 22
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
other programs in 19 other states that
 
00:53:52.709 --> 00:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
um that that it is um it is impossible
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
to actually cull out the um uh the
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
revenues and the expenses that's one
 
00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
part so that's the profit and loss piece
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
as well as the assets and liabilities
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the um from the charitable the
 
00:54:08.149 --> 00:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
report of charitable operations that
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
every 501c3 in the country has to file
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis with the Internal
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue Service it's called the form 990
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
and um my most recent review of the form
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
9990 filed by the children's scholarship
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
fund shows absolutely zero revenues
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
coming from other governments so coming
 
00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
from government so so clearly the the
 
00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
dollars that go to the education Freedom
 
00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
account program do come from the state
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire they come from the
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
state's educational trust fund it is in
 
00:54:42.109 --> 00:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
the state budget these are government
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
dollars and the um the 990 reports zero
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
and uh you can also see from from
 
00:54:51.229 --> 00:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
looking at that that that the uh that
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
the numbers over the years of of uh
 
00:54:54.599 --> 00:54:55.709 align:start position:0%
the numbers over the years of of uh
charitable

00:54:55.709 --> 00:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
contributions that come from I I I don't
 
00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:03.320 align:start position:0%
know from where but um have um uh uh
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
have have not um changed they wiggle
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
around a little bit but it's 2223
 
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
million a year going back um going back
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
several years but they haven't changed
 
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
um despite over the last two years over
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
$25 million in government funds coming
 
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire uh with
 
00:55:25.669 --> 00:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
all but 10% of that used for um Ed for
 
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
funding educational Freedom accounts so
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't show at least in my review of
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
this those assets uh coming from the
 
00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and those
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
liabilities um um incurred through um
 
00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
through education Freedom accounts
 
00:55:40.599 --> 00:55:41.709 align:start position:0%
through education Freedom accounts
reported

00:55:41.709 --> 00:55:41.719 align:start position:0%
reported
 
00:55:45.669 --> 00:55:45.679 align:start position:0%
on what what what every
 
00:55:49.669 --> 00:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
501c3 um uh every charity needs to do
 
00:55:51.629 --> 00:55:51.639 align:start position:0%
and so from the standpoint of a public
 
00:55:54.189 --> 00:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
disclosure public accountability public
 
00:55:57.669 --> 00:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
transparency uh this is a way of uh of
 
00:56:00.229 --> 00:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
overcoming uh that making it much more
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
clear and and you know and honestly New
 
00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has is one of the states with
 
00:56:09.709 --> 00:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
the largest number of 501 c3s that
 
00:56:12.189 --> 00:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
operate in the state it um it it
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
certainly hasn't presented uh to be an
 
00:56:17.229 --> 00:56:17.239 align:start position:0%
obstacle with with other nonprofits
 
00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
incorporating is 503 5050 1 c3s uh in
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and um and I
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
think should we uh should we not be
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
moving in a direct well I think we
 
00:56:29.229 --> 00:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
should be moving in a direction of
 
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
having the uh the the New Hampshire's um
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education administer the
 
00:56:36.669 --> 00:56:36.679 align:start position:0%
program but fallowing short of that I
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
think we should have a New Hampshire
 
00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit administering the program at
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
least make the 990s clear thank you
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is our further
 
00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair just want to
 
00:56:51.709 --> 00:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that while we heard
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that suggested that this bill
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
would somehow interfere
 
00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
with students receiving their education
 
00:57:02.629 --> 00:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
Freedom account vouchers the bill does
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
not in any way change the implementation
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
of the voucher program it just increases
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
transparency in the funding of
 
00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
it represent cordelli uh thank you Mr
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um I would just like to point
 
00:57:20.189 --> 00:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
out that um
 
00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh that there is an audit done um and of
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
the uh scholarship organization that's
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
available on the website there's much
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
information available on the website uh
 
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
transparency um there is an oversight
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh that did do a report this
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
year um and actually there was a a
 
00:57:42.189 --> 00:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
Minority Report uh from uh chairman lad
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
and myself um to that report um so I I
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
think that there is
 
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
transparency um I I I would like to see
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh for instance um the uh or scholarship
 
00:57:59.229 --> 00:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
organization does do a a survey of
 
00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
parents uh for the tax credit
 
00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
scholarship program um which is the
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
subject of this um legislation I'd like
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
to see them do that um for the uh
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program also
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I've I've talked to uh the director
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
um about that um but I I think that
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
there is transparency
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
um and the money that they have saved
 
00:58:25.189 --> 00:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
from the allowable administrative cost
 
00:58:25.199 --> 00:58:26.790 align:start position:0%
from the allowable administrative cost
of

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
10% um does go to additional money for
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
for students and I believe uh the past
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
two years um that administrative uh uh
 
00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
amount has been less than uh
 
00:58:44.229 --> 00:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
8% thank you uh represent B has hand
 
00:58:46.229 --> 00:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
then we'll come this
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
side uh thank you Mr chair I I think
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's really two primary important
 
00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
points to hit on on this bill um number
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
one is as it as has previously been
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out the state uh does contract
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
with a number of other NOS um and
 
00:59:06.149 --> 00:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
organizations that are not Incorporated
 
00:59:07.629 --> 00:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
in the state but they are nonetheless
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
registered in in good standing to do
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
business in the state so the first thing
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
is the the specific way this bill is
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
written means it would only apply to one
 
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
corporate entity in this state and
 
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
because of that I believe this would
 
00:59:23.669 --> 00:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
meet the legal definition of
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
discrimination and open us up the
 
00:59:28.189 --> 00:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuits which we would likely lose the
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
second big thing to point out is the
 
00:59:32.550 --> 00:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
actual practical effect that this bill
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
would have if it were to go into effect
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
it would result in the immediate
 
00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
desertification of the only organization
 
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
currently authorized to run our
 
00:59:43.669 --> 00:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
scholarship and EFA
 
00:59:47.189 --> 00:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
program as a result the 2,300 New
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students who were depending on
 
00:59:51.669 --> 00:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
a dist dispersement from that
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
organization roughly in September of
 
00:59:56.709 --> 00:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
this year would not receive it because
 
00:59:58.709 --> 00:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
there would be no organization from
 
01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
which to receive it and they would be
 
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
forced out of their current educational
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances when this fact was brought
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
up to during our hearings we heard from
 
01:00:10.709 --> 01:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
some proponents of this bill that we
 
01:00:12.149 --> 01:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
might expect an amendment to be
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
forthcoming pushing the deadline to
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
allow the organization who is currently
 
01:00:19.229 --> 01:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
running it time to incorporate in New
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before this would be in effect
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
today uh further question representative
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh McDonald and then represent Pell
 
01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd just like to
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
address what was said a moment ago by
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative Damon because I would
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
agree this bill as written would not
 
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
change the implementation of the voucher
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
program because New Hampshire does not
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
have a voucher program as it's been said
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
in this committee what New Hampshire
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
does have is an education Freedom
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
account program which is distinctly
 
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
different I would however and I do
 
01:00:53.629 --> 01:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
generally support the concept of
 
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
vouchers but that's a
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization of the program thank
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
you representative pill Mr chairman
 
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
clarify I said education Freedom account
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
voucher that is still an inaccurate term
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
but thank you okay we all have gone
 
01:01:12.229 --> 01:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
through this great discussion before uh
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
you can believe what you want believe
 
01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
you can believe what you want to believe
 
01:01:16.709 --> 01:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative petel well representative
 
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
McDonald stole my comment
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Heath then
 
01:01:26.629 --> 01:01:26.639 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock thank you Mr chair I
 
01:01:29.629 --> 01:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
have was not here for the testimony but
 
01:01:32.669 --> 01:01:32.679 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge all the Secretary of
 
01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
State um all nonprofit corporations
 
01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
established under New Hampshire law must
 
01:01:42.629 --> 01:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
file a nonprofit report every 5 years um
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
failure to do so could result in um
 
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
dissolution I don't understand why I I
 
01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
am naive I guess in the fact that I
 
01:01:54.229 --> 01:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
always thought that the scholarship
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
organization was incorporated and had
 
01:01:59.350 --> 01:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
filed with the Secretary of State's
 
01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
office um I thought that was a
 
01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
requirement and is the Secretary State
 
01:02:08.709 --> 01:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
aware that this organization doesn't
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
file with them it is filed
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli I believe that
 
01:02:17.229 --> 01:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
they are filed but it's filed as a quote
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
unquote foreign non profit because it's
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
um out of state thank you now represent
 
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
Woodcock yes thank you ch um I I think I
 
01:02:32.189 --> 01:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
take a different perspective on this on
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
this program uh the uh young woman who
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
was here uh talking uh in testimony
 
01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
about the program uh indicated that
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
she'd been uh had exposure to multiple
 
01:02:47.229 --> 01:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
organizations including initial one as a
 
01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:49.639 align:start position:0%
501 C3 nonprofit and she's done the
 
01:02:51.669 --> 01:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
paperwork for that she knows how to do
 
01:02:55.149 --> 01:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
that uh and I I don't and I think when
 
01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
she was talking about the fact that when
 
01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
she first started she was out you know
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
trying to take out money for the the
 
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization which was
 
01:03:05.669 --> 01:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
terrific um but her annual pay was
 
01:03:07.669 --> 01:03:07.679 align:start position:0%
$20,000 because she only get the 10% of
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
the 200 she rise she was really working
 
01:03:11.189 --> 01:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
how to do that however when I asked her
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
what the salary account was now she said
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
over 1
 
01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
million and I asked her how many
 
01:03:18.189 --> 01:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
employees she had she said well we moved
 
01:03:20.189 --> 01:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
to eight
 
01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
so the salary account and and so I'm
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
thinking I want by happen stance I
 
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
happen to be on two or three different
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
foundations all of which are uh
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and they're all run by a
 
01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
board um so the beauty of that is the
 
01:03:37.149 --> 01:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
forms that uh this nonprofit requirement
 
01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
would nonprofit organization would
 
01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
require delineates through the Board of
 
01:03:44.350 --> 01:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
Trustees how money's are spent where
 
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
they spent um and that's it so I just
 
01:03:49.709 --> 01:03:49.719 align:start position:0%
see this as a very simp
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
accounting bill I don't see it as a
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
prejudicial bill um I think she's done a
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
heck of a job building that organization
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
but uh I just think it shows the public
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
here's where your money goes here's how
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
it's being used here's what you use for
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
salaries here's percentage we're taking
 
01:04:05.189 --> 01:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
and I don't see it as anything wouldn't
 
01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
that and I think it this this committee
 
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
often often ask for transparency in
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
every single thing we do and
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
accountability from from any anything we
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
do so this seems very simple to me this
 
01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
this allows because as a New Hampshire
 
01:04:21.229 --> 01:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit doesn't sh the paperwork it's
 
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
in there there we go I don't see any
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
more than that I just think I think
 
01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're making a mistake by allowing
 
01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
this to continue without providing any
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh data towards that information repres
 
01:04:36.149 --> 01:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you represent mil thank you Mr
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
chair you know this is a simple
 
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill it's a simple Bill file with the
 
01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
state you know every time we bring up
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
efas or tax credits everybody goes
 
01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
ballistic in trying to protect it we're
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with an organization potentially
 
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
not the tax credit but uh deal with the
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
EFA since it was mentioned you're
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
talking about 60 million dollars
 
01:05:11.189 --> 01:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
here this is not a simple little bill or
 
01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
program and every time we try to bring
 
01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
out some kind of a guard rail that
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
provides some direction some manage
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
within the state everybody goes
 
01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
crazy you know in during the
 
01:05:28.629 --> 01:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
testimony it was brought out that the
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
current program is an outlier
 
01:05:35.189 --> 01:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
now with the with the New York program
 
01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
that other state organizations are filed
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
locally with their
 
01:05:45.189 --> 01:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
state so I I I I wish that at some point
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
in time we can begin to say that this
 
01:05:50.069 --> 01:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
program has grown
 
01:05:52.669 --> 01:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
there are kids that are involved in this
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
program and all we're trying to we're
 
01:05:57.709 --> 01:05:57.719 align:start position:0%
not trying to repeal this we're just
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
trying to say how do we get a little
 
01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:02.679 align:start position:0%
more Focus for it for the state that's
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
why I I I don't understand why there's
 
01:06:07.189 --> 01:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
been so much angst about this it's the
 
01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:11.719 align:start position:0%
simple process of filing with the state
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
period thank you thank you is are there
 
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
is there any more discussion from the
 
01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
committee represent aler thank you I
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a quick
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarification when it comes to um filing
 
01:06:26.709 --> 01:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
with the state um this organization is
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
registered with the state they do file
 
01:06:29.669 --> 01:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
with the state according to the
 
01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State they are in good
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
standing but I believe their tax is
 
01:06:37.149 --> 01:06:37.159 align:start position:0%
maybe filed through their state where
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
they are Incorporated but they are
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
meeting all New Hampshire legal
 
01:06:43.229 --> 01:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
requirements okay I'd like to go right
 
01:06:46.189 --> 01:06:46.199 align:start position:0%

H

01:36:04.349 --> 01:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
H
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:13.269 --> 01:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
second second by represent Damon um Mr
 
01:36:15.309 --> 01:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
chairman let me walk through and and and
 
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
indicate what this amendment does the
 
01:36:20.269 --> 01:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
amendment keeps section one with no
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
changes as it was submitted to us as
 
01:36:25.309 --> 01:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
introduced section two which deals with
 
01:36:28.269 --> 01:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
excused absences what the amendment does
 
01:36:29.389 --> 01:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
is as New Hampshire Department of
 
01:36:31.710 --> 01:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
Education is directed to excuse student
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
absences from school on April 8
 
01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
2024 if a student travels to view the
 
01:36:40.389 --> 01:36:40.399 align:start position:0%
total total solar eclipse so it's a one-
 
01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
day not a two-day
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
excuse and it also goes on to say
 
01:36:49.269 --> 01:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
schools are encouraged to embed total
 
01:36:51.469 --> 01:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
total solar eclipse activities into
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum and instruction consistent
 
01:36:58.469 --> 01:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
with section three of this act so just
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get some planning in terms of
 
01:37:04.710 --> 01:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
what a solar eclipse is embed it into in
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
some instruction help kids know some of
 
01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
the other portions of that bill which is
 
01:37:12.150 --> 01:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
section three here safety viewing a
 
01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
total solar eclipse and the the
 
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
the the bill has introduced didn't
 
01:37:21.349 --> 01:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
address this and after the committee's
 
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
done research we found this the words
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
that you see there are verbatim from
 
01:37:31.429 --> 01:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
NASA and supported by optometrist you
 
01:37:33.469 --> 01:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
don't want to look at a solar eclipse
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
prior to during and after without proper
 
01:37:39.269 --> 01:37:39.279 align:start position:0%
equipment over those eyes or all the
 
01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
items that's mentioned here in this bill
 
01:37:45.150 --> 01:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to be uh communicating
 
01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
with kids and school and to people in
 
01:37:50.389 --> 01:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
school staff that tell the kids to
 
01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
observe before and after and during and
 
01:37:55.630 --> 01:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
after but not telling them any of the
 
01:37:58.150 --> 01:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
safety that should be associated with it
 
01:38:00.309 --> 01:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing this B Amendment does it
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
takes out the rulle making process the
 
01:38:05.429 --> 01:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced had a Ru making
 
01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
process in in fact if we left the ru
 
01:38:09.269 --> 01:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
making process by the time the rule
 
01:38:11.469 --> 01:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
making would be done it probably about
 
01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
about a year after the solar eclipse and
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
so it just doesn't work that way so
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's been struck from the bill so
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's the amendment and this uh
 
01:38:25.190 --> 01:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh takes effect immediately upon passage
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
and also I might
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
add that this committee has discussed
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
this as a total and it's probably
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate that this committee submit a
 
01:38:37.469 --> 01:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
letter to the Department of Education
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
and Advising them without the the
 
01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
eclipse coming and perhaps it would be
 
01:38:42.910 --> 01:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
best that some kind of communication be
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
made with schools regarding the safety
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
for children
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
um in their watching this or are
 
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
discussed in class uh we want that done
 
01:38:54.389 --> 01:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
prior to this eclipse curring the bill
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
could possibly end up being passed after
 
01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
the eclipse if you know things happen
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
the way they normally happen around this
 
01:39:05.269 --> 01:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
House and Senate so um so that's that's
 
01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to the D Amendment only
 
01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.750 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking to the D Amendment only
right

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
now oh R luno yeah thank you very much
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and um and you know I think
 
01:39:18.469 --> 01:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
this amendment does make a lot of does
 
01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
make substantive changes to the um to
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
the original bill but but just directing
 
01:39:26.309 --> 01:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
a question at um at section three I'm no
 
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
expert but um but uh where you know I
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
guess how was the the the safety
 
01:39:37.349 --> 01:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
language um in section three
 
01:39:39.150 --> 01:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
developed it
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
was I have it right here section three
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah that's the safety stuff
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it came directly from NASA I I
 
01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
thought I had handed that out at the
 
01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
previous previous meeting I think
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
everybody has a copy there as a cop I
 
01:39:56.469 --> 01:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
can't put my hands on okay fantastic
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's all NASA okay
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
fantastic great thank you you're welcome
 
01:40:04.429 --> 01:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
rep represent Woodcock thank you
 
01:40:07.469 --> 01:40:07.479 align:start position:0%
chairman I I I uh support the concept I
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
just have two questions on the amendment
 
01:40:11.190 --> 01:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
and and the first is um how are you
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
going to verify that the student travels
 
01:40:15.790 --> 01:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
and the second one is how far how far is
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
going to make a travel for a youngster
 
01:40:20.349 --> 01:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
to leave school if I go from Berlin over
 
01:40:23.110 --> 01:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
to arrol can get out for the day I got a
 
01:40:25.309 --> 01:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
better location to look at it I go from
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
Conway to the the soccer fields down in
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
molon borrow I get out of school for a
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
day and it's the 3:00 event so and I
 
01:40:34.469 --> 01:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
know there just picky little things I
 
01:40:36.349 --> 01:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
just uh the solar clipse I I think is
 
01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
terrific um in terms of in terms of our
 
01:40:43.349 --> 01:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
doe uh making sure if you recall they
 
01:40:44.389 --> 01:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
said the commissioner is going to pass
 
01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
out the6 6,000 uh blue blue glasses as
 
01:40:50.349 --> 01:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
we saw it'd be terrific in integrating
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
into the education during the science
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum is terrific I do ask some
 
01:40:55.469 --> 01:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
questions about how you going to verify
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
particular how far how far you
 
01:40:59.710 --> 01:40:59.720 align:start position:0%
travel I I would say that's a local
 
01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
school responsibility to figure out how
 
01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to verify well do is
 
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
saying it's okay you're down you're out
 
01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:08.830 align:start position:0%
saying it's okay you're down you're out
I'm

01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
just yeah the department yeah the is
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
directed to excuse the student yeah so
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
there there and it does say about how
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
far yeah well see this what what we're
 
01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
doing right here with this is this is
 
01:41:22.510 --> 01:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
language which came from the sponsor
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
initially all we did is chop down okay
 
01:41:29.469 --> 01:41:29.479 align:start position:0%
two days my question thank you reent H
 
01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um in section to the excused
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
absence I'm just wondering is there an
 
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
assumption that if teachers want to take
 
01:41:37.349 --> 01:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
the time off that they're going to have
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
to go through their bargaining whatever
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
you know whether they have to take a
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
personal day I know like our school
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
district has a I believe used to anyway
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
had a limit of seven teachers on any
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
given day beyond that they weren't
 
01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
required to um would be an assump that
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
would be an assumption because the bill
 
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to that it speaks to a
 
01:41:56.910 --> 01:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
student okay doesn't speak to the
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
faculty okay so I am concerned about
 
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
that that the kids can go but the
 
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:01.710 align:start position:0%
that that the kids can go but the
teachers

01:42:01.710 --> 01:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
can't repr
 
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
tner thank you and and I guess I just go
 
01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
back to my initial comment when we were
 
01:42:11.309 --> 01:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
talking about it during the committee
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and it's why why should we go
 
01:42:18.110 --> 01:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
through the bill procedure all the paper
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
everything that that is concerned with
 
01:42:23.469 --> 01:42:23.479 align:start position:0%
with bills when this can just be a
 
01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
memorandum to the Department of
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
Education um I you know why does the
 
01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education have to direct
 
01:42:35.230 --> 01:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
to excuse student absences when that's
 
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's a local issue um and you know
 
01:42:40.190 --> 01:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
that could be in the memorandum that
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
they strongly suggest that that the
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
absences are excused but
 
01:42:48.269 --> 01:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine the school would not
 
01:42:50.469 --> 01:42:50.479 align:start position:0%
excuse those absences I mean they they
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
excuse absences for leaving early to go
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
to you know to to Disney World so um I I
 
01:43:01.309 --> 01:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
just think we have so many bills I mean
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
look at this book and look at the book
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
that we had before that was twice the
 
01:43:07.429 --> 01:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
size and it's like why are we why are we
 
01:43:09.309 --> 01:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
making another regulation or another
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill or another law U for something that
 
01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:15.399 align:start position:0%
really isn't needed that that's just my
 
01:43:15.399 --> 01:43:16.910 align:start position:0%
really isn't needed that that's just my
representative

01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you um I agree in the
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
sense that I don't think we should be
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
making a law to amend a school
 
01:43:29.190 --> 01:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
calendar I think it's a wonderful
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity for students and
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that when if schools
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
are in session they're going to use that
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
day for some education not all schools
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
are open several including the Upper
 
01:43:45.269 --> 01:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
Valley hover Lebanon masoma they're all
 
01:43:47.710 --> 01:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
closed for spring break maybe
 
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
intentionally um schools in the North
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
country are all closed I've already seen
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
on sa 84 website a whole public link on
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
the solar eclipse and different
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities for education but what
 
01:44:06.190 --> 01:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
really makes me say it doesn't belong
 
01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
here is the process of setting a School
 
01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.510 align:start position:0%
here is the process of setting a School
District

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
District
 
01:44:13.389 --> 01:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
calendar though it is individual by
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
districts districts use use a
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
recommended suggestion calendar that is
 
01:44:21.710 --> 01:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
first put out by the department of Ed
 
01:44:24.110 --> 01:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
and then the districts review it and
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
then they amend it based on what they
 
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
you know their days are the what
 
01:44:31.309 --> 01:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
required days there are for from their
 
01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
agreement and when neighboring schools
 
01:44:38.670 --> 01:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
are taking spring breaks winter breaks
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
days off versus not days
 
01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
off and so I looked at that calendar
 
01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
that was issued to the districts last
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
spring and April 8th was not a
 
01:44:51.630 --> 01:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
recommended day to
 
01:44:56.429 --> 01:44:56.439 align:start position:0%
close was it an afterthought maybe um
 
01:44:59.309 --> 01:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
but everybody has already passed their
 
01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
calendars and I think if they want to do
 
01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
something locally they have that
 
01:45:05.590 --> 01:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
Authority I believe with their school
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
board and then you just have to let the
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
state know whether you've amended your
 
01:45:13.190 --> 01:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
calendar but they're not telling you
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're deciding locally so because that
 
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
suggested calendar came out and it
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
didn't recommend by the doe to take
 
01:45:23.389 --> 01:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
April 8th as a closed day I don't see
 
01:45:25.110 --> 01:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
why we're backtracking and now telling
 
01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
them that it should be a law and I mean
 
01:45:30.389 --> 01:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
if this ends up passing the minimum they
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
ought to do is at least Supply every
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
district and student with
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
classes further further questions uh
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
could I just ask representative cascad
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
um if they closed that took that day
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
that wasn't originally on their calendar
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
they have to make it up somewhere
 
01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
else it depends on what their total
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
instructional hours are because now you
 
01:46:02.429 --> 01:46:02.439 align:start position:0%
need to be in school 180 days but if the
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
number of hours of instructional time
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
that you have built into your full
 
01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
year um you may not have to make it up I
 
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
mean it's like a snow day you know if
 
01:46:16.389 --> 01:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
you're is a little longer and you've
 
01:46:18.309 --> 01:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
added 15 minutes to your instructional
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
time in your school
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
calendar um then you can look at either
 
01:46:27.190 --> 01:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
one so every District's different yep
 
01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.230 align:start position:0%
one so every District's different yep

01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
01:46:33.190 --> 01:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that the amendment
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
is what's on the table and the amendment
 
01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
does not talk about closing school and I
 
01:46:40.630 --> 01:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
think the amendment does make it a
 
01:46:43.070 --> 01:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
better Bill also because it removes the
 
01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:54.389 align:start position:0%

01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
leus he said put your glasses on so I
 
01:47:01.309 --> 01:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
put my glasses on
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to comment on the yes it
 
01:47:07.710 --> 01:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't close it doesn't mandate closing
 
01:47:10.630 --> 01:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
schools but there are schools who have
 
01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:12.030 align:start position:0%
schools but there are schools who have
very

01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.910 align:start position:0%
very
narrow

01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
narrow
um

01:47:15.670 --> 01:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
excused absent policies and they give
 
01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.550 align:start position:0%
excused absent policies and they give
nonacademic

01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
nonacademic
 
01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
failures for things that we would think
 
01:47:28.630 --> 01:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
should be excused like certainly going
 
01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
to Disney World early would not be
 
01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
excused in these schools and so by
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
having us say yes you will excuse this
 
01:47:41.230 --> 01:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
one allows kids particularly from my
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
part of the state to be able to go up
 
01:47:45.389 --> 01:47:45.399 align:start position:0%
and see this thing that's going to
 
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.349 --> 01:47:50.359 align:start position:0%

Pell and to not to belabor that point in

particular but I think it also my point
 
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
will tie in with what representative

Woodcock said how do you know the
 
01:48:05.309 --> 01:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
student will travel that day or how do
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
you verify that they traveled but this
 
01:48:12.110 --> 01:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
would give parents the opportunity to uh
 
01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
be honest about what they're doing that
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
day instead of to say my kid has a
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
headache represent Bon thank you Mr
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
chair um I was just going to add I agree
 
01:48:25.269 --> 01:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
with what um representative Tanner said
 
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh issuing a memorandum from
 
01:48:29.910 --> 01:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and to the
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
other question that you had about the
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
required number of days I believe um a a
 
01:48:39.110 --> 01:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
school district can apply for a waiver
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
for a specific purpose and it has come
 
01:48:43.349 --> 01:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
up before when we had excessive snow
 
01:48:47.309 --> 01:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
days and the and the State can provide a
 
01:48:49.469 --> 01:48:49.479 align:start position:0%
waiver yeah I can
 
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
remember as a kid when King George
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
died and I was a school kid in Canada at
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
the time the doors were locked and and
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
there was no notice it it was a day off
 
01:49:04.990 --> 01:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
and kids got credit for school I can
 
01:49:06.670 --> 01:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
also remember when the Twin Towers went
 
01:49:09.269 --> 01:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
down in the state I was in and we had
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
students all over the state and the only
 
01:49:13.630 --> 01:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
way we could get them back was by
 
01:49:17.269 --> 01:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
playing but all planes were grounded and
 
01:49:19.349 --> 01:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
so the day was called off by the
 
01:49:21.269 --> 01:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent in the keenai peninsula
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
no school you know the next day until we
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
could figure out where all our kids were
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
so there are there are processes for
 
01:49:31.150 --> 01:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
waivers that can be given by the
 
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
department the commissioner can make
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
those decisions so um this amendment was
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
put forth in in support of that bill I'm
 
01:49:43.110 --> 01:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
not NE I'm not an author of that bill
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I have no ownership on that bill
 
01:49:47.590 --> 01:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill and I do support what represent
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner is also saying that I believe a
 
01:49:52.389 --> 01:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
letter directed from the committee here
 
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
trying to emphasize some of the points
 
01:49:56.269 --> 01:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
in it and let the department send that
 
01:49:58.469 --> 01:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
technical Bolton out to the districts
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
the way they normally do on so many
 
01:50:02.309 --> 01:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
issues I think that's another good tact
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
we we got to do
 
01:50:07.670 --> 01:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
something represent Tanner so as a
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
question chairman lad what would what
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
would I or anybody do to change to with
 
01:50:17.070 --> 01:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
we make an amendment to to this bill
 
01:50:20.389 --> 01:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
that it is a a memorandum that it would
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
be uh how how would we go about or do we
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
have to or can we just the way it's been
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
done in the past is that I always
 
01:50:31.150 --> 01:50:31.160 align:start position:0%
reflect back in what we did with
 
01:50:32.429 --> 01:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
representative guile and I've done it
 
01:50:35.469 --> 01:50:35.479 align:start position:0%
before too you vote the bill down but
 
01:50:39.389 --> 01:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
then you also as a committee take action
 
01:50:41.790 --> 01:50:41.800 align:start position:0%
to say we'd like to have this letter
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
written on our behalf to the Department
 
01:50:47.389 --> 01:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
and we usually got unanimous consent on
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
that everybody you know we got a show
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
and you so the chairman wrote that
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
letter shared it with all the committee
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
members and the communication was made
 
01:50:59.830 --> 01:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner and time for us to
 
01:51:03.110 --> 01:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
communicate to them on this whole
 
01:51:05.150 --> 01:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
situation the way it was introduced to
 
01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
us I was concerned about the liability
 
01:51:08.630 --> 01:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
the school districts were putting
 
01:51:10.150 --> 01:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
themselves into and the department was
 
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
putting themselves into by saying to the
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
kids go out and look at it before during
 
01:51:17.630 --> 01:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
and after and so it comes back and say
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
well I lost my my retina or whatever I'm
 
01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
not because of you know your directed to
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
go out and look at it uh so I I think
 
01:51:28.670 --> 01:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
that was there's an issue here and I'm
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
kind betwix and between how to do
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
this we can send rep leas to all the
 
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
schools with with those classes I
 
01:51:38.630 --> 01:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
thought they were passing them out to
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
every single kid that's she get mileage
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
you get yeah okay I I don't know if they
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
had an ample glasses for that I thought
 
01:51:51.469 --> 01:51:51.479 align:start position:0%
it was like onethird of what was needed
 
01:51:53.309 --> 01:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
but representative p no no I was just
 
01:51:55.190 --> 01:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to speak to that be because that
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
was off mic but um I believe the bill
 
01:52:01.309 --> 01:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor said that a significant amount
 
01:52:03.150 --> 01:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
of glasses were going to be distributed
 
01:52:06.269 --> 01:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
to the schools in the state from the do
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it was yeah it was a I thought
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
there was a quantity that was matched to
 
01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
was it 50 or 60,000
 
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
she said
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
160 160 so every 160,000 but one of the
 
01:52:23.150 --> 01:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
following testimony people say very high
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
to access uh the availability of them so
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay further discussion on this
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
Bill yes excuse me on the on the
 
01:52:34.469 --> 01:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
amendment sorry yeah I'm just I'm rather
 
01:52:37.190 --> 01:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
confused I think we all agree on what
 
01:52:40.269 --> 01:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be done I think I I'll speak
 
01:52:42.349 --> 01:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
for myself I guess
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
I you know kids should be seeing the
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
eclipse if at all possible teachers
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
should be seeing it uh you know you
 
01:52:53.349 --> 01:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
should not have two school days for it
 
01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
no I don't think you need this at all I
 
01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
mean I think a memo from the state
 
01:52:59.070 --> 01:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
department from the Department of Ed so
 
01:53:01.429 --> 01:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is so how do we do
 
01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
that who knows the answer to that
 
01:53:06.990 --> 01:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
without doing this represent wock just
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
vote it down and is it possible um for
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
this to be set on your executive
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
schedule table and have director here to
 
01:53:17.389 --> 01:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
write a letter on behalf of the
 
01:53:20.349 --> 01:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
committee what was the first part table
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
this in the schedule until another well
 
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
we we just we wouldn't take action on it
 
01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
right now I'll take
 
01:53:29.070 --> 01:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
action you write a letter on behalf of
 
01:53:31.269 --> 01:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
the committee in the interim it is a
 
01:53:33.190 --> 01:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill that's not an early
 
01:53:36.429 --> 01:53:36.439 align:start position:0%
bill there's apparently no fiscal note
 
01:53:36.439 --> 01:53:37.190 align:start position:0%
bill there's apparently no fiscal note
to

01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
it so we'd have to take action on this
 
01:53:43.349 --> 01:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
by the middle of March up or
 
01:53:43.359 --> 01:53:46.150 align:start position:0%
by the middle of March up or
down

01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:53:49.630 --> 01:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
well if postponing it if you postpone
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
this to March the eclipse is in what
 
01:53:55.269 --> 01:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
April and if you what I think if you're
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
going to do anything for with the
 
01:53:58.870 --> 01:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
Department it ought be done
 
01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
now the gear up for this and and who
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
knows they may be already I don't know
 
01:54:09.830 --> 01:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh but yes rer I think one of the things
 
01:54:15.469 --> 01:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
that we could do um is um is vote this
 
01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
down and then direct the chair on the
 
01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
record to send that letter of request to
 
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
the department uh for a technical
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
advisory to send out to the schools I
 
01:54:29.469 --> 01:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
mean that that would be one of the
 
01:54:32.710 --> 01:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
procedures that we could do correct
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's a procedure yes thank you there's
 
01:54:36.469 --> 01:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
another procedure too that the maker of
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
motion I'm not not no you made you made
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
the motion represent Pell for OTP I made
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
the motion for Amendment so what I will
 
01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
do is I don't know who second the
 
01:55:00.309 --> 01:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
amendment so I will pull that you two so
 
01:55:02.469 --> 01:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
we don't have that Amendment on the on
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
the table right now as a motion so it's
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
just sitting there in your packet so now
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're back to the original motion of
 
01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
OTP but the bunch of us like
 
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
the oh yeah if we're going to have the
 
01:55:17.190 --> 01:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill I I like that too but you know I
 
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
think we're headed towards another way
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
of dealing with
 
01:55:27.389 --> 01:55:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.469 --> 01:55:30.479 align:start position:0%
Administration you st let's do it let's
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
do a straw pool which is not taking
 
01:55:34.670 --> 01:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
action on it so how many people right

withdraw the motion we had subsequent
 
01:59:04.190 --> 01:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
motions on on that uh no I think we're
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the point where we're going to vote
 
01:59:08.269 --> 01:59:08.279 align:start position:0%
up or down yeah right yeah we're we're
 
01:59:10.389 --> 01:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
going to we got a motion on the table
 
01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
OTP that's where we have to pick it up
 
01:59:17.070 --> 01:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh so against just vote against it if
 
01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
you're just because you put a motion for
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean you have to vote on
 
01:59:24.349 --> 01:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
it can we speak to
 
01:59:27.469 --> 01:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
exactly why because of the safety
 
01:59:29.309 --> 01:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
concerns that are not addressed in the
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
original bill so I just want to make
 
01:59:34.309 --> 01:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
sure that that's apparent before I vote
 
01:59:35.630 --> 01:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
against my own motion we're gonna have
 
01:59:37.190 --> 01:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
further we're gonna have we're gonna
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
have further committee discussion on the
 
01:59:42.150 --> 01:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill right now because you've already
 
01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:42.830 align:start position:0%
bill right now because you've already
you

01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
know you've already had your opportunity
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
to speak on OTP prior to the amendment
 
01:59:49.670 --> 01:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
being offered so that's done so you
 
01:59:51.269 --> 01:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about that so now
 
01:59:54.510 --> 01:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
where we are as we're on this motion
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
OTP it's open to discussion amongst the
 
02:00:01.190 --> 02:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee anybody want to speak to
 
02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
it the bill itself represent pel thank
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
you I originally moved a to pass because
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
I was in favor of the amendment but the
 
02:00:12.590 --> 02:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill as written um doesn't take some
 
02:00:14.469 --> 02:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
significant safety concerns into
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
consideration so I will actually be
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
voting against a to pass on the original
 
02:00:23.190 --> 02:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
Bill further discussion refer beler
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I and I totally
 
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
respect that view and the opinion of rep
 
02:00:29.950 --> 02:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
petal I would note however that there
 
02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
already existing um safety guidelines
 
02:00:34.349 --> 02:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
that are being published by the federal
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
government we have been told that
 
02:00:38.229 --> 02:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
sunglasses will be handed out um in
 
02:00:40.469 --> 02:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
schools and they will receive um
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
instructions on them and I also believe
 
02:00:44.429 --> 02:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
in the in the private Marketplace that
 
02:00:46.670 --> 02:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be ample education from
 
02:00:48.469 --> 02:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
news media and other sources on the on
 
02:00:50.670 --> 02:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
the risk so I I would say that that is
 
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
not um not a big concern for me
 
02:00:55.389 --> 02:00:55.399 align:start position:0%
personally thank you representer
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
cascaden just want to reiterate again
 
02:01:00.389 --> 02:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
that the department of Ed did not
 
02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
suggest April 8th as a day to be
 
02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
closed and I'd like to interject one
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
thing now we're voting on a bill that
 
02:01:11.429 --> 02:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
has rule making in it the ru making is
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
going to kill this thing anyways because
 
02:01:15.630 --> 02:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
not going to not going to occur before
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
the eclipse so that's what you're voting
 
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
on represent
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
Cordell thank you Mr chair um so um I
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
got the eclipse guys coming to my
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
library for a presentation now they're
 
02:01:31.229 --> 02:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
they were great and I'm going to have to
 
02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
explain to them why I voted against
 
02:01:35.590 --> 02:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
their bill so I just want to go on the
 
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
record with um that this doesn't in any
 
02:01:41.590 --> 02:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
way take away from how important I think
 
02:01:44.349 --> 02:01:44.359 align:start position:0%
this is but I'm also believer in the
 
02:01:46.590 --> 02:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we have way too many laws and
 
02:01:48.150 --> 02:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
I know this one's just going to
 
02:01:53.429 --> 02:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
go out it won't you know last it's um
 
02:01:56.309 --> 02:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
but uh considering that and that I feel
 
02:01:58.469 --> 02:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
like the discussion here there there's
 
02:02:00.630 --> 02:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
another way of doing this of making this
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
happen of allowing the students to see
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
this and not be um considered absent
 
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
that I I would
 
02:02:14.269 --> 02:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh vote against OTP myself further
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
discussion represent Damon thank you Mr
 
02:02:18.670 --> 02:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to note in case other
 
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
folks have not seen this that the
 
02:02:22.190 --> 02:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill just sent us a
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
message um in which she says she's
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
watching us and it was mentioned to
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
Simply quote encourage the commissioner
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
to do this administratively she reminds
 
02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
us that's exactly what she did she
 
02:02:36.429 --> 02:02:36.439 align:start position:0%
originally approached the commissioner
 
02:02:38.389 --> 02:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
on this matter and he insisted that he
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
needed legislation to accomplish this
 
02:02:42.309 --> 02:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
and then she notes this bill is
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
introduced as virtually word for word
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
the same as what he tasked the job to be
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
I just paraphrase
 
02:02:53.229 --> 02:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
slightly that that said I uh will be
 
02:02:55.309 --> 02:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
voting against the
 
02:02:57.590 --> 02:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
OTP further
 
02:03:00.590 --> 02:03:00.600 align:start position:0%

02:03:11.349 --> 02:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
purpose to the
 
02:03:14.349 --> 02:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
bill yes
 
02:03:16.469 --> 02:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
so the schools can legally say this is
 
02:03:18.670 --> 02:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
legal to do and they don't have to argue
 
02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:19.510 align:start position:0%
legal to do and they don't have to argue
that

02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:21.550 --> 02:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
question I would argue from the
 
02:03:23.150 --> 02:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
perspective that if the Red Sox were
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
playing in penway park in the last game
 
02:03:26.389 --> 02:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
of the World Series how many kids would
 
02:03:27.389 --> 02:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
be down
 
02:03:29.710 --> 02:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
there and would they get an excused
 
02:03:33.469 --> 02:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
absent socks than well so what that's
 
02:03:33.479 --> 02:03:34.550 align:start position:0%
absent socks than well so what that's
represent

02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you I I think all the
 
02:03:40.110 --> 02:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
objections that that people have raised
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
certainly can be incorporated into that
 
02:03:45.229 --> 02:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh memo to the Department of Education
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
to suggest that it's an excused absence
 
02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
to have the safety issues in there I I
 
02:03:54.150 --> 02:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
just again think we can achieve what I
 
02:03:56.389 --> 02:03:56.399 align:start position:0%
think everybody here wants to achieve is
 
02:03:59.269 --> 02:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
to make the solar eclipse an important
 
02:04:02.670 --> 02:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
event a very important event to make
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
sure that it's done in a safe Manner and
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
that kids get the opportunity to um if
 
02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
their parents take them someplace to get
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
an excused absence
 
02:04:15.239 --> 02:04:16.670 align:start position:0%
an excused absence
representative

02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:19.110 --> 02:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh no I'll go representative McDonald
 
02:04:21.469 --> 02:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
first all right thank you um just a
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
question for the chair the letter that
 
02:04:24.910 --> 02:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
we've discussed and seemed to be in
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
agreement on is that still possible at
 
02:04:30.110 --> 02:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
this moment sure okay yep that would be
 
02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
a result of what type of action we take
 
02:04:34.910 --> 02:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
here today and that's the way we have
 
02:04:38.269 --> 02:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
done it before on certain issues where
 
02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
there's been communication on behalf of
 
02:04:42.710 --> 02:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
this whole committee sent to the
 
02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
this whole committee sent to the
Department

02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:04:45.710 --> 02:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
then with respect could I ask you to
 
02:04:48.429 --> 02:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
call the question on the vote if we're
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
all decided how we're going to vote
 
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
anyway is there anybody opposed to that
 
02:04:57.150 --> 02:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
perspective because we' never closed
 
02:04:59.550 --> 02:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
down discussion in committees like that
 
02:05:01.630 --> 02:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
we'll have one quick comment here is it
 
02:05:05.190 --> 02:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
okay yes sorry about that that's okay
 
02:05:08.190 --> 02:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
just wanted to check um just I I think
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner was saying that um
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
legislation was needed it is
 
02:05:16.630 --> 02:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
due to what's in line six and seven in
 
02:05:19.349 --> 02:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
that it directs the department to wave
 
02:05:22.630 --> 02:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
compulsory School attendance I think if
 
02:05:24.309 --> 02:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's in there that's why the
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.389 --> 02:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
needed but the commissioner also told me
 
02:05:36.389 --> 02:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
that um he did not know um about April
 
02:05:39.190 --> 02:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
9th being included in the
 
02:05:42.269 --> 02:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
legislation you warmed up representative
 
02:05:45.389 --> 02:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
cascaden just want to reiterate that the
 
02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
department of Ed issues a recommended
 
02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
calendar they did not recommend Monday
 
02:05:53.790 --> 02:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
April 8th as a closed day okay who's in
 
02:05:55.309 --> 02:05:55.319 align:start position:0%

02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure
 
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
fund and it's where we it
 
02:11:11.349 --> 02:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
reads this is the part that's deleted it
 
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
reads the first meeting of the
 
02:11:15.429 --> 02:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
commission shall be called by the first
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
named House member that's typical
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
language in setting up any commission
 
02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's called by the first uh
 
02:11:27.590 --> 02:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative if it's a house bill and
 
02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
then the commission elects a chairman at
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
that orientation meeting or the first
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
meeting the deleted areic goes on the
 
02:11:37.229 --> 02:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
first meeting of the commission shall be
 
02:11:39.389 --> 02:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
held within 45 days of the effective
 
02:11:42.150 --> 02:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
date of this section the commission
 
02:11:44.910 --> 02:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
shall meet at least monthly I understand
 
02:11:46.469 --> 02:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
that that the latter part meeting
 
02:11:49.269 --> 02:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
monthly we we we get that we know that
 
02:11:52.389 --> 02:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
that's upon the need but the question we
 
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
have is that what happens if in terms of
 
02:11:57.710 --> 02:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure
 
02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
commission I have been that chair of
 
02:12:03.190 --> 02:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
that commission ever since its
 
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
beginning what happens if I leave for
 
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:07.790 align:start position:0%
beginning what happens if I leave for
some

02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:12:11.190 --> 02:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
reason it could be anybody then who
 
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
calls the next
 
02:12:16.670 --> 02:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
meeting uh representative lad that's a
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
good question I don't know if I could
 
02:12:19.389 --> 02:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
get a copy of the amendment that would
 
02:12:21.389 --> 02:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
be great but um in general I know the
 
02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
law that law fairly well so I think I
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
know what you're talking about I would
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
have to take a read it over and and
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.469 --> 02:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
happen are there any question we're
 
02:12:37.190 --> 02:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
talking about this particular area right
 
02:12:39.630 --> 02:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
here the other areas where we Chang the
 
02:12:43.150 --> 02:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
definition of the the project manager
 
02:12:44.469 --> 02:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
we we understand where you're coming
 
02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
from there it's owner's project manager
 
02:12:49.190 --> 02:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're good with that at least I am I
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
think that every everybody's good with
 
02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
that we're just concerned about this one
 
02:12:56.670 --> 02:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
small area which is really not really a
 
02:13:00.150 --> 02:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
a huge impact
 
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
but it's more of a
 
02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:07.690 align:start position:0%
but it's more of a
procedural

02:13:07.690 --> 02:13:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:11.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.309 --> 02:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
issue or whether it should be the first
 
02:13:17.550 --> 02:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
part of that part that's deleted should
 
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
not be deleted in the last sentence
 
02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be deleted where requiring of
 
02:13:26.070 --> 02:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
the monthly meeting I'm reading this
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
here real quickly that that makes sense
 
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
I think the concern from the commission
 
02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
was simply that they were required to
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
meet monthly and at certain periods of
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the year there's not no action for them
 
02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
to do so the focus really was uh
 
02:13:40.070 --> 02:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
removing that sentence that you
 
02:13:42.590 --> 02:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I believe the a prior
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
sentence which is uh the prior two
 
02:13:46.429 --> 02:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
sentences that you're referring to I
 
02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
think the intent was just that that was
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh past language it wasn't needed I
 
02:13:53.229 --> 02:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any if you wanted to
 
02:13:54.710 --> 02:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
keep it that's fine I don't think there
 
02:13:56.309 --> 02:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
was any purpose for deleting it other
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
than cleaning it up so that makes sense
 
02:14:04.269 --> 02:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so in in hearing that and of course
 
02:14:05.469 --> 02:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
represent Heath you're on that
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
commission as well and I think the
 
02:14:11.389 --> 02:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
commission's been together so long we
 
02:14:14.630 --> 02:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
think that's going to go on into forever
 
02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
and obviously it won't uh although the
 
02:14:19.309 --> 02:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
funding has been very generous we have
 
02:14:21.070 --> 02:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
the $10 million right now and it's over
 
02:14:24.469 --> 02:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
$50 million that commission has had so
 
02:14:26.110 --> 02:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps what it's best for us to do
 
02:14:29.070 --> 02:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
right now is to skip over this bill get
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment made to keep those first
 
02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
sentences in place and to delete the
 
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
portion where you were required to meet
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
monthly right now we're at a kind of a
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
reprieve because we've had the money
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
been you know we're already in that
 
02:14:47.670 --> 02:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
process and there's no need to meet
 
02:14:50.469 --> 02:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
monthly uh until we we have to start
 
02:14:52.070 --> 02:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing those applications to come in
 
02:14:53.950 --> 02:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
from Homeland
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
Security so are there any other areas
 
02:14:59.309 --> 02:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
within this technical changes above that
 
02:15:01.550 --> 02:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
your rep Cornell the this wasn't in the
 
02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
bill but I think the representative from
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
the contractors was concerned because on
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
the department website it only listed
 
02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
four recommended and that that was a
 
02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
problem cuz cuz he said people were
 
02:15:14.309 --> 02:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
looking at it thinking those were the
 
02:15:14.319 --> 02:15:15.389 align:start position:0%
looking at it thinking those were the
only

02:15:15.389 --> 02:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:15:17.790 --> 02:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
four Yes actually right after that
 
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
meeting we went and we updated our
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
website and put a little paragraph
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
clarifying that those are the um that
 
02:15:27.550 --> 02:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
they're not the only ones there thank
 
02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:28.990 align:start position:0%
they're not the only ones there thank
you

02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:15:32.189 --> 02:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
y so are there any other issues
 
02:15:35.269 --> 02:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
associated with that Amendment we could
 
02:15:37.070 --> 02:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
get another amendment put together and
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate because I want if they're not
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let you know mcart go back
 
02:15:44.110 --> 02:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
to Doe and get on with her job over
 
02:15:45.389 --> 02:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
there there's no sense for her to hang
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
around till we act on this later on
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
today when we get a new
 
02:15:52.429 --> 02:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment yeah uh just a clarification
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
on um those crossed out
 
02:15:58.469 --> 02:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
lines that you need to put back in the
 
02:15:59.830 --> 02:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
first meeting of the commission shall be
 
02:16:02.110 --> 02:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
called by the first named House member
 
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
and then I thought I heard you say the
 
02:16:03.880 --> 02:16:05.550 align:start position:0%
and then I thought I heard you say the
last

02:16:05.550 --> 02:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the not the next can't even speak
 
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
the line after the next one that says
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
the commission shall meet at least
 
02:16:18.389 --> 02:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
monthly and I thought I heard um Amy say
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
that some months they don't have any
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
business so does that have to be worded
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
rewarded so that the commission it's
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
just deleted it's going to be deleted I
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure you were so that's where we'
 
02:16:33.550 --> 02:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
be and that that's been we've talked
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.309 --> 02:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
commission represent Woodcock thank CH
 
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
just to be clear when you come back with
 
02:16:42.429 --> 02:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
the revised Amendment you you're still
 
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
going to leave the preschool piece in
 
02:16:46.269 --> 02:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
there right the what part preschool line
 
02:16:49.630 --> 02:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
21 you're not changing that nothing I
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
don't when you bring back the new we're
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
only looking for the one section that
 
02:16:55.269 --> 02:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
we've been just addressing now to change
 
02:16:57.550 --> 02:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
everything else remains in place as
 
02:16:59.550 --> 02:16:59.560 align:start position:0%

greatly appreciate the language of the
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
last four lines addressing the air
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
quality discussion that we had and okay
 
02:17:13.229 --> 02:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
we we will be having further discussion
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
this thing but I think Amy you're off
 
02:17:18.189 --> 02:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
the hook that we know where we're going
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
with this and appreciate it thank you
 
02:17:23.550 --> 02:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
you're waiting for that I have another

squeezing me in before lunch okay so
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take action on that
 
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
now we're going to just get an amendment
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
made and we got to now trip to 1212
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is eligibility for free School
 
02:17:40.590 --> 02:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
meals so we can let the other group
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
loose too
 
02:17:50.269 --> 02:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.279 --> 02:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
for

02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:17:56.429 --> 02:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility for free School meals we
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
have representa beler do you want make
 
02:18:01.229 --> 02:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
motion on that yes Mr chair I would move
 
02:18:02.670 --> 02:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
um in expedient to
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislate is a second second Is there
 
02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:08.150 align:start position:0%
legislate is a second second Is there
further

02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
discussion from the maker of the
 
02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
motion yes Mr chair thank you um so what
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is it would it
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
would increase the threshold for
 
02:18:24.269 --> 02:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
providing free and reduced U meals and
 
02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
schools from the current federal
 
02:18:29.229 --> 02:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines of it's about about 180% of
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level and it would
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
increase it to
 
02:18:36.150 --> 02:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
350% of federal poverty level um however
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
unlike the the current situation where
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
the state is reimbursed for these um
 
02:18:44.429 --> 02:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures this would be entirely out
 
02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
of state coffers um and out of the uh
 
02:18:50.189 --> 02:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayer funds now the
 
02:18:52.349 --> 02:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal note we have on this demonstrates
 
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
that this uh is estimated to run more
 
02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
than $50 million per year with more than
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
or about a half a million of that being
 
02:19:03.269 --> 02:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
oversight of this particular program and
 
02:19:05.229 --> 02:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
with all of that it is very important to
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
note that even though this money is
 
02:19:09.510 --> 02:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
coming from the New Hampshire taxpayer
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
for this program the New Hampshire ta
 
02:19:13.309 --> 02:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
tax payer and us as their
 
02:19:15.870 --> 02:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
representatives have very little ability
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
to affect the expenditures of these
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
funds because it ties the funding to the
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
existing Federal USDA program meaning
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we would have to follow all federal
 
02:19:27.349 --> 02:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines from everything from
 
02:19:28.950 --> 02:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
nutrition to bidding process and
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
everything else on these funds um and I
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
do not believe that is a that's a wise
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
use of new taxpayer funds I believe if
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
we are to Institute any sort of expanded
 
02:19:40.110 --> 02:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
program like that it is something that
 
02:19:41.790 --> 02:19:41.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is paying for and we
 
02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
should totally control it from top to
 
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
bottom thank
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
you okay uh there was a sheet do does
 
02:19:53.070 --> 02:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
this make of the second one this discuss
 
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
already want to get into this sheet
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
right here which came
 
02:20:00.349 --> 02:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
around uh we have this sheet that was
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
handed to us I don't think you can read
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
that from there but you can unlike the
 
02:20:08.269 --> 02:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
borrow your eyes
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
um they copies do you have copies of
 
02:20:11.439 --> 02:20:12.510 align:start position:0%
um they copies do you have copies of
this

02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
okay could could this be walked through
 
02:20:23.269 --> 02:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
explained um good afternoon um that
 
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
Kelly Rambo from the Department of
 
02:20:30.110 --> 02:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
Education Bureau administrator for
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
wellness and nutrition I'm mam Marshall
 
02:20:34.269 --> 02:20:34.279 align:start position:0%
um administrator for the office of
 
02:20:38.269 --> 02:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.389 --> 02:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
services so I believe that we had sent
 
02:20:41.399 --> 02:20:42.750 align:start position:0%
services so I believe that we had sent
two

02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
um two follow-up documents to um when we
 
02:20:50.110 --> 02:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
were here last and um
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
the one that has two charts on it or it
 
02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:55.990 align:start position:0%
the one that has two charts on it or it
looks

02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
looks
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
like yes yes yeah this one yes um so
 
02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
this one that's in front of
 
02:21:06.750 --> 02:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
you um when we came last um we gave the
 
02:21:09.710 --> 02:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
number that if all students in the state
 
02:21:12.189 --> 02:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire were to get meals all
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
enrolled students in the state of New
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and schools um and from that
 
02:21:18.910 --> 02:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
feedback what we thought might be
 
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
helpful to see is actual um School meals
 
02:21:26.870 --> 02:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
that were served for the school year
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
2223 so that you can see a comparison of
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
the if all children and students were to
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
eat what the cost would be versus what
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
actual meals were served at the local
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
level and what the cost was for that for
 
02:21:44.750 --> 02:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
2022 to
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
2023 so that's what that um that chart
 
02:21:51.389 --> 02:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
is if you turn are there any any
 
02:21:53.309 --> 02:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
questions on that chart from the from
 
02:21:57.189 --> 02:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
the committee Damon thank you
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
um I may be very confused so please help
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
me understand this this is the side of
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
the page you're referring to correct yes
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
the title should be 2223 data with
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
FY Federal reimbursement y 24 Federal
 
02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement okay so we're looking at
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
the same
 
02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:17.550 align:start position:0%
the same
thing

02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
Isen please again the difference between
 
02:22:26.349 --> 02:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
the top and the bottom because the
 
02:22:29.309 --> 02:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
titles are all exactly the same sure so
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
the top half is the based on
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility and those students that are
 
02:22:42.269 --> 02:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
enrolled in school for 2223 so that's
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
um an average of let's just say 160,000
 
02:22:47.550 --> 02:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
students in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:22:49.269 --> 02:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
that are enrolled in schools that's the
 
02:22:51.469 --> 02:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
number that's on the top chart when you
 
02:22:53.870 --> 02:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
go down to the bottom chart what we did
 
02:22:56.429 --> 02:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
was we took the actual meals that were
 
02:23:00.229 --> 02:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
served last school year and applied that
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
number to actual meals that are being
 
02:23:05.309 --> 02:23:05.319 align:start position:0%
served so we know that um although the
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
top number is is what we've given you as
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
a um let's say it's the maximum amount
 
02:23:12.389 --> 02:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
that it could cost
 
02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
we thought it might be helpful to see
 
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
when you actually break it down and
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
apply to actual meals being served in
 
02:23:21.389 --> 02:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
the school what that number looks like
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
may I follow up
 
02:23:26.429 --> 02:23:26.439 align:start position:0%
yes so just to verify what I'm
 
02:23:28.750 --> 02:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
understanding from you the top number is
 
02:23:31.790 --> 02:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
what it would be if we were feeding both
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch to all public school
 
02:23:37.269 --> 02:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
students is that correct correct and the
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
bottom number is what we actually are
 
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
doing currently or last year last year
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
um so that is the students who qualify
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
under the existing free and reduced
 
02:23:51.469 --> 02:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
meals that was from free and reduced
 
02:23:53.269 --> 02:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
numbers from last year because that's
 
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
the yes that's the data that we or 185%
 
02:23:59.309 --> 02:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
correct thank you very much and just
 
02:24:01.710 --> 02:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
follow so the cost to the state on the
 
02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
top table
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
there if if uh all kids were receiving
 
02:24:10.429 --> 02:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
would be 122 or $123
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
million that's correct and that's with
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
the federal reimbursement being applied
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
to that as well too so if the state were
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
to operate outside of the USDA um
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
operations and um not take the
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the federal
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
government that number would be
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
significantly higher and we can um get
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
those numbers for you if it's something
 
02:24:37.990 --> 02:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to to
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
see so th this number 120 three round
 
02:24:44.910 --> 02:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
rounding it off million that includes
 
02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
the federal dollars that's correct what
 
02:24:49.229 --> 02:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
would it be if those federal dollars
 
02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
were not what what are we putting in
 
02:24:54.269 --> 02:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
there to make this total come up to 122
 
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
we can get that number for you we don't
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay further questions yes represent
 
02:25:05.189 --> 02:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair can you also
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
get us a number two
 
02:25:11.710 --> 02:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
numbers um for all those students the
 
02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:13.550 align:start position:0%
numbers um for all those students the
top

02:25:13.550 --> 02:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
top
 
02:25:16.830 --> 02:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
160,000 if it's only breakfast or only
 
02:25:20.349 --> 02:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
lunch because the bill does not require
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
both meals it requires
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
one sure so um if you follow the the
 
02:25:31.870 --> 02:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
chart from um from left to right you can
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
see that free breakfast would cost
 
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
obviously there would be no cost to the
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
state because that reimbursement would
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
come from the federal government if you
 
02:25:43.189 --> 02:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
um follow the chart to say reduced
 
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
breakfast there are currently um
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
69 average students um and the state is
 
02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
already currently paying that portion
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
and that amount um so we can break it
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
down um outside of this chart if you
 
02:26:01.070 --> 02:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
would like um further though pretty
 
02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
would like um further though pretty
accurate

02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
though further questions yes
 
02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:07.429 align:start position:0%
though further questions yes
representative

02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
for your technical support I just wanted
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
to um because it was brought up that
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
this does not require um schools to
 
02:26:17.189 --> 02:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
provide both breakfast and lunch and I I
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
would strictly agree with that but would
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
you agree that this bill enables local
 
02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
schools to decide that they will provide
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
both meals for free because it says each
 
02:26:30.510 --> 02:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
School Board shall make at least one
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
meal available during this the school
 
02:26:33.870 --> 02:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
hours to every people under his
 
02:26:35.630 --> 02:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so that's existing language
 
02:26:38.349 --> 02:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
but this raising that threshold and
 
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
promising to fund it from the New
 
02:26:42.229 --> 02:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer um would it be
 
02:26:44.429 --> 02:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable to conclude that many schools
 
02:26:49.389 --> 02:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
both yes um however the as the the bill
 
02:26:56.830 --> 02:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
reads um it's only one um identifying
 
02:26:59.309 --> 02:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
one meal for them um that they shall
 
02:26:59.319 --> 02:27:01.630 align:start position:0%
one meal for them um that they shall
provide

02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
that at least yeah at least yeah further
 
02:27:07.189 --> 02:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm still
 
02:27:15.429 --> 02:27:15.439 align:start position:0%
confused about this and you know it's
 
02:27:18.750 --> 02:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's new all new stuff to me uh you
 
02:27:21.510 --> 02:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned another level of decision by
 
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
the state I don't understand what else
 
02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
there is they decide you said if said
 
02:27:30.309 --> 02:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
they should decide
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
to sure um thank you for the question um
 
02:27:37.229 --> 02:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
just for clarification if the state
 
02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
entity as a whole were to decide to not
 
02:27:45.229 --> 02:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal the USDA
 
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
Federal Child Nutrition program um
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant by if the state were
 
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
to decide to to go outside of the
 
02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
program and not elect to follow those
 
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines they would not be eligible to
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
receive the federal reimbursement that
 
02:28:02.550 --> 02:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
comes with that okay thank you represent
 
02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
02:28:07.269 --> 02:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um just
 
02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
to go back to the two charts again they
 
02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
both include
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
all students so if I look at the bottom
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
chart it's it's every student then that
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
program so the top the top chart is for
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
those that are enrolled in public school
 
02:28:30.750 --> 02:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
currently so um not every single student
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
does partake in the program but the
 
02:28:34.870 --> 02:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
bottom chart does indicate the meals
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
that we're sered that were part of the
 
02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
program from last school year so yes
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay and just a follow up
 
02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
to to that so it it in no way indicates
 
02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the second chart down here what it
 
02:28:49.389 --> 02:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
would be if the uh threshold was risen
 
02:28:49.399 --> 02:28:50.269 align:start position:0%
would be if the uh threshold was risen
to

02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
350% that's correct we don't have that
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
we we don't have that data currently
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
okay repr cascad thank you Mr chair um
 
02:29:01.349 --> 02:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
just want to add to the committee since
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
we were talking about feeding kids um
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
recently the New Hampshire food bank has
 
02:29:08.469 --> 02:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
recognized that there is an underserved
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
region in the state and are expanding um
 
02:29:14.469 --> 02:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
their services to the North country
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
because it experiences the highest rate
 
02:29:19.309 --> 02:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
of food insecurity that was last
 
02:29:23.550 --> 02:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
week's um information with 10.2% of the
 
02:29:24.990 --> 02:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
residents and
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
14.9% of children are experence
 
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
experiencing hunger every
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
day now we wouldn't need this bill if
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
they were fed where they should be fed
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
but because they're not
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
how can you deny kids a hot meal every
 
02:29:48.910 --> 02:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
day so that they can learn in a more
 
02:29:50.910 --> 02:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate state of
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
mind just data that was in the newspaper
 
02:29:57.950 --> 02:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to share that thank you
 
02:30:03.189 --> 02:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
for that sorry Hall thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
um so this bill mirror is a bill from
 
02:30:10.349 --> 02:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
last year um House Bill 572 which passed
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
02:30:14.429 --> 02:30:14.439 align:start position:0%
it passed in the Full House and that was
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
300% so this one raises it to 350 but
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
all the other language is the same
 
02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
except for the um effective date um so
 
02:30:26.189 --> 02:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
it passed you know we have to feed kids
 
02:30:27.830 --> 02:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
kids can't go to school hungry or they
 
02:30:30.429 --> 02:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
do they do go to school hungry and I I
 
02:30:32.910 --> 02:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we can sit back and do
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
nothing about that uh we heard over half
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire children live in
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
households that have insufficient food
 
02:30:45.189 --> 02:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
half half of our kids School meals play
 
02:30:48.269 --> 02:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
a critical role in their health Wellness
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh academic
 
02:30:52.189 --> 02:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
success um this bill would alleviate
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
food insecurity it helps support good
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
nutrition and you know we give kids
 
02:31:01.229 --> 02:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
computers we give kids books we give
 
02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
them the tools for learning but an
 
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
essential part of living is being fed so
 
02:31:12.229 --> 02:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's a basic necessity of Life uh
 
02:31:14.229 --> 02:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
last year on this bill one of the Big
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
stumbly Blocks I felt was it never went
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
to finance it wasn't even though it had
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note there nothing there it
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
never went to finance so that was always
 
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
a stumbling block yeah but Finance
 
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't seen it well this year it is an
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
early Bill and and it should go to
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
finance so I would strongly urge you to
 
02:31:35.189 --> 02:31:35.199 align:start position:0%
support this the least we can do are
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
there any further questions to the
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
department regarding the these sheets
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
right here because we will have that
 
02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
again I wanted to De delve a little
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
deeper into your response um when it
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
came to what you said the federal
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
government would do if we went outside
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
the USDA program you said they would
 
02:32:00.670 --> 02:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
they would suspend all funding so I so I
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify and ask you is it
 
02:32:04.229 --> 02:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say then that the federal
 
02:32:07.469 --> 02:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
government is going would prevent the
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire from developing
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
our own food nutrition program providing
 
02:32:12.710 --> 02:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
these schools using New Hampshire
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars on our own guidelines
 
02:32:16.830 --> 02:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
under threat of cutting all federal
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
funding for School meals thank you for
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
the question um just to I guess rephrase
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
my um answer from before it was that if
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
the state chose to not use the
 
02:32:32.870 --> 02:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and wanted to do something
 
02:32:35.670 --> 02:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
else that they that there obviously are
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
certain parameters and guidelines in
 
02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
order to be able to get the funding um
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
and and that was kind of the basis of
 
02:32:45.950 --> 02:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
the question um excuse me of of my
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
answer for for
 
02:32:50.469 --> 02:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
that so just trying to get a little
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
definition the bottom figure here your $
 
02:32:53.040 --> 02:32:55.910 align:start position:0%
definition the bottom figure here your $
34.7

02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
34.7
 
02:32:58.269 --> 02:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
million is that money that's coming out
 
02:33:03.990 --> 02:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:08.189 --> 02:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
that so um the $34 million that is on
 
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom there um no um if you can see
 
02:33:15.790 --> 02:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
that the total cost for um that the
 
02:33:17.469 --> 02:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
state is currently paying right now
 
02:33:19.389 --> 02:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
02:33:22.550 --> 02:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
$269,000 that currently is coming out of
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
that um because that's what the is in
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
statute and the state pays for the
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
reduced price breakfast um for those
 
02:33:31.229 --> 02:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
kiddos that um so that they don't have
 
02:33:34.469 --> 02:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
to pay that price and what um the the
 
02:33:37.150 --> 02:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
one above that was um just for
 
02:33:40.389 --> 02:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
convenience um to the reduced price
 
02:33:43.150 --> 02:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
lunges if that were to be included um in
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
in that as well too which is currently
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
not being paid by the
 
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
state you you in 296,000 you're talking
 
02:33:55.429 --> 02:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
right yes 296,000 is currently being
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
paid by the state correct for the
 
02:34:00.229 --> 02:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
reduced price
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
breakfast okay and that's at
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
300% no that's at 185% 185 so correct
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
reduced I'm trying to find out what
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
we're how much the state is actually
 
02:34:16.110 --> 02:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
having to pay to sustain the program
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's being requested that's what I'm
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
trying to drive at and unfortunately
 
02:34:24.349 --> 02:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
without having the data of those
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
families that would qualify
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
for um the 186 to
 
02:34:34.590 --> 02:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
350 we can't give you that exact number
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
um which is why we had given the
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
original 122 million so that you could
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
see if all enrolled students um it it
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
very well could be less than that um but
 
02:34:47.229 --> 02:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's the number that we were
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
with the data that we have um also on
 
02:34:51.630 --> 02:34:51.640 align:start position:0%
the back end it looks like on
 
02:34:55.950 --> 02:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's page um we did provide some
 
02:34:59.710 --> 02:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
additional data um back to
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
201819 on meal served so that you could
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
see um and um Amanda oh I do have it
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and so so this does break it this
 
02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
does break it down um what the total
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursements um for the state were and
 
02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
again this is actual meal served from
 
02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:34.309 align:start position:0%
again this is actual meal served from
201

02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
201
 
02:35:34.319 --> 02:35:35.910 align:start position:0%
201
1819

02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
1819
 
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
2020 to 21 you can see that um the
 
02:35:42.229 --> 02:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
heading there is meals were at no cost
 
02:35:46.189 --> 02:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
learning on the other side you can see
 
02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
that 21 to 22 meals were still at no
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
cost to students as the federal
 
02:35:59.389 --> 02:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
government was paying for those then um
 
02:36:02.429 --> 02:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
but that was back to in-person learning
 
02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
and then the last chart on the bottom is
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
2223 and that's with in-person learning
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
and back to being charged by free
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
reduced and paid and the federal
 
02:36:16.189 --> 02:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
government was not subsidizing the total
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
cost of meals for um students so we just
 
02:36:22.870 --> 02:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to give a um kind of
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
overarching um I know it's a lot of
 
02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
numbers and I I know it's um um somewhat
 
02:36:30.189 --> 02:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
daunting so um please if there uh are
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
any additional questions even after this
 
02:36:36.070 --> 02:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
um we'll be happy to answer them Celli
 
02:36:37.590 --> 02:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you for sticking
 
02:36:42.830 --> 02:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
around today um on the um the line that
 
02:36:46.189 --> 02:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
the chairman was referring to the two
 
02:36:46.199 --> 02:36:47.790 align:start position:0%
the chairman was referring to the two
$296,000

02:36:47.790 --> 02:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
$296,000
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
plus um it says the state is currently
 
02:36:54.670 --> 02:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
paying reduced breakfast amount
 
02:36:56.830 --> 02:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
therefore the total additional cost to
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
state to the cover the reduced excuse me
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying the reduced
 
02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
they're they're paying the reduced
breakfast

02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
amount is this the 296 is that the total
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
paid for the reduced breakfast amount or
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
is that the total to cover the
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
additional uh cost of reduced
 
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
lunch that's the um the total to for the
 
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
for the the um the lunch that's the
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
additional portion for the lunch if you
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
go to the top um and follow from left to
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
right the reduced breakfast price you'll
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
see that
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
98,000 is currently what's being paid by
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
the state um what was paid by the state
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
last year for for the breakfast if I can
 
02:37:44.229 --> 02:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so then um to get the
 
02:37:47.590 --> 02:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
state payment for reduced breakfast and
 
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch you'd add the 296 and the
 
02:37:54.110 --> 02:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
98 correct to get the 395 that it's
 
02:37:58.269 --> 02:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
right above that gotcha okay okay other
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
leus thank you for taking my question um
 
02:38:06.990 --> 02:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I understand on that
 
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
second chart where it says paid lunch
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
um 30
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
million that was paid by the students is
 
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct that is
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
02:38:24.269 --> 02:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions for
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Department yes represent luno sure
 
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
and and thanks m m Rambo um I I think
 
02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
this question's been asked before I'm
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
sure it's been asked before but I'm just
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
a little thick uh this afternoon so the
 
02:38:40.520 --> 02:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
a little thick uh this afternoon so the
$122

02:38:42.790 --> 02:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
$122
 
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
state let me ask you another one what's
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
the $122 million sure thank you for the
 
02:38:58.110 --> 02:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
question um so the $122 million would be
 
02:39:00.429 --> 02:39:00.439 align:start position:0%
um if I can rephrase it that if the
 
02:39:03.389 --> 02:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
state were to pay for Universal meals
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
for all students enrolled um in the
 
02:39:08.189 --> 02:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that would be the
 
02:39:11.189 --> 02:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
cost to the state
 
02:39:14.189 --> 02:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
with the federal reimbursement already
 
02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
take it into consideration after Federal
 
02:39:17.469 --> 02:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement correct after Federal
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
reimb follow up Mr chair yeah so if
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a program that would
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
would cover meals for um 0 to
 
02:39:31.189 --> 02:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
350% of the federal poverty level and we
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:39:37.309 --> 02:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
350% is a little bit above the the mean
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
um household income uh in New Hampshire
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
so between 50 and
 
02:39:46.830 --> 02:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
60% of of households would be inside of
 
02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:47.670 align:start position:0%
60% of of households would be inside of
that

02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:50.349 --> 02:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
350 that I know this is a little bit
 
02:39:53.630 --> 02:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
engineering finger in the wind but but
 
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
the total cost for 350 per for the
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
program up to 350% would be about
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
between yeah 50 or 60% of that 122
 
02:40:07.870 --> 02:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
million yes in the fiscal note we did
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
make that calculation that is about 60 %
 
02:40:14.429 --> 02:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
of the students in the 160,000 students
 
02:40:16.229 --> 02:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire could potentially cost
 
02:40:20.269 --> 02:40:20.279 align:start position:0%
about $75 million okay thank you very
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
much represent
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you I have a question that's
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
not related to these sheets specifically
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it is for the Department is that
 
02:40:34.630 --> 02:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I I just um wanted to
 
02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
ask if you could clarify um the
 
02:40:41.150 --> 02:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
difference between food insufficiency
 
02:40:44.189 --> 02:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
and food security and the reason I ask
 
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
is because on New Hampshire hunger
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions website um and I know it's not
 
02:40:52.229 --> 02:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
the department website they have some
 
02:40:55.229 --> 02:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
interesting data and they have uh I'm
 
02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
not sure how they did this survey um but
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
the categories are enough food but not
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
always the kinds wanted and often not
 
02:41:07.229 --> 02:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
enough to eat sometimes not enough to
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
eat did not report level and
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
than the total quantity of all of the
 
02:41:16.670 --> 02:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
other three and in households with
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
children out of 164,000 respondents
 
02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:25.399 align:start position:0%
9,957 said they had enough food but not
 
02:41:28.149 --> 02:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
always the kind they wanted and then
 
02:41:30.189 --> 02:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
often not enough eat was
 
02:41:33.070 --> 02:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
16,000 sometimes not enough to eat is um
 
02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:34.110 align:start position:0%
16,000 sometimes not enough to eat is um
basically

02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:41:37.550 --> 02:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
19,000 and did not report the level
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
is about 38,000 and then I do have a
 
02:41:45.590 --> 02:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
followup thank you for the question um
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm not familiar with that
 
02:41:49.950 --> 02:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
survey that has been done um and I would
 
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
have to since it's not our data I'd have
 
02:41:55.389 --> 02:41:55.399 align:start position:0%
to inquire with Hunger Solutions um and
 
02:41:57.149 --> 02:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I I can't answer that
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
question right
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
now but can you define the difference
 
02:42:03.309 --> 02:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
between um food insufficiency and
 
02:42:06.189 --> 02:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
insecurity please um I'd have to get
 
02:42:08.630 --> 02:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
back to you on that related to to the
 
02:42:11.710 --> 02:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
survey and what they they were asking
 
02:42:14.990 --> 02:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
on you typically do you typically work
 
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
with insecurity is is that how the
 
02:42:19.630 --> 02:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
department goes by their data or do you
 
02:42:21.309 --> 02:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
not look into that at all you just go by
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
the Numbers we don't we rely on the free
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
and reduced numbers okay um can I ask
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
one more question please um is there
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
anything that would prevent a local
 
02:42:38.030 --> 02:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
community from donating money to um
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
support students who needed
 
02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
um more food in the school so it would
 
02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
it be possible to say donate money and
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
say can you give this to the student who
 
02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
owes the most money right now for um
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
their reduced lunch that they couldn't
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
pay without identifying student
 
02:42:58.750 --> 02:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
information um could you um do have
 
02:43:01.309 --> 02:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
regular fundraisers to send more money
 
02:43:04.429 --> 02:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
to the school so could the local schools
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
incorporate this
 
02:43:08.910 --> 02:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
350% on their own without this
 
02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:10.429 align:start position:0%
350% on their own without this
legislation

02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:43:13.070 --> 02:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so there
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
is the capability um since it is local
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
control for the schools to be able to do
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
that they should have a a policy um in
 
02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
place for um donations or something of
 
02:43:24.830 --> 02:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
that kind so there is that capability
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be a local level control
 
02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:27.750 align:start position:0%
and that would be a local level control
for

02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
that other questions on the technical
 
02:43:32.910 --> 02:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
stuff here from the Department because
 
02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:34.750 align:start position:0%
stuff here from the Department because
yes

02:43:34.750 --> 02:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
yes isn't isn't the um free and reduced
 
02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:40.990 align:start position:0%
yes isn't isn't the um free and reduced
lunch

02:43:40.990 --> 02:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
um statistics based or a basis for kind
 
02:43:51.070 --> 02:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
of quas what the what the community's um
 
02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
is thank you for that question um that
 
02:44:00.189 --> 02:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
is outside of my office um and
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I cannot answer that
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
question okay if if it if it was I would
 
02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
think that the community would not be
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
totally in a position to donate enough
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
money to then fund all the kids that
 
02:44:14.469 --> 02:44:14.479 align:start position:0%
that's my point okay we're we're getting
 
02:44:16.229 --> 02:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit beyond the pale here in
 
02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the technical support I want to
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank we're we're really we
 
02:44:25.469 --> 02:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
got a number of issues coming up before
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
us today we haven't had lunch yet it's
 
02:44:30.229 --> 02:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
1:00 we got to be back at
 
02:44:35.149 --> 02:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
1:45 if it's very specific about the
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
numbers go ahead represent Damon thank
 
02:44:40.510 --> 02:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair and I do want to
 
02:44:42.149 --> 02:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
note the irony that we're talking about
 
02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
feeding hungry kids while we are all
 
02:44:45.229 --> 02:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
sitting here
 
02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
hungry on a shortterm level so my
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
question is on the enlarg page that you
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
handed out the 2021 2022 data when we
 
02:45:00.229 --> 02:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
returned to in-person learning but meals
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
were still at no
 
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
cost how who were the students who were
 
02:45:06.389 --> 02:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
getting those meals was that Universal
 
02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
meals or was that x% of
 
02:45:12.389 --> 02:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so that was
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
Universal meals um and just the the
 
02:45:18.630 --> 02:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
terminology um that we are using meals
 
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
at no cost um so that it doesn't get
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
confused with the the free reduced
 
02:45:26.269 --> 02:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
status um so that's the the terminology
 
02:45:28.510 --> 02:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
for meals at no cost thank you very much
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
and represent
 
02:45:34.030 --> 02:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
LE thank you so looking at numbers there
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
are numbers or kids or something missing
 
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
as in we we have the total amount that
 
02:45:46.990 --> 02:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
was paid and then if all kids were and
 
02:45:49.229 --> 02:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
in and in this one as well we ended up
 
02:45:53.429 --> 02:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
with 86 million as opposed to 122 so is
 
02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
that difference either kids who aren't
 
02:45:58.510 --> 02:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
eating lunch or kids who are bringing
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
lunch so is bringing lunch why there's a
 
02:46:06.149 --> 02:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
difference thank you for the question so
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes the the top number on um the with
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
two of them is that if all students were
 
02:46:17.429 --> 02:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
to eat meals at school and be provided a
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
meal at school and not bring a bagged
 
02:46:22.110 --> 02:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
lunch um the other chart that um Amanda
 
02:46:25.870 --> 02:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
handed out is the actual meals that were
 
02:46:28.030 --> 02:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
served to those students that ate at
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
school not not the the um the brown bag
 
02:46:33.309 --> 02:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
or or other lunches that were um brought
 
02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
gonna

02:46:41.110 --> 02:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
represent Woodcock go for it but that
 
02:46:46.269 --> 02:46:46.279 align:start position:0%
this is the last
 
02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you um on the expanded
 
02:46:51.790 --> 02:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
chart on the fall off the represent D on
 
02:46:53.550 --> 02:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
expanded chart of the return to
 
02:46:57.309 --> 02:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
inpersonal learning the total cost was
 
02:47:02.590 --> 02:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.389 --> 02:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
right and 2223 on the shot the other
 
02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
side we got today visual slide one you
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
have that would be in today's prices
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
that would be 122 million so we've gone
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
up almost $40 million in a year for the
 
02:47:19.870 --> 02:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
cost is that of the
 
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
meal so the one with the four charts
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
those were the actual meals served so
 
02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
the 86 million was what the federal kind
 
02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
of reimbursements and all the
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursements end of the day the actual
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
meal served the top chart is just all of
 
02:47:39.950 --> 02:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
the students that are enrolled in the
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
schools if they eat both breakfast and
 
02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
lunch for the 180 days of the school
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
year thank you thank you thank you very
 
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
much and thank you to just to to follow
 
02:47:54.550 --> 02:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
up on that the reason we wanted to show
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
you the um the second chart with the
 
02:47:59.950 --> 02:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
actual meal served at no cost is to show
 
02:48:04.110 --> 02:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
that um the difference between if
 
02:48:06.950 --> 02:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
students were to pay for their meals and
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
you can see that um it is a significant
 
02:48:13.269 --> 02:48:13.279 align:start position:0%
amount higher if the meals are at no
 
02:48:15.110 --> 02:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
cost to them and there are additional
 
02:48:17.149 --> 02:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
students eating so we just wanted to
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
give those comparison um numbers and
 
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much for spending
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
the time with us today appreciate
 
02:48:26.149 --> 02:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
it um what we're going to do is we're
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
going to take a break right now
 
02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
um I think we've gone beyond the pale on
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
on a lot of things here um we do still
 
02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
have some exact sessions that take place
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
02:48:41.950 --> 02:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
and we're taking a break right now we'll
 
02:48:43.630 --> 02:48:43.640 align:start position:0%
come back to this executive session
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
we'll continue following the hearings

public school infrastructure fund which

2018 dealing with safety security access
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
in our schools plus it had some other
 
03:35:44.709 --> 03:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
components which the infrastructure
 
03:35:47.269 --> 03:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
could be you fund could be used for uh
 
03:35:49.869 --> 03:35:49.879 align:start position:0%
for issues that impacted certain
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure within the facilities
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
that the government Governor saw fit to
 
03:35:58.230 --> 03:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
use we also had rate which is a uh a
 
03:36:00.189 --> 03:36:00.199 align:start position:0%

the eate has gone and since that time
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%

State Board of
 
03:37:03.189 --> 03:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
Education and we're all tasked to look
 
03:37:05.230 --> 03:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
at how we're going to make the these
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
buildings safer and the environment the
 
03:37:09.551 --> 03:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in our state that's
 
03:37:12.990 --> 03:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
relative to education safer for
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
students the task force report that came
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
out in
 
03:37:21.109 --> 03:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
2018 had at least 48 separate
 
03:37:24.150 --> 03:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations within it and they all
 
03:37:27.070 --> 03:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
reference how we can better prepare stud
 
03:37:30.990 --> 03:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
our teachers students administrators to
 
03:37:33.230 --> 03:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
react in terms of if there is a
 
03:37:34.949 --> 03:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
situation that occurs within a building
 
03:37:36.910 --> 03:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
buildings so it goes even with
 
03:37:39.029 --> 03:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
recommendations for professional
 
03:37:41.390 --> 03:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
development to how we're going to build
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
buildings how we're going to maintain
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
buildings how we're going to control
 
03:37:48.590 --> 03:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
access to safety Communications with uh
 
03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
emergency responders it's a Well Done uh
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
a document of which we've enacted many
 
03:37:57.789 --> 03:37:57.799 align:start position:0%
of those recommendations internally
 
03:37:58.949 --> 03:37:58.959 align:start position:0%
within that
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
report the commission has met and we
 
03:38:05.789 --> 03:38:05.799 align:start position:0%
have looked at numerous applic s that
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
have come in from school districts
 
03:38:09.709 --> 03:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
there's application process which goes
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
out and and then uh various communities
 
03:38:18.109 --> 03:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
schools can apply for these funds up to
 
03:38:22.390 --> 03:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh for each project um so we've
 
03:38:25.310 --> 03:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
gone ahead with that the discussions we
 
03:38:28.789 --> 03:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
have have been done in closed sessions
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a commission what has to do
 
03:38:34.109 --> 03:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
this in terms of we're dealing with
 
03:38:36.990 --> 03:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
issues which we don't want everybody out
 
03:38:39.310 --> 03:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
there in John Q public to know what how
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
the safety conditions are and how we're
 
03:38:43.029 --> 03:38:43.039 align:start position:0%
responding those conditions in any
 
03:38:43.039 --> 03:38:44.029 align:start position:0%
responding those conditions in any
specific

03:38:44.029 --> 03:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:38:46.551 --> 03:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
school and the criteria in which we're
 
03:38:48.910 --> 03:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
looking to evaluate and priority is also
 
03:38:51.470 --> 03:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
done by Homeland Security with
 
03:38:53.230 --> 03:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming forward and in
 
03:38:55.150 --> 03:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the department and
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
those recommendations come back to the
 
03:39:00.629 --> 03:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
commission for us to recommend recommend
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
those projects then it goes on the
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal then onto governor and councel
 
03:39:07.349 --> 03:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
for approval we've already had a bill
 
03:39:09.390 --> 03:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
that deals with the process there in
 
03:39:12.029 --> 03:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to shorten that up which
 
03:39:14.390 --> 03:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
is absolutely necessary we do that this
 
03:39:16.269 --> 03:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
looks this bill looks at one of the
 
03:39:20.990 --> 03:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
components within the the statutory uses
 
03:39:22.349 --> 03:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
for these
 
03:39:24.830 --> 03:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
monies and one of the issues this bill
 
03:39:28.869 --> 03:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
was initially put in with the idea of
 
03:39:31.310 --> 03:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
scratching out item F which was the
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
energy efficient school buses or other
 
03:39:34.869 --> 03:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
vehicles used for transportation
 
03:39:37.430 --> 03:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
students the commission discussed this
 
03:39:39.390 --> 03:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
at the last Commission meeting we had I
 
03:39:41.350 --> 03:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
I posed a question about this
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill and one of the representatives
 
03:39:46.310 --> 03:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's on that commission said wait a
 
03:39:48.590 --> 03:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
minute and she happens to be on this
 
03:39:48.600 --> 03:39:49.910 align:start position:0%
minute and she happens to be on this
committee

03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:39:52.110 --> 03:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
today suggested well isn't
 
03:39:54.270 --> 03:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure on the bus just as
 
03:39:56.590 --> 03:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
important we all thought about it for a
 
03:39:59.310 --> 03:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
second and said yes cameras are
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
necessary on those buses if there's an
 
03:40:03.390 --> 03:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
issue on a bus that's part of the
 
03:40:05.948 --> 03:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of that school
 
03:40:09.150 --> 03:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
system the bill itself says energy
 
03:40:12.708 --> 03:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
efficient school buses in terms of the
 
03:40:16.110 --> 03:40:16.120 align:start position:0%
commission the commission feels all
 
03:40:20.868 --> 03:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
buses should be you know recognized as
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whether it's a bus that's
 
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
running on electricity or diesel
 
03:40:29.948 --> 03:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
or hydrogen I don't know um so so what
 
03:40:32.190 --> 03:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does and I have an amendment
 
03:40:35.110 --> 03:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
here for you and I'll pass it out and it
 
03:40:36.910 --> 03:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
can be passed
 
03:40:39.788 --> 03:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
around let me just pass this over to
 
03:40:39.798 --> 03:40:44.310 align:start position:0%
around let me just pass this over to
represent

03:40:44.310 --> 03:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:49.430 --> 03:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
belter the the amendment puts back in
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
school buses or other vehicles used for
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
transportation of students it puts a
 
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
unlike the bill as
 
03:40:58.590 --> 03:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
introduced the only two words taken out
 
03:41:01.788 --> 03:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
are energy efficient this is not I quote
 
03:41:06.150 --> 03:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
again this is not an e a DE program or a
 
03:41:08.948 --> 03:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
program which deals with this type of
 
03:41:11.190 --> 03:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
aspect like we dealt with lead and water
 
03:41:13.190 --> 03:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
remember we did that several years ago
 
03:41:16.430 --> 03:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
that was a DS uh uh perspective and
 
03:41:19.110 --> 03:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
something we we recognize has to be done
 
03:41:21.708 --> 03:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure monies right now
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
are being used for Access Control
 
03:41:28.830 --> 03:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
Communications safety of students
 
03:41:31.390 --> 03:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's energy efficient or
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
not and so it's the wrong place to
 
03:41:38.390 --> 03:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
address energy efficient since since the
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
commission has met we have not used that
 
03:41:42.510 --> 03:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
as a criteria and we haven't even
 
03:41:44.910 --> 03:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
discussed it we we are still working on
 
03:41:47.830 --> 03:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get our schools safe and we
 
03:41:50.430 --> 03:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
have spent this year we had $10 million
 
03:41:53.070 --> 03:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
which we're in the process of of of of
 
03:41:55.990 --> 03:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
and I think uh Miss Clark will explain
 
03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
that the applications have been looked
 
03:42:00.190 --> 03:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
at and it's we're going through those
 
03:42:00.200 --> 03:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
at and it's we're going through those
and

03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
awarding but uh it's it's
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh a criteria of the commission right
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
now that we look at all the
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
possibilities of what these can do and
 
03:42:14.430 --> 03:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the statute right now
 
03:42:16.948 --> 03:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
you'll see what areas within law we
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
address there's nothing in there I I
 
03:42:22.110 --> 03:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
truly believe by putting energy
 
03:42:25.110 --> 03:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
efficient buses in there alone was a
 
03:42:27.310 --> 03:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
misplace of where we put this in
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I'm not speaking to whether
 
03:42:31.708 --> 03:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
they're good bad or wrong or indifferent
 
03:42:33.868 --> 03:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
or what I'm just saying right now we
 
03:42:35.708 --> 03:42:35.718 align:start position:0%
need to address this issue but we need
 
03:42:38.910 --> 03:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
to address it as all school buses are
 
03:42:41.628 --> 03:42:41.638 align:start position:0%
part of the infrastructure program this
 
03:42:43.350 --> 03:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
was looked at by the commission and the
 
03:42:45.430 --> 03:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
commission was in agreement so I will
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and take any
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
questions if necessary uh thank you Mr
 
03:42:53.350 --> 03:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
chairman uh questions uh representative
 
03:42:55.390 --> 03:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you
 
03:42:58.708 --> 03:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
chair just just as an a slide you in
 
03:43:00.708 --> 03:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
your I have a problem with your mem bill
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's fine but in terms of energy
 
03:43:04.270 --> 03:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
efficient school buses do we have any
 
03:43:06.470 --> 03:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
IDE IDE how many are out there in the
 
03:43:08.670 --> 03:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
state I don't know you might ask Miss
 
03:43:11.350 --> 03:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
Clark that
 
03:43:15.430 --> 03:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
um in this weather this cold weather um
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
where you get half the mileage and and
 
03:43:19.708 --> 03:43:19.718 align:start position:0%
uh the costs of those things right now
 
03:43:21.868 --> 03:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
are horrendous you're talking
 
03:43:24.430 --> 03:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
4,000 so no I don't know how many are
 
03:43:27.030 --> 03:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
out there okay um there may be a pilot
 
03:43:28.708 --> 03:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
program somewhere which is done through
 
03:43:30.788 --> 03:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
grant money but this is not where we
 
03:43:33.190 --> 03:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
should be doing it honestly this has to
 
03:43:36.868 --> 03:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
be a separate yeah than thank you sure
 
03:43:38.750 --> 03:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
um any further
 
03:43:41.190 --> 03:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh seeing none thank you very
 
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome chairman next is
 
03:43:49.948 --> 03:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.470 --> 03:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
Dees welcome thank you um thank you
 
03:43:55.470 --> 03:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for the
 
03:43:58.030 --> 03:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jessica Wilcox and I
 
03:44:00.868 --> 03:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
supervise the mobile sources section in
 
03:44:02.590 --> 03:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
the air Resources Division at the
 
03:44:04.590 --> 03:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
basically we look at programs and
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
projects that support cleaner
 
03:44:11.948 --> 03:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
Transportation options while we take no
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we would just like
 
03:44:15.868 --> 03:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
to point out that energyefficient school
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
buses particularly electric buses are
 
03:44:20.990 --> 03:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
good for everybody from the public
 
03:44:22.948 --> 03:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
health benefits from the low to no
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
emissions that come to the economic
 
03:44:27.708 --> 03:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
benefits from fuel maintenance savings
 
03:44:29.230 --> 03:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
as such we just wanted to make the
 
03:44:31.310 --> 03:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee aware that there are currently
 
03:44:33.628 --> 03:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
a tons of funds being made available to
 
03:44:35.948 --> 03:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school schs through epa's
 
03:44:38.948 --> 03:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
clean School Bus program this program is
 
03:44:40.590 --> 03:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
being funded by the bipartisan
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure law and is providing five
 
03:44:45.628 --> 03:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
billion over five years starting fiscal
 
03:44:49.670 --> 03:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
year 2022 through 2026 to replace
 
03:44:51.310 --> 03:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
existing internal combustion engine
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
school buses with zero emission and as
 
03:44:57.150 --> 03:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
well as low emission models so if they
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
are electric school buses if a school
 
03:45:00.230 --> 03:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
district is interested in that
 
03:45:02.670 --> 03:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
technology this funding can also support
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
installation of charging infrastructure
 
03:45:06.190 --> 03:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
so it's really looking to kind of tuck
 
03:45:09.550 --> 03:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
in that whole project package so this
 
03:45:11.708 --> 03:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
PRI this program from EPA is
 
03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
prioritizing High need school districts
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
so think those that are in our that are
 
03:45:18.190 --> 03:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
in our rural areas and they end up
 
03:45:20.390 --> 03:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
receiving higher funding um what we
 
03:45:21.830 --> 03:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
looked what we saw in the very first
 
03:45:23.868 --> 03:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
rebate program that came out in 2022 was
 
03:45:25.628 --> 03:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
that this program actually provided
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
almost the entire cost of the electric
 
03:45:31.270 --> 03:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
School Bus for these priority schools so
 
03:45:33.948 --> 03:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
as a result of this summer 2022 EPA
 
03:45:36.670 --> 03:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
rebate program EPA ended up receiving
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
over 2,000 applications requesting
 
03:45:41.628 --> 03:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
nearly $4 billion for over 12,000 buses
 
03:45:43.430 --> 03:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
so there's definitely interested
 
03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
interest Nationwide in this program here
 
03:45:47.708 --> 03:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire rebates were actually
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
awarded to two priority to New Hampshire
 
03:45:51.868 --> 03:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
school districts in partnership with
 
03:45:53.430 --> 03:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
their school transportation provider
 
03:45:56.590 --> 03:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
Navistar so to answer your question uh
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
from earlier hener and rumney are
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
currently have been awarded funding for
 
03:46:02.788 --> 03:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
I think combined a total of seven
 
03:46:04.390 --> 03:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
electric school buses and they're
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
working with their provider to get that
 
03:46:07.350 --> 03:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
project off the ground and kind of
 
03:46:09.230 --> 03:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
navigate installing that charging
 
03:46:10.708 --> 03:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so they're getting
 
03:46:13.110 --> 03:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars for that a grant
 
03:46:15.350 --> 03:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
program was also released by EPA in
 
03:46:16.868 --> 03:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
summer 22 a little bit different from
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
that earlier rebate program which the
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
rebate program cash on the hood for any
 
03:46:21.910 --> 03:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
school districts that want to do it
 
03:46:24.070 --> 03:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
upfront funding the grant program meant
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
they might have to kind of field some
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
funding for a while before they could
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually apply for reimbursement and
 
03:46:31.628 --> 03:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
that grant program required larger
 
03:46:34.430 --> 03:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
projects then in Fall of 2023 a PA
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
opened a second rebate program because
 
03:46:38.270 --> 03:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
this funding is just in demand and
 
03:46:40.548 --> 03:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
expects to W at least 500 million in
 
03:46:43.390 --> 03:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
funding um as I mentioned this funding
 
03:46:44.948 --> 03:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
does cover almost the entire cost of the
 
03:46:45.868 --> 03:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
school I just want to make this
 
03:46:47.470 --> 03:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
committee aware there is tons of funding
 
03:46:49.390 --> 03:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
out there for energy efficient school
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
buses and I thank you for your time and
 
03:46:53.310 --> 03:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions thank you very
 
03:46:56.230 --> 03:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
much uh representative Heath thank you
 
03:46:58.510 --> 03:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you um that's most
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
interesting so our local New Hampshire
 
03:47:04.310 --> 03:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
school districts can apply directly
 
03:47:05.628 --> 03:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
that's correct they can either apply
 
03:47:07.310 --> 03:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
directly or with in partnership with
 
03:47:09.708 --> 03:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
their transportation provider you're
 
03:47:13.150 --> 03:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
welcome represent beler you Mr chair and
 
03:47:14.350 --> 03:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony about the
 
03:47:18.628 --> 03:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
EPA program um my question is to do with
 
03:47:21.548 --> 03:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
electric school buses um we had a
 
03:47:24.750 --> 03:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
situation happen in New York not New
 
03:47:26.708 --> 03:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
York City but New York State maybe a
 
03:47:29.310 --> 03:47:29.320 align:start position:0%
year or two ago uh people got stuck on
 
03:47:32.470 --> 03:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
the highway in a snowstorm uh dozens of
 
03:47:36.190 --> 03:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
people died and some of these people had
 
03:47:37.948 --> 03:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles who could not maintain
 
03:47:39.788 --> 03:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
heat over an extended period of time
 
03:47:40.868 --> 03:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
because they don't have that on board we
 
03:47:42.990 --> 03:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
live in a very cold climate so what is
 
03:47:45.270 --> 03:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
the circumstance for a Bus full of
 
03:47:47.270 --> 03:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
children stuck in a stuck in a highway
 
03:47:50.390 --> 03:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
in a snowstorm under such a circumstance
 
03:47:52.590 --> 03:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's interesting often times the heater
 
03:47:54.230 --> 03:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
is actually powered by diesel it's kind
 
03:47:56.270 --> 03:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
of an oxymoron to the whole electric
 
03:47:57.868 --> 03:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
school bus but the the school bus is
 
03:47:59.270 --> 03:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
being powered by the battery in the
 
03:48:01.150 --> 03:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
motor and often times the heating system
 
03:48:03.470 --> 03:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
is being fueled by diesel fuel so I
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
can't speak directly to it but you know
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
the each bus provider offers a different
 
03:48:09.708 --> 03:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
package but that certainly is an option
 
03:48:12.788 --> 03:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
to kind of ensure that doesn't happen
 
03:48:15.430 --> 03:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Hall
 
03:48:16.708 --> 03:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:48:19.150 --> 03:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
my question so you said two Romney and
 
03:48:21.708 --> 03:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
Romney ROM and H hener how many applied
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
that didn't get it or were they the only
 
03:48:25.270 --> 03:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
two who applied no there were more that
 
03:48:27.070 --> 03:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
applied but it was a lottery system in
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
the very first rebate round um I'm not
 
03:48:31.868 --> 03:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
sure how many were from New Hampshire
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
there on the EPA website there is a list
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
of those that are kind of on a waiting
 
03:48:38.430 --> 03:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
list um I do believe there was I I am
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
aware of two other schools that did
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
apply and did not and were not selected
 
03:48:43.948 --> 03:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
up in the North Country um but I'm not
 
03:48:47.270 --> 03:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
sure of sure of the total number um and
 
03:48:49.390 --> 03:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
additionally in top of the electric
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
school buses I know that there's a lot
 
03:48:51.708 --> 03:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
of propane powered school buses
 
03:48:53.430 --> 03:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
operating in the state and this funding
 
03:48:55.350 --> 03:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
from EPA also supports schools that are
 
03:48:57.470 --> 03:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
interested in that technology as well
 
03:49:00.150 --> 03:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
followup yes could you name those two
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
schools in the North Country I'm just
 
03:49:04.190 --> 03:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
curious um I believe it was Berlin I off
 
03:49:06.510 --> 03:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
the top of my head and Gore him okay
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions uh yes
 
03:49:11.390 --> 03:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell thank you and
 
03:49:13.390 --> 03:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
03:49:16.070 --> 03:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking energy efficient out of rep lad's
 
03:49:18.670 --> 03:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't affect energy efficient
 
03:49:21.548 --> 03:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
buses for schools not it won't affect
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
this funding not having that in this
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill is not going to affect school's
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
ability in the state of New Hampshire to
 
03:49:28.510 --> 03:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
apply for the EPA funding thank
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%

03:49:36.350 --> 03:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
round was a lottery is it a lottery
 
03:49:38.948 --> 03:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
again going forward that's a great
 
03:49:41.350 --> 03:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
question I don't know off the top of my
 
03:49:42.910 --> 03:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
head if they're running it the same way
 
03:49:45.190 --> 03:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
this time I'd have to look into it and I
 
03:49:46.628 --> 03:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
can certainly share some information
 
03:49:49.430 --> 03:49:49.440 align:start position:0%

commission um and it's been quite
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
interesting one of the things that we
 
03:50:45.628 --> 03:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
did discuss at our last meeting was the
 
03:50:47.390 --> 03:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
um are we making sure that we're doing
 
03:50:49.990 --> 03:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
everything we can to get the schools
 
03:50:53.708 --> 03:50:53.718 align:start position:0%
that haven't yet applied um and um I
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
would ask you if you just describe the
 
03:50:58.750 --> 03:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
steps that have been taken by the
 
03:51:02.548 --> 03:51:02.558 align:start position:0%
department of Ed and um the um uh office
 
03:51:06.350 --> 03:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
of Homeland Security toward that end
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
sure uh in please um sure thank you for
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
that question in 2018 the fund um was
 
03:51:14.670 --> 03:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
started that's the Inception of the fund
 
03:51:16.708 --> 03:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
and at that time there was a total of 28
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
million that went out in that uh first
 
03:51:23.030 --> 03:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
batch of um schools and if I recall um
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
it was a rolling process at that time
 
03:51:28.270 --> 03:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
and at some point in time the homeland
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
security reached out to all the school
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
districts that had not yet applied and
 
03:51:33.948 --> 03:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
kind of gave them fed them information
 
03:51:35.788 --> 03:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
to try to encourage them to apply so
 
03:51:37.150 --> 03:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
that was the first attempt to make sure
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
that everybody knew about it and then
 
03:51:41.510 --> 03:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
this last round of funding we've since
 
03:51:43.750 --> 03:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
that first batch we've had three other
 
03:51:45.548 --> 03:51:45.558 align:start position:0%
rounds of funding we call them round one
 
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
round two round three uh and um round
 
03:51:52.548 --> 03:51:52.558 align:start position:0%
three funding was based on a first in
 
03:51:56.190 --> 03:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
first out uh basis however if you had
 
03:51:58.788 --> 03:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
never received funding from if you are a
 
03:52:00.788 --> 03:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
school dist not just a school district a
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
specific school that had not received
 
03:52:05.150 --> 03:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
funding you dumped that wait list so we
 
03:52:07.190 --> 03:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
were able to fund all the schools that
 
03:52:09.628 --> 03:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
had never received funding and we left
 
03:52:12.030 --> 03:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
that um application deadline open for an
 
03:52:14.190 --> 03:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
extended period of time to make sure
 
03:52:15.750 --> 03:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
that schools could get an application
 
03:52:18.990 --> 03:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
into to fund you're welcome further
 
03:52:20.830 --> 03:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:52:23.390 --> 03:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that I think uh it
 
03:52:27.150 --> 03:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
closes um uh House Bill
 
03:52:32.628 --> 03:52:32.638 align:start position:0%

hey we've got statewide responsibilities
 
03:54:54.350 --> 03:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
we've heard about these all all um all
 
03:54:57.070 --> 03:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
day today and and it continues here as
 
03:55:00.548 --> 03:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
well so um I'm just going to take really
 
03:55:03.788 --> 03:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes to uh to introduce
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill
 
03:55:08.350 --> 03:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
1452 and uh and pass it along to some uh
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
some some people that uh that are
 
03:55:12.430 --> 03:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
Professionals in this area and are going
 
03:55:14.110 --> 03:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
to going to going to speak to the
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
importance here and and the the
 
03:55:19.470 --> 03:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative work that uh that that uh
 
03:55:22.190 --> 03:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
will hopefully be coming before us but
 
03:55:25.548 --> 03:55:25.558 align:start position:0%
um but I want to I want to just take a
 
03:55:27.430 --> 03:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
couple minutes to sort of lay the
 
03:55:32.548 --> 03:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
backdrop here um we've all seen it um uh
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
particularly over the last last few
 
03:55:36.910 --> 03:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
weeks but even the last year that
 
03:55:38.830 --> 03:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of uh storms that
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
have blown through New Hampshire and um
 
03:55:44.430 --> 03:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
and some of these storms have um have
 
03:55:46.948 --> 03:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
obviously affected you know Sea Coast
 
03:55:50.470 --> 03:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
communities but uh they've also affected
 
03:55:53.470 --> 03:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh the um the Department of Education
 
03:55:56.750 --> 03:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
and um and uh one of the storms that's
 
03:55:59.548 --> 03:55:59.558 align:start position:0%
blowing right now is affecting uh the
 
03:56:03.030 --> 03:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
education rules uh for the minimum uh
 
03:56:05.590 --> 03:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
stand ards for schools so the 306s we've
 
03:56:09.350 --> 03:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
heard about those um other storms though
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
have affected uh uh I think a more I
 
03:56:16.230 --> 03:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe more Arcane uh area of
 
03:56:20.110 --> 03:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
rules called the called the 506s if I
 
03:56:23.470 --> 03:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
have that if I have that right and um
 
03:56:29.628 --> 03:56:29.638 align:start position:0%
and the 506 rules uh go to the um um the
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
credentialing standards or the minimum
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
the standards for for um for school
 
03:56:37.350 --> 03:56:37.360 align:start position:0%

03:56:49.310 --> 03:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
with regards to the superintendent rule
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
rules have really been decimated by uh
 
03:56:54.150 --> 03:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
by some of these storms and I think
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
given the responsibilities that
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
superintendents have and there's only
 
03:56:59.548 --> 03:56:59.558 align:start position:0%
there's about a 100 superintendant
 
03:57:01.948 --> 03:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire that
 
03:57:04.628 --> 03:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
uh lead School District districts that
 
03:57:08.590 --> 03:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
that serve the needs of 165,000 students
 
03:57:12.430 --> 03:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh for 180 days uh uh days a year plus
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
um serving the community needs that uh
 
03:57:16.270 --> 03:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
that those that those school districts
 
03:57:19.110 --> 03:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
and school buildings are often used for
 
03:57:22.190 --> 03:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh so the superintendent rules in
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
U in 506 were really decimated the um
 
03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
the rules for the school business
 
03:57:32.150 --> 03:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
officers were actually washed out to see
 
03:57:33.868 --> 03:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
you don't even find can't even find them
 
03:57:37.430 --> 03:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
anymore and um and and again School
 
03:57:41.190 --> 03:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
business officers um you know I'm I'm
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
guessing that that is probably around
 
03:57:45.190 --> 03:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
the same number of school business
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
officers that there may be
 
03:57:48.708 --> 03:57:48.718 align:start position:0%
superintendents because they generally
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
work in the um in the SAU office but
 
03:57:54.150 --> 03:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
these 100 School business officers are
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing and managing
 
03:58:00.868 --> 03:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
budgets that uh that that that top out
 
03:58:03.788 --> 03:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
um you know over three and A5 billion a
 
03:58:07.628 --> 03:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
year in taxpayer money and um and to to
 
03:58:09.230 --> 03:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
think that we wouldn't have standards
 
03:58:11.390 --> 03:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
for credentialing a school business
 
03:58:14.470 --> 03:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
officer is really um uh is really you
 
03:58:17.470 --> 03:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
know quite astounding um given the the
 
03:58:19.350 --> 03:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
size and the scope of their
 
03:58:22.990 --> 03:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so what uh what
 
03:58:27.390 --> 03:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
1452 uh is is here to do um uh as
 
03:58:32.270 --> 03:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
written is to provide a vehicle for um
 
03:58:33.990 --> 03:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh for the School administrator
 
03:58:36.430 --> 03:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
Association for New Hampshire asbo the
 
03:58:38.510 --> 03:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
school business officer uh
 
03:58:41.750 --> 03:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
Administration to to lay out a statutory
 
03:58:45.150 --> 03:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
framework for um for rule professional
 
03:58:47.948 --> 03:58:47.958 align:start position:0%
rules for these very very important
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
positions that uh that that oversee the
 
03:58:54.708 --> 03:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
instruction the curriculum the safety of
 
03:58:58.830 --> 03:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
165,000 students a year and our tax
 
03:59:02.150 --> 03:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
dollars North of$ three5 billion dollars
 
03:59:04.788 --> 03:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh a year and um and make sure we're
 
03:59:07.190 --> 03:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
doing um we're doing the right thing not
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
only for our kids and our families and
 
03:59:11.070 --> 03:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
our communities but for the taxpayers
 
03:59:13.350 --> 03:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
that are funding uh these schools you
 
03:59:16.110 --> 03:59:16.120 align:start position:0%
know I really don't have any any reason
 
03:59:20.270 --> 03:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
why these storms blew in or
 
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
why some of these rules were decimated
 
03:59:25.510 --> 03:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
and others were were washed out to shore
 
03:59:29.350 --> 03:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
um the rules may have simply expired uh
 
03:59:31.350 --> 03:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
but regardless I think it's important
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire has have
 
03:59:36.190 --> 03:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
U have have competent rules in place
 
03:59:38.110 --> 03:59:38.120 align:start position:0%
that uh that really you know provide
 
03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
some backbone to these very very
 
03:59:41.948 --> 03:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
important positions so with that I'm
 
03:59:43.390 --> 03:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
happy to take some questions but I know
 
03:59:44.830 --> 03:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's some folks here that I think can
 
03:59:46.868 --> 03:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
lay some more technical detail behind
 
03:59:48.350 --> 03:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
this thank you very much are questions
 
03:59:51.628 --> 03:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
for represent luno yes thank you Mr
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
chair um for years we've had standards
 
03:59:59.430 --> 03:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
for our superintendents our principles
 
04:00:02.270 --> 04:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
our business coordinators our um and
 
04:00:04.628 --> 04:00:04.638 align:start position:0%
they're usually based on National
 
04:00:06.430 --> 04:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines that have been posted by the
 
04:00:09.708 --> 04:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
chief State School Officers
 
04:00:13.350 --> 04:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
Association how could that possibly have
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
changed so thank you for for the
 
04:00:18.150 --> 04:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
question representative Heath um I'm
 
04:00:21.750 --> 04:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I I I honestly don't know how uh
 
04:00:24.270 --> 04:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
how it changed uh I know some of these
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
changes I think were made uh were made
 
04:00:30.548 --> 04:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
very quickly by our state board um and
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and and
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
and but but I think rather than looking
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
at it as a as a um as a problem which it
 
04:00:43.788 --> 04:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
is a problem um if we can look at it as
 
04:00:47.910 --> 04:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to to uh take a look at
 
04:00:50.390 --> 04:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
um at the rules that were in place what
 
04:00:52.270 --> 04:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
sort of updates could be made to those
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
rules based on best practices based on
 
04:00:56.670 --> 04:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
what uh what we're seeing in other areas
 
04:00:58.230 --> 04:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
across the country and based on what our
 
04:01:00.270 --> 04:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
needs are in New Hampshire uh I think
 
04:01:03.310 --> 04:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
we've got a good opportunity here and um
 
04:01:05.628 --> 04:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
and again you know I'm not the expert in
 
04:01:08.270 --> 04:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
this area I know there are some on this
 
04:01:11.310 --> 04:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
this committee who are experts um in
 
04:01:13.430 --> 04:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
this but uh but we do have a lot of
 
04:01:15.350 --> 04:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
expertise throughout the state as well
 
04:01:18.030 --> 04:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
that I think can help us um uh put uh
 
04:01:21.868 --> 04:01:21.878 align:start position:0%
put strong robust um uh rules um uh for
 
04:01:23.788 --> 04:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
our you know kids families communities
 
04:01:23.798 --> 04:01:24.788 align:start position:0%
our you know kids families communities
and

04:01:24.788 --> 04:01:24.798 align:start position:0%

specific line and I need a little bit of
 
04:01:38.110 --> 04:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
clarification so down on item F number
 
04:01:41.548 --> 04:01:41.558 align:start position:0%

okay the
 
04:01:50.070 --> 04:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
page oh I'm I'm looking at the whole
 
04:01:53.788 --> 04:01:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.548 --> 04:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.788 --> 04:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
yeah um f F1 it starts exerting
 
04:02:02.798 --> 04:02:07.548 align:start position:0%
yeah um f F1 it starts exerting
professional

04:02:07.548 --> 04:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.190 --> 04:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
influence it's page four L to page four
 
04:02:15.070 --> 04:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
at the top thank you for that um so
 
04:02:16.470 --> 04:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
under the qualifications for
 
04:02:18.190 --> 04:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent it says exerting
 
04:02:20.350 --> 04:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
professional influence improving the
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
broader political social economic legal
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
and cultural context of education for
 
04:02:28.590 --> 04:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
all students and families through active
 
04:02:30.070 --> 04:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
participation in the local community and
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the larger education policy environment
 
04:02:33.430 --> 04:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
can you give me an example example of
 
04:02:36.030 --> 04:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
what what is intended by especially the
 
04:02:38.390 --> 04:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
political education of
 
04:02:40.948 --> 04:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
students I'm still trying to find it I'm
 
04:02:43.150 --> 04:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing it on page three at the
 
04:02:46.788 --> 04:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
bottom page four line three page four
 
04:02:49.548 --> 04:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
line oh oh all right so the f starts
 
04:02:54.910 --> 04:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:58.628 --> 04:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
um so again I there there's no intent by
 
04:03:01.430 --> 04:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
the the the language that's here uh it
 
04:03:04.190 --> 04:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
was taken from from some national uh
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
positions so I I I'm I'm really really
 
04:03:10.788 --> 04:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
Lo using this bill as a placeholder for
 
04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
collaborative work with the with the
 
04:03:15.190 --> 04:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
professional associations uh in the
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:20.708 --> 04:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
question yes represent
 
04:03:22.868 --> 04:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm not sure if
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
this applies to what your presentation
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
is or to um someone else is going to
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
testify but are you telling me that
 
04:03:33.310 --> 04:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
there was
 
04:03:36.548 --> 04:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
such a sore change or a storm as you
 
04:03:40.390 --> 04:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
described that the current 302 uh rule
 
04:03:42.670 --> 04:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
is not being
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
followed the 302 which is a duties of
 
04:03:48.470 --> 04:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
school superintendent identify Ed rules
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know about that I'm I'm
 
04:03:53.548 --> 04:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
talking about the 506 rules for
 
04:03:57.470 --> 04:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
superintendant I think three the the 302
 
04:04:00.430 --> 04:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
right um and and I did take a look that
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
that lists a very very long list of
 
04:04:07.390 --> 04:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh that superintendent
 
04:04:09.430 --> 04:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
have in the management and oversight of
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
our school districts I I I I think the
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
original rules would reflect upon that
 
04:04:20.190 --> 04:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the that people who
 
04:04:22.868 --> 04:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
were were applying to be superintendant
 
04:04:25.350 --> 04:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
had the qualifications to be able to
 
04:04:28.270 --> 04:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
exercise that degree of management and
 
04:04:32.190 --> 04:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
and oversight but that the the rules
 
04:04:34.350 --> 04:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to their qualifications
 
04:04:37.510 --> 04:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
have changed as such so that it's
 
04:04:41.110 --> 04:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
now not
 
04:04:45.430 --> 04:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
um not clear as to as to whether whether
 
04:04:47.868 --> 04:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
somebody applying to be a superintendent
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
would actually have the um the skills
 
04:04:52.670 --> 04:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
and experience uh and background
 
04:04:55.788 --> 04:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
qualifications to be able to provide uh
 
04:04:57.948 --> 04:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to um exercise their duties

04:05:04.150 --> 04:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
about credentialing I am that that's the
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
506 rules I haven't heard that term I
 
04:05:09.628 --> 04:05:09.638 align:start position:0%

Public School

Employees
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
um have
 
04:05:34.628 --> 04:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
there been
 
04:05:37.270 --> 04:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
identified uh problems with people in
 
04:05:40.868 --> 04:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
the field due to maybe a change in the
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
requirements um in the 506s is that why
 
04:05:46.590 --> 04:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
this is coming forward now so thank you
 
04:05:48.430 --> 04:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
very uh very much for the question
 
04:05:51.628 --> 04:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli um I I the the
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
as as I understand it the changes were
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
made uh fairly recently certainly within
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
the last year and um and specifically I
 
04:06:02.628 --> 04:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
recall being at the state board meeting
 
04:06:04.990 --> 04:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
where the uh where where the elimination
 
04:06:07.548 --> 04:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
of the school business officer rules
 
04:06:09.350 --> 04:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
were uh were changed I believe
 
04:06:12.150 --> 04:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding that um there were there were
 
04:06:14.190 --> 04:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
significant changes made to the the
 
04:06:15.430 --> 04:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
rules for
 
04:06:19.150 --> 04:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
superintendent and um and so I'm I'm not
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
aware of of what sort of um impact those
 
04:06:28.470 --> 04:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
rule changes have had on the 100 or so
 
04:06:30.750 --> 04:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent and 100 or so School
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
business officers uh
 
04:06:34.990 --> 04:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
that that are currently employed uh
 
04:06:37.628 --> 04:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
across our state but but should this go
 
04:06:41.190 --> 04:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
on much longer and and uh we heard
 
04:06:44.708 --> 04:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
earlier today that um that turnover
 
04:06:44.718 --> 04:06:45.708 align:start position:0%
earlier today that um that turnover
among

04:06:45.708 --> 04:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
among
 
04:06:48.708 --> 04:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
superintendant um can be fairly high
 
04:06:51.430 --> 04:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
that we may start to see some effects
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
from lowering these standards um for for
 
04:06:57.310 --> 04:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
credentialing in these senior leadership
 
04:07:00.350 --> 04:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
positions yes
 
04:07:03.628 --> 04:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
um would the same apply for principles
 
04:07:06.390 --> 04:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
because that's also listed as one of the
 
04:07:08.470 --> 04:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility there there's there there
 
04:07:12.190 --> 04:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
are um um there there is a standard in
 
04:07:13.948 --> 04:07:13.958 align:start position:0%
place for principles there's I think a
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
standard in place for um for uh you know
 
04:07:21.230 --> 04:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
um um different administrators uh in
 
04:07:23.310 --> 04:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
there I'm not aware to what extent those
 
04:07:26.430 --> 04:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
rules may have changed uh others to
 
04:07:28.830 --> 04:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
speak after may have um additional
 
04:07:31.548 --> 04:07:31.558 align:start position:0%
information but this bill really focuses
 
04:07:33.948 --> 04:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
specifically on
 
04:07:38.430 --> 04:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
on you know two of the and I don't want
 
04:07:40.470 --> 04:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
to say most important everybody's got a
 
04:07:43.628 --> 04:07:43.638 align:start position:0%
role in a in a public school district um
 
04:07:46.310 --> 04:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if you're if you're a
 
04:07:48.590 --> 04:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
parent you're a student you know your
 
04:07:50.628 --> 04:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
teachers are important your principes
 
04:07:53.230 --> 04:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
are important um when you when you show
 
04:07:54.868 --> 04:07:54.878 align:start position:0%
up at a school district meeting and vote
 
04:07:57.548 --> 04:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
on budget budgets your school board is
 
04:07:59.510 --> 04:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
there the superintendent is there the
 
04:08:01.350 --> 04:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
business officer is there when you're at
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
a budget committee meeting I think we
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
had a a bill the other day about
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal budget committees the business
 
04:08:11.430 --> 04:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
officer is there and and for um you know
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
for 12 years presenting School budgets
 
04:08:16.430 --> 04:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
and going through and basically um you
 
04:08:18.628 --> 04:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
know shepherding our budget process
 
04:08:20.708 --> 04:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
through our Municipal budget committee
 
04:08:20.718 --> 04:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
through our Municipal budget committee
that

04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:08:24.030 --> 04:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
trust that members of the community who
 
04:08:25.350 --> 04:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
serve whether they're serving on a
 
04:08:27.470 --> 04:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
school board or serving on a municipal
 
04:08:29.910 --> 04:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee have with the school
 
04:08:33.548 --> 04:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
business officer is incredible it is so
 
04:08:36.070 --> 04:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
important and um and they have to be
 
04:08:37.628 --> 04:08:37.638 align:start position:0%
able to believe what they're hearing
 
04:08:40.470 --> 04:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
particularly in a very very complicated
 
04:08:42.868 --> 04:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
um School budgets aren't easy they're
 
04:08:47.788 --> 04:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
not easy and um and and and to leave to
 
04:08:50.868 --> 04:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
leave the professional qualifications up
 
04:08:54.150 --> 04:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
in the air to be all right um we're
 
04:08:56.390 --> 04:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not going to set a hard
 
04:08:58.910 --> 04:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
deck as to what your qualifications need
 
04:09:00.470 --> 04:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
to be what your experience and
 
04:09:02.750 --> 04:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
background needs to be
 
04:09:05.390 --> 04:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
then then you know I I would be
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're um we're setting
 
04:09:10.150 --> 04:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves up for um for challenges down
 
04:09:11.868 --> 04:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
the road and now is the opportunity
 
04:09:13.708 --> 04:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
where we can address
 
04:09:15.868 --> 04:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
it are there further questions for
 
04:09:18.628 --> 04:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
represent represent dry thank you Mr
 
04:09:19.868 --> 04:09:19.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:09:23.430 --> 04:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
question so I see a big disconnect
 
04:09:25.708 --> 04:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
between the two or three lines in here
 
04:09:27.150 --> 04:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
that say you need to make rules about
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for these offices and
 
04:09:32.628 --> 04:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
the minutia that's five pages long
 
04:09:35.390 --> 04:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
here this looks to me more like rules
 
04:09:40.110 --> 04:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
than um than than um enabling you know
 
04:09:42.070 --> 04:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
is there some kind of medium that you
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
can can make uh rather than putting this
 
04:09:46.990 --> 04:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
in the statute ABS absolutely thank you
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
very much for the for the question uh
 
04:09:52.110 --> 04:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
representative dry um I I would I would
 
04:09:56.430 --> 04:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely suggest that that we we we go
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
to a to what what I would call more of a
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
stat statutory framework for the rules
 
04:10:04.190 --> 04:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
making sure that the that the statute
 
04:10:06.270 --> 04:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
contains all of the required elements
 
04:10:08.548 --> 04:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
that would we would be looking for in
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
rule making and then leave it to the
 
04:10:13.868 --> 04:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
department to um to you know flesh out
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
the um and the department and the board
 
04:10:20.708 --> 04:10:20.718 align:start position:0%
and the and and jel car to um uh to
 
04:10:23.390 --> 04:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
flush out the uh the rest of those rules
 
04:10:26.390 --> 04:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
but uh where we've seen rules either
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
decimated or or completely obliterated
 
04:10:32.670 --> 04:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
that um that that maybe we need to have
 
04:10:36.548 --> 04:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
something more in statute than was there
 
04:10:38.470 --> 04:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
than is either there now or was there
 
04:10:42.030 --> 04:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
before uh to provide the department with
 
04:10:45.430 --> 04:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
better guidance as to what we intend as
 
04:10:49.390 --> 04:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
a legislature to uh to to you know want
 
04:10:53.070 --> 04:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
to see to to you know the most um you
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
know senior leaders in our um in our
 
04:10:55.600 --> 04:10:57.670 align:start position:0%
know senior leaders in our um in our
school

04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:10:59.868 --> 04:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
districts uh I have a question for are
 
04:11:02.470 --> 04:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
you aware that there is an exemption I
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
see exception to this for small school
 
04:11:08.628 --> 04:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
districts where a principal can take on
 
04:11:10.510 --> 04:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
this leadership responsibility as an
 
04:11:13.430 --> 04:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
administrator yeah I I am aware of that
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh 194 C3 yeah and and I'm I'm I'm aware
 
04:11:19.230 --> 04:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
of it I'm not aware of all of the
 
04:11:21.230 --> 04:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
functional elements of that I don't know
 
04:11:24.390 --> 04:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
if it's open-ended can go on forever um
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
I I think there was even a um what's the
 
04:11:30.310 --> 04:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
term is it alt or something alter
 
04:11:32.948 --> 04:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
alternative yeah yeah but but something
 
04:11:34.750 --> 04:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
for superintendant that didn't meet all
 
04:11:36.430 --> 04:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
the qualifications but were working
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
towards those qualifications that they
 
04:11:41.230 --> 04:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
could serve as superintendent and and
 
04:11:43.708 --> 04:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to trying to you know say
 
04:11:45.548 --> 04:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
that we can't do that because I think
 
04:11:47.390 --> 04:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
there there there's there's clearly
 
04:11:51.190 --> 04:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
value in making sure that um that that
 
04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
um that a school board can hire a
 
04:11:55.470 --> 04:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent or School business
 
04:11:57.708 --> 04:11:57.718 align:start position:0%
officer that they feel can can meet
 
04:12:01.510 --> 04:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
their needs but subject to to at at
 
04:12:06.470 --> 04:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
least a a um uh set of qualifications
 
04:12:09.470 --> 04:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
and criteria for credentialing that uh
 
04:12:11.990 --> 04:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that protects the um the interest the
 
04:12:15.150 --> 04:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
safety uh of the students of the the
 
04:12:16.628 --> 04:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
visitors of the parents of the
 
04:12:18.750 --> 04:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
communities that use those buildings
 
04:12:20.510 --> 04:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
facilities we talk about facilities a
 
04:12:23.150 --> 04:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
lot very important thing superintendant
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
have those responsibilities School
 
04:12:26.868 --> 04:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
business officers have those
 
04:12:29.948 --> 04:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities too and that um and
 
04:12:32.708 --> 04:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
that that we make sure that um that our
 
04:12:35.270 --> 04:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
our senior leaders have the um have the
 
04:12:39.150 --> 04:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
qualifications and capability to um U to
 
04:12:42.110 --> 04:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
exercise their responsibility so we what
 
04:12:44.310 --> 04:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to drive home is that do we
 
04:12:46.310 --> 04:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
need to do this through statute or is it
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
best done through 506 because I'm
 
04:12:50.350 --> 04:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the statute and I explored
 
04:12:53.628 --> 04:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
this too I have a master's program and
 
04:12:56.190 --> 04:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
and uh this says the superintendent of a
 
04:12:58.270 --> 04:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
single School District may qualify
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
alternative certification as principal
 
04:13:02.110 --> 04:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
instruction leader who has undergone a
 
04:13:04.390 --> 04:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
rigorous process that ensures that
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
individual has gained necessary
 
04:13:08.590 --> 04:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
competency skills and knowledge required
 
04:13:10.628 --> 04:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
for certification in an ad
 
04:13:13.030 --> 04:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
administrative role as determined by the
 
04:13:15.230 --> 04:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so the
 
04:13:17.390 --> 04:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
department working with the board then
 
04:13:22.150 --> 04:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
is the responsible agent agency to to
 
04:13:24.628 --> 04:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
Define this broad language which we've
 
04:13:26.788 --> 04:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
given and the Masters plus 5 years
 
04:13:29.110 --> 04:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
experience is what they're talking about
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
yeah except thank you for the uh for the
 
04:13:33.230 --> 04:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
clarification on that except that's not
 
04:13:35.270 --> 04:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
what the State Board of Education told
 
04:13:37.868 --> 04:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
me when U uh when I was there and
 
04:13:41.230 --> 04:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
testifying on the U on the the the wipe
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
out of the school business officer um
 
04:13:45.430 --> 04:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications they said if you want to
 
04:13:47.868 --> 04:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
see qualifications in rules then you
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
better enact some law that's what I was
 
04:13:53.390 --> 04:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
told okay thank
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
you ref
 
04:13:59.230 --> 04:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
Santana thank you so just as a followup
 
04:14:03.270 --> 04:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
to that so is your proposal to make the
 
04:14:06.510 --> 04:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
clear intent of a statute to
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
underly what the rules then are drawn up
 
04:14:12.590 --> 04:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
on if that's thank you very much
 
04:14:14.390 --> 04:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner for the question I
 
04:14:16.430 --> 04:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
believe all rules have to be able to
 
04:14:20.788 --> 04:14:20.798 align:start position:0%
lean on on statute um at least I think
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we've been told that there
 
04:14:25.430 --> 04:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be a statutory underpinning for
 
04:14:29.430 --> 04:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
for administrative rules um uh I it it
 
04:14:32.430 --> 04:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear that that what what
 
04:14:36.868 --> 04:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
may be in statute now was sufficient to
 
04:14:40.030 --> 04:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
um to to was a sufficient underpinning
 
04:14:43.190 --> 04:14:43.200 align:start position:0%
maybe for the um the rules that have
 
04:14:47.270 --> 04:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
been wiped out um and uh and the intent
 
04:14:50.868 --> 04:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
here is is to provide that statutory
 
04:14:54.548 --> 04:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
underpinning I hope that that that it's
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
not up to the legislature to to get down
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know into the the really the
 
04:15:04.350 --> 04:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
detailed professional levels um of here
 
04:15:06.868 --> 04:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
but of of of what would be required
 
04:15:09.310 --> 04:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
because I think that's beyond our I I
 
04:15:10.948 --> 04:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
think that's beyond what what we're
 
04:15:14.430 --> 04:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
expected to do and I don't think this NE
 
04:15:16.310 --> 04:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily needs to be you know a
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
20page bill but I think it needs to be
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
sufficiently clear so that the state
 
04:15:23.868 --> 04:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
board and the commissioner can uh can
 
04:15:27.788 --> 04:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
develop rules and um and and revise
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
those rules as necessary to stay within
 
04:15:33.150 --> 04:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
the um the the
 
04:15:36.628 --> 04:15:36.638 align:start position:0%
statutory U uh framework that uh that we
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
would provide and you're putting this
 
04:15:41.708 --> 04:15:41.718 align:start position:0%
legislation together the proposed the
 
04:15:45.628 --> 04:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
bill did you ask the question that every
 
04:15:48.270 --> 04:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
10 years rules have to be looked
 
04:15:52.590 --> 04:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
at and by that agency and brought before
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
Jael car have you asked the question why
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
we meaning Jael car then have not
 
04:16:02.110 --> 04:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
modified the 506 or
 
04:16:03.750 --> 04:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
if you're saying that some of this is
 
04:16:05.948 --> 04:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
not there anymore it's been deleted why
 
04:16:08.670 --> 04:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
was it deleted by and Allowed by Jael
 
04:16:11.230 --> 04:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
car us why we do that yeah yeah that's a
 
04:16:13.390 --> 04:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
that's a great question when when I was
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
at the State Board I was told if you
 
04:16:18.270 --> 04:16:18.280 align:start position:0%
want any of this to remain then you you
 
04:16:21.670 --> 04:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
should put it in law and so I take that
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
meaning to mean that we didn't have
 
04:16:26.868 --> 04:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
enough statutory framework in place in
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
order to hold on to uh to the rules that
 
04:16:31.788 --> 04:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
they were they were significant L
 
04:16:35.270 --> 04:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
reducing or um or you know eliminating
 
04:16:38.110 --> 04:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
completely so so I I wish I had a better
 
04:16:41.470 --> 04:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
answer for you and others um um the um
 
04:16:43.110 --> 04:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
School administrator Association I
 
04:16:46.628 --> 04:16:46.638 align:start position:0%
believe is is signed up to to speak and
 
04:16:49.150 --> 04:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
um and they may have more clarity on
 
04:16:51.868 --> 04:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
that thank you further
 
04:16:55.190 --> 04:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much oh you
 
04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
have one hand up I didn't see it yes
 
04:16:59.070 --> 04:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just I just had one
 
04:17:00.750 --> 04:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
followup because you were talking about
 
04:17:02.470 --> 04:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
the need to provide further Frameworks
 
04:17:05.708 --> 04:17:05.718 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education to guide
 
04:17:08.310 --> 04:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
them a little more firmly I'm going to
 
04:17:10.628 --> 04:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
say something surprising I'm in total
 
04:17:12.150 --> 04:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
agreement with
 
04:17:15.230 --> 04:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
that however I some of the specifics
 
04:17:17.190 --> 04:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
make me a little more Curious so
 
04:17:19.548 --> 04:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
actually I brought up one line I want to
 
04:17:21.548 --> 04:17:21.558 align:start position:0%
look at the next one which is
 
04:17:24.350 --> 04:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
F2 where again we're talking about the
 
04:17:26.948 --> 04:17:26.958 align:start position:0%
specific requirements for a um
 
04:17:29.390 --> 04:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent to be contributing to the
 
04:17:31.750 --> 04:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
educational policy and political uh
 
04:17:33.750 --> 04:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
policy environment and political support
 
04:17:37.110 --> 04:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
for excellence and equity in education
 
04:17:38.990 --> 04:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
striving to uphold an influence
 
04:17:41.470 --> 04:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
influence federal state and local laws
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
policies and regulations statut and
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements and effectively
 
04:17:47.150 --> 04:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
communicating with key decision makers
 
04:17:48.390 --> 04:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
in the community and in broader
 
04:17:51.868 --> 04:17:51.878 align:start position:0%
political context to support student
 
04:17:54.708 --> 04:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
learning that sounds like there is an
 
04:17:57.948 --> 04:17:57.958 align:start position:0%
explicitly political component to this
 
04:17:59.788 --> 04:17:59.798 align:start position:0%
job description
 
04:18:03.470 --> 04:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
that seems to be something more akin to
 
04:18:04.548 --> 04:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
what you would expect an elected
 
04:18:06.070 --> 04:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
official to undertake can you speak to
 
04:18:09.788 --> 04:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
that sure um I again th this is example
 
04:18:12.190 --> 04:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
framework in here and not and not what
 
04:18:14.948 --> 04:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
um uh but that being said what you just
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
read I think is an example of what we
 
04:18:20.470 --> 04:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
see um every day when we're uh when
 
04:18:24.548 --> 04:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
we're in here with hearings there are um
 
04:18:27.670 --> 04:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh administrators from various districts
 
04:18:30.270 --> 04:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
will come in and testify there will be
 
04:18:32.868 --> 04:18:32.878 align:start position:0%
administrators from from uh different
 
04:18:35.230 --> 04:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
executive part departments outside of
 
04:18:37.430 --> 04:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
school districts that will come in and
 
04:18:40.868 --> 04:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
testify and those are political they are
 
04:18:43.310 --> 04:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
performing political work there not
 
04:18:46.430 --> 04:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
partisan work it's not partisan it's
 
04:18:48.590 --> 04:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
political though uh we're clearly a
 
04:18:51.670 --> 04:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
political body here and we rely on
 
04:18:55.070 --> 04:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
expertise from uh from people who who
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
are in the field and um and and and
 
04:19:00.868 --> 04:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
understand these areas you know I dare
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
say maybe better than we do and um and
 
04:19:07.310 --> 04:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
being able to to take that testimony uh
 
04:19:09.030 --> 04:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
is uh is important and I think that's
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
all that that paragraph is um is gaming
 
04:19:15.070 --> 04:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
to further questions thank you very much
 
04:19:16.510 --> 04:19:16.520 align:start position:0%

some of the questions that have come out
 
04:19:53.708 --> 04:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
if you give me leave to do that and one
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying thing before we start I am
 
04:19:58.990 --> 04:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
not married to that woman over there she
 
04:20:01.830 --> 04:20:01.840 align:start position:0%

04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh my former my brother Neil who passed
 
04:20:06.868 --> 04:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
away I bet you were wishing you were
 
04:20:09.150 --> 04:20:09.160 align:start position:0%

today which says I love New Hampshire
 
04:20:21.310 --> 04:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
public education and we got those as
 
04:20:24.270 --> 04:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
superintendents um just to talk about
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
and I've been in it for a long time I
 
04:20:28.948 --> 04:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
started um over with representative dry
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
over in Hanover I was principal of a
 
04:20:33.548 --> 04:20:33.558 align:start position:0%

04:20:39.390 --> 04:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
and went into public school and I'm an
 
04:20:41.868 --> 04:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
un batched supporter of public school I
 
04:20:44.390 --> 04:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
just am I just it it has happened I
 
04:20:47.390 --> 04:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
understand the politics but um so I
 
04:20:49.230 --> 04:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
didn't wear the T-shirt CU I also got a
 
04:20:50.510 --> 04:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
haircut believe it or not I got a
 
04:20:52.990 --> 04:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
haircut just before com in here so yeah
 
04:20:56.110 --> 04:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
pretty long uh because I I I do respect
 
04:20:57.948 --> 04:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
this this group and I I do thank you
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time here represent lad
 
04:21:01.150 --> 04:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your leadership it'll be
 
04:21:02.390 --> 04:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
a couple things I'm going to touch on
 
04:21:06.030 --> 04:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
for you but let me just start with this
 
04:21:08.230 --> 04:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
money is essential we won't talk about
 
04:21:10.470 --> 04:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
that today but it's common the lawsuits
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
comell lawsuit Rand lawsuit it's coming
 
04:21:15.390 --> 04:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
money is essential I mean started up in
 
04:21:19.030 --> 04:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
sau36 and then I came down to B because
 
04:21:20.868 --> 04:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
what could I do in the school system if
 
04:21:22.990 --> 04:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
the first question wasn't how do we pay
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
for it if the first question was what
 
04:21:26.708 --> 04:21:26.718 align:start position:0%
should we do but money is essential
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that second later on
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
leadership is absolutely essential and
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
there are vared situations in New
 
04:21:37.510 --> 04:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean I started an sau36
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District Seven towns
 
04:21:42.030 --> 04:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
all to coming together into one board I
 
04:21:43.948 --> 04:21:43.958 align:start position:0%
went down to Bose single district and
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
then we lured Dunbarton in so I became a
 
04:21:48.708 --> 04:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
multi-district sa over there and now I
 
04:21:51.470 --> 04:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
am semi-retired I'm in
 
04:21:53.868 --> 04:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
Grandam which is on the Western frontier
 
04:21:56.270 --> 04:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
of the state I'm two days a week
 
04:21:56.280 --> 04:21:57.470 align:start position:0%
of the state I'm two days a week
part-time

04:21:57.470 --> 04:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
04:22:02.470 --> 04:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
interim and those are all very different
 
04:22:05.230 --> 04:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
situations for educational leadership
 
04:22:06.868 --> 04:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to write a rule we're
 
04:22:08.430 --> 04:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
trying to write a bill that covers all
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
of those and it's very difficult so
 
04:22:11.470 --> 04:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's the first thing you got to
 
04:22:13.590 --> 04:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
remember these situations are all
 
04:22:15.390 --> 04:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
different the second thing you got to
 
04:22:17.390 --> 04:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
remember is we're a state of local
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
control and school
 
04:22:21.310 --> 04:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
boards um I remember when Frank first
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
came on he was I'm sorry commissioner El
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
first came on he was talking to me about
 
04:22:27.430 --> 04:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know well how can I get the
 
04:22:29.430 --> 04:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
superintendant to do what I want and I
 
04:22:31.948 --> 04:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
said you can't
 
04:22:33.948 --> 04:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
it it's just not it used to be that the
 
04:22:35.430 --> 04:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education signed the
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck and evaluated and now I'm
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
evaluated by my local school board I'm
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
basically paid by my local school board
 
04:22:45.708 --> 04:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect Barrett uh
 
04:22:47.708 --> 04:22:47.718 align:start position:0%
School boards are amateur
 
04:22:49.548 --> 04:22:49.558 align:start position:0%
organizations there there's no
 
04:22:50.868 --> 04:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
requirement to be a Schoolboard member
 
04:22:52.150 --> 04:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
except for you're a voter in town you
 
04:22:54.430 --> 04:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
get elected and a lot of good people get
 
04:22:55.830 --> 04:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
elected to boards and they have great
 
04:22:57.990 --> 04:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
ideas but they're amateurs in the sense
 
04:22:59.070 --> 04:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't understand the
 
04:23:00.470 --> 04:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
professional environment they don't
 
04:23:02.910 --> 04:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
understand everything that has to happen
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent Bas are professionals
 
04:23:08.390 --> 04:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely there's a requirement in both
 
04:23:11.190 --> 04:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent and ba certification that
 
04:23:13.310 --> 04:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
you get a college
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
degree I'm not sure how useful that is
 
04:23:18.030 --> 04:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
in my actual day-to-day job but it does
 
04:23:20.270 --> 04:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
give me exposure to Theory it does give
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
me exposure to larger ideas of Education
 
04:23:26.510 --> 04:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and so forth but the real day-to-day
 
04:23:28.708 --> 04:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
job I can only learn from other
 
04:23:29.948 --> 04:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
superintendents and business
 
04:23:31.948 --> 04:23:31.958 align:start position:0%
administrators especially in New
 
04:23:35.190 --> 04:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it is so unique so you
 
04:23:38.830 --> 04:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
got nhsaa and you got asbo Mark's here
 
04:23:40.948 --> 04:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
he's from nhsa we don't have an ASO
 
04:23:40.958 --> 04:23:44.350 align:start position:0%
he's from nhsa we don't have an ASO
representative

04:23:44.350 --> 04:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.470 --> 04:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
but Dr mlan sorry um and they're the
 
04:23:50.070 --> 04:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
ones who provide most for professional
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
development they're the ones who help us
 
04:23:53.110 --> 04:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
interpret they're the ones who help us
 
04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
build the field and the very practical
 
04:23:58.270 --> 04:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
application more so with school business
 
04:24:00.150 --> 04:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
administrators you have asbo and they
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
work together these organizations they
 
04:24:04.868 --> 04:24:04.878 align:start position:0%
meet they talk they deal with the laws
 
04:24:06.510 --> 04:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
that come up from you we deal with the
 
04:24:07.750 --> 04:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
stuff that comes down from the State
 
04:24:10.548 --> 04:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and we talk about how
 
04:24:12.628 --> 04:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
can we best implement this and how can
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
we go forward so education
 
04:24:17.868 --> 04:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
Administration it is about Theory and
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's about very practical application um
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it's a craft you know it's a little
 
04:24:25.948 --> 04:24:25.958 align:start position:0%
bit of Art and Science and so forth but
 
04:24:28.270 --> 04:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
we are professionals and we are
 
04:24:30.868 --> 04:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes the only Professionals in the
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
District who are paying attention to
 
04:24:34.150 --> 04:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
these things now one of the things you
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
need in order to have successful um
 
04:24:39.230 --> 04:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
school is long-term stable
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
Administration and you have a turnover
 
04:24:43.310 --> 04:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
problem in your school leaders it's a
 
04:24:45.548 --> 04:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
hard job it's a tough job you know the
 
04:24:47.910 --> 04:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
joke is it's a three-year cycle first
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
year you get to know them the second
 
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
year you try to implement some stuff and
 
04:24:53.350 --> 04:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
the third year you're updating your
 
04:24:54.868 --> 04:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
resume and you're out looking for a new
 
04:24:57.788 --> 04:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
Jump but there's a churn and and and
 
04:24:59.788 --> 04:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
that doesn't do our Public Schools any
 
04:24:59.798 --> 04:25:02.270 align:start position:0%
that doesn't do our Public Schools any
good

04:25:02.270 --> 04:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:25:05.868 --> 04:25:05.878 align:start position:0%
okay the first thing in the first item
 
04:25:07.948 --> 04:25:07.958 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:25:11.788 --> 04:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
um rules see this should be in rules it
 
04:25:12.868 --> 04:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
really should be you're right you
 
04:25:14.070 --> 04:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be dealing with this at the
 
04:25:15.548 --> 04:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
legislative body this should be in your
 
04:25:17.868 --> 04:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rules and the
 
04:25:19.548 --> 04:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
things that were stripped the the tie
 
04:25:20.948 --> 04:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
that he's talking about happened in
 
04:25:23.788 --> 04:25:23.798 align:start position:0%
those 10 years revision and one of the
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
thing um the first thing that that
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
starts is
 
04:25:33.708 --> 04:25:33.718 align:start position:0%
Vision an education leader has
 
04:25:37.350 --> 04:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
to build a vision and Muriel reminded me
 
04:25:39.390 --> 04:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
of this a couple sorry representative
 
04:25:40.990 --> 04:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
Hall reminded me of this she said when
 
04:25:42.628 --> 04:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
you first interviewed a Bo you came down
 
04:25:44.830 --> 04:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
and said it's not my vision it's our
 
04:25:48.510 --> 04:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
vision and that p a public educational
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
leader has to go in the community and
 
04:25:53.628 --> 04:25:53.638 align:start position:0%
respect all in the community and bring
 
04:25:55.628 --> 04:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
that Community together and create a
 
04:25:58.230 --> 04:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
vision create a plan create a rallying
 
04:26:00.310 --> 04:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
point so that the community can come
 
04:26:00.320 --> 04:26:01.190 align:start position:0%
point so that the community can come
together

04:26:01.190 --> 04:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
and and rally around their schools pay
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
for their schools support their schools
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
and do that that that's number one and
 
04:26:10.470 --> 04:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's so difficult because we have
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
divided communities we just went through
 
04:26:14.788 --> 04:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
an election you know that that it just
 
04:26:17.190 --> 04:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
split look at your body you're split 550
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
and it's partisan there's divided
 
04:26:20.948 --> 04:26:20.958 align:start position:0%
communities and it is hard to go in a
 
04:26:23.310 --> 04:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
community and bring everyone into the
 
04:26:25.310 --> 04:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
table everyone gets a seat that seat on
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten rug and say okay we're
 
04:26:28.470 --> 04:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to come together and we're going
 
04:26:30.190 --> 04:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
to do in a very respectful way we're
 
04:26:31.230 --> 04:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
going to talk talk to each other we're
 
04:26:32.470 --> 04:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
going to solve problems we're going to
 
04:26:34.670 --> 04:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
decide what our vision is for our Public
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
School in this community and each one's
 
04:26:39.030 --> 04:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
different what I'm doing in Grand them
 
04:26:41.150 --> 04:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
was different what I do in 36 what I did
 
04:26:44.548 --> 04:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
in v and and it's hard so what you do is
 
04:26:47.548 --> 04:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
you focus on student a achievement for
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
all Al for everybody and what tried to
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
get stripped out of the uh
 
04:26:55.470 --> 04:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent and I don't know if it's
 
04:26:57.708 --> 04:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
back in but when we were talking about
 
04:26:59.788 --> 04:26:59.798 align:start position:0%
re redoing the superintendent rules the
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
500 you're talking about was the concept
 
04:27:02.080 --> 04:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
500 you're talking about was the concept
of

04:27:03.190 --> 04:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:06.230 --> 04:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
equity number one an educational leader
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
has to be committed to equity why
 
04:27:12.030 --> 04:27:12.040 align:start position:0%
because we educate all in the public
 
04:27:14.310 --> 04:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
school and so you have to be committed
 
04:27:16.590 --> 04:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
to having all come in and making sure
 
04:27:18.190 --> 04:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
you are meeting the needs of all that's
 
04:27:20.070 --> 04:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
equity and that was being stripped from
 
04:27:22.868 --> 04:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
the rules and now in the in the bill
 
04:27:25.110 --> 04:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
that I read that's number one build a
 
04:27:28.230 --> 04:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
vision that has equity and that you're
 
04:27:30.230 --> 04:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
educating all and you're educating to
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
them to high
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
standards um and you know when I in B
 
04:27:36.990 --> 04:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
the proudest thing it was a mission
 
04:27:38.470 --> 04:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
statement the first thing was care for
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
each person every day focus on the
 
04:27:43.948 --> 04:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
individual and just care for them what
 
04:27:46.390 --> 04:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
what do they need they need eat lunch we
 
04:27:48.150 --> 04:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
get lunch you need some clothing we give
 
04:27:50.510 --> 04:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
clothing you need some emotional needs
 
04:27:52.270 --> 04:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
met because you can't learn yeah we're
 
04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to work on that too and we're also
 
04:27:56.030 --> 04:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to teach you teach you to
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
read write Cipher and all those other
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
things because we focus on learning
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's the major thing that we should do
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
but we do it by looking at individuals
 
04:28:08.868 --> 04:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
and because we are committed to equity
 
04:28:10.868 --> 04:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
what is it that each student needs to be
 
04:28:12.430 --> 04:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
the best person they can be and
 
04:28:13.750 --> 04:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
contribute to our
 
04:28:16.230 --> 04:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
society so in there you've got a bunch
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
of areas so let me talk about those
 
04:28:20.270 --> 04:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
areas what a superintendent is totally
 
04:28:22.310 --> 04:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for and usually who does
 
04:28:25.230 --> 04:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
them finances operations human resource
 
04:28:27.390 --> 04:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation facilities Food Service
 
04:28:30.628 --> 04:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
risk management that's usually your ba
 
04:28:32.948 --> 04:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
that's the financial side of the house
 
04:28:32.958 --> 04:28:33.590 align:start position:0%
that's the financial side of the house
you

04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:28:35.788 --> 04:28:35.798 align:start position:0%
know how we going to pay for things how
 
04:28:38.110 --> 04:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
do we pay for things operations how do
 
04:28:39.350 --> 04:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
we run things how do you keep the
 
04:28:41.270 --> 04:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
building clean how do you do all your
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
human relation stuff and hire and fire
 
04:28:46.350 --> 04:28:46.360 align:start position:0%

04:28:53.230 --> 04:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
federal regulations on that then you
 
04:28:55.948 --> 04:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
have another big area called C and PD
 
04:28:57.390 --> 04:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum assessment instruction
 
04:28:59.350 --> 04:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
professional development curriculum the
 
04:29:00.990 --> 04:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
standards we're going to look at
 
04:29:03.230 --> 04:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
assessments how we look at kids and make
 
04:29:04.750 --> 04:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
sure that they're learning and
 
04:29:06.430 --> 04:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
instruction how we actually instruct
 
04:29:08.230 --> 04:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
them and then how do we teach teach
 
04:29:10.990 --> 04:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
teachers usually you have a c person in
 
04:29:12.788 --> 04:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
your SAU you have a person that's going
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
to focus on that area I
 
04:29:19.030 --> 04:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
know I'm G you were a Cai person because
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
I tried to get your job one year or when
 
04:29:23.430 --> 04:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
you left I tried to get your job and and
 
04:29:25.628 --> 04:29:25.638 align:start position:0%
you you were excellent at it and I
 
04:29:28.190 --> 04:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
started in that realm but that wasn't me
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it's data assessment data informed
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
ass ISS all right special education the
 
04:29:34.868 --> 04:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
next one usually there's a central
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
office person in special education
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
highly technical very um uh easy to get
 
04:29:43.310 --> 04:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
in trouble a lot of rules you're dealing
 
04:29:46.150 --> 04:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
with the most fragile and the most needy
 
04:29:48.750 --> 04:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
kids in your district and it is totally
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
organized here's what I almost forget to
 
04:29:54.270 --> 04:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
put down um repone Hollywood is very
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
angry at me Labor Relations and
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
unions Miro was my uh my uh
 
04:30:05.190 --> 04:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh Union head when I was in BO it's
 
04:30:07.310 --> 04:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're in a union environment you got to
 
04:30:10.708 --> 04:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
negotiate a CBA you got to live by a CBA
 
04:30:13.230 --> 04:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
and although she may not believe it I am
 
04:30:15.230 --> 04:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
pro-union in education I think they
 
04:30:16.868 --> 04:30:16.878 align:start position:0%
represent the teachers they represent
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
the teachers interests and they need to
 
04:30:20.788 --> 04:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
be represented because they're the ones
 
04:30:23.788 --> 04:30:23.798 align:start position:0%
who actually deliver education to our to
 
04:30:23.798 --> 04:30:24.510 align:start position:0%
who actually deliver education to our to
our

04:30:24.510 --> 04:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:30:26.590 --> 04:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
students then just the stuff that
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
everyone does safety security physical
 
04:30:30.990 --> 04:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
cyber and emotional
 
04:30:33.430 --> 04:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we got to build schools almost like
 
04:30:35.310 --> 04:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
prisons now with with with with
 
04:30:37.390 --> 04:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
entrances that prevent lockdowns we got
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
to teach kids what to do if an intruder
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
comes walking through your door with
 
04:30:42.150 --> 04:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
with a
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
rifle that's tough emotional security we
 
04:30:47.150 --> 04:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
deal with kids who are have adverse
 
04:30:49.548 --> 04:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
childhood um events and they need to
 
04:30:50.910 --> 04:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
come in and make sure that they are safe
 
04:30:52.470 --> 04:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
and secure for they can learn and then
 
04:30:54.430 --> 04:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
cyber security I don't know if you heard
 
04:30:55.830 --> 04:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
what happened to Newfound but they lost
 
04:30:59.230 --> 04:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
all their data they got hacked they got
 
04:31:01.230 --> 04:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
hacked they lost everything everything
 
04:31:02.628 --> 04:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
they don't even have their special ed
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
records so you better have some cyber
 
04:31:06.628 --> 04:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
security in there because you're going
 
04:31:09.628 --> 04:31:09.638 align:start position:0%
to be um difficult then you do some team
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
building evaluation with people you do
 
04:31:13.470 --> 04:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
community engagement you do board work
 
04:31:16.270 --> 04:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
and policy and then to your question you
 
04:31:18.868 --> 04:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
do the larger political context I I go
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
to the State Board of Education I come
 
04:31:23.190 --> 04:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
here to see you and talk to you to to
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully help you do your
 
04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
job so Bas they're also educational
 
04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
leaders and there's no certification now
 
04:31:34.750 --> 04:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
so last year the ba went uh Dwayne Ford
 
04:31:36.270 --> 04:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
is my ba I went and talked to him this
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
morning I don't want to misrepresent him
 
04:31:40.190 --> 04:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here just talking about me I'm not
 
04:31:42.510 --> 04:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
talking about nhsa or anything but the
 
04:31:44.390 --> 04:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
certification no longer
 
04:31:46.868 --> 04:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
exists uh the the the problem is there
 
04:31:49.230 --> 04:31:49.240 align:start position:0%
is no College Prep program for Bas right
 
04:31:51.350 --> 04:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
now there just isn't so you go and you
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
get a a preparation in finance or or
 
04:31:56.230 --> 04:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of college degree but asbo
 
04:31:58.470 --> 04:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
actually had developed a very good ba
 
04:32:01.390 --> 04:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
certification program that uh that they
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
were running and they were getting up
 
04:32:04.350 --> 04:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
off the ground and they went to the
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
state board and they said hey you know
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
we know it's difficult to to have Bas we
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
know it's difficult to find a
 
04:32:13.948 --> 04:32:13.958 align:start position:0%
preparation program but here's asbo and
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
they were just told we're not going to
 
04:32:18.030 --> 04:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
have that certification anymore no
 
04:32:20.510 --> 04:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
reason no rule just we're not going to
 
04:32:23.390 --> 04:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
have the certification anymore um and
 
04:32:25.230 --> 04:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
that's too bad and and Dwayne would like
 
04:32:27.150 --> 04:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
to see it come back I've talked to my BA
 
04:32:28.708 --> 04:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
down in Grandam she'd like to see him
 
04:32:30.708 --> 04:32:30.718 align:start position:0%
come back because some sense they are
 
04:32:33.150 --> 04:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
the real leaders of the district because
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
I often had to ask Dwayne permission to
 
04:32:37.628 --> 04:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
spend money because money rules and
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're Reales and it's highly regulated
 
04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
technical job so can we can we get
 
04:32:45.350 --> 04:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
certification back for Bas and I don't
 
04:32:46.628 --> 04:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
think you have to argue about what that
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
has to look like in here but I agree
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
that you really should should have one
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
um and there's a shortage of Ed leaders
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know why well we're on the front
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
line of the cultural War we know that we
 
04:33:01.310 --> 04:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
lead divided Comm unities and right now
 
04:33:02.628 --> 04:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a culture of
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
Confrontation and sound bites it's very
 
04:33:06.628 --> 04:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
hard to pull the opposite sides together
 
04:33:08.510 --> 04:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
and get collaboration and problem
 
04:33:10.628 --> 04:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
solving I think later on you'll deal
 
04:33:13.030 --> 04:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
with another problem there are too many
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
districts districts are splitting apart
 
04:33:16.708 --> 04:33:16.718 align:start position:0%
from each other there just so many
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent open and a lot of them
 
04:33:20.110 --> 04:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
are small so you'll be looking at
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
consolidation any uh soon and there are
 
04:33:24.788 --> 04:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
too many boards I mean I talk to
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
superintendents who have 13 boards or
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
not 13 boards but 13 nights out because
 
04:33:31.350 --> 04:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
they have all these boards they have to
 
04:33:33.708 --> 04:33:33.718 align:start position:0%
report to boards take time to manage and
 
04:33:33.718 --> 04:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
report to boards take time to manage and
so

04:33:34.470 --> 04:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
forth and I just want to say that that
 
04:33:40.190 --> 04:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
these educational jobs are a full-time
 
04:33:43.350 --> 04:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
247365 job
 
04:33:45.708 --> 04:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
247365 I have to have this phone on all
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
the time and be able to be contacted
 
04:33:49.190 --> 04:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
because you never know when something's
 
04:33:51.868 --> 04:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
going to happen like this morning I
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was a bad snowstorm but
 
04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
they called me up and said hey I had a
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
terrible time getting into school today
 
04:33:58.788 --> 04:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
how come we didn't call off school like
 
04:34:01.270 --> 04:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
and even part-time you have this all
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
these things that I described to you in
 
04:34:05.430 --> 04:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
a big system you got all sorts of
 
04:34:06.910 --> 04:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
different people doing them in a small
 
04:34:10.510 --> 04:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
system that's all one person so let me
 
04:34:13.110 --> 04:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
finish up here I'm sorry I've taken so
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
long you know but I still I still have a
 
04:34:19.430 --> 04:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of hope I do because you
 
04:34:21.390 --> 04:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
know I I believe in educational
 
04:34:23.548 --> 04:34:23.558 align:start position:0%
leadership I believe in public schools
 
04:34:25.510 --> 04:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
we teaching to touch the future it's
 
04:34:27.948 --> 04:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
about the kids in our future if we can
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
build a society where all are valued all
 
04:34:34.190 --> 04:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
are encouraged to contribute if we can
 
04:34:36.390 --> 04:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
build a society or we can debate policy
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
without attacking or denigrating the
 
04:34:40.708 --> 04:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
other then I think we can build a
 
04:34:43.150 --> 04:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
society that learns and grows and can
 
04:34:45.430 --> 04:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
deal with complex issues like climate
 
04:34:49.150 --> 04:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
change like AI like distribution of food
 
04:34:49.160 --> 04:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
change like AI like distribution of food
and

04:34:50.750 --> 04:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
energy so in
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
some I speak in support of this
 
04:34:59.270 --> 04:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
bill um I think we need to support
 
04:35:00.510 --> 04:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
public educ
 
04:35:03.750 --> 04:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
a um I'm going to talk a little bit
 
04:35:05.190 --> 04:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
about the state board and
 
04:35:09.030 --> 04:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh it's difficult right now
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
because their focus is on efas Charters
 
04:35:14.510 --> 04:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
and and and using money for private
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
education understand that political
 
04:35:18.628 --> 04:35:18.638 align:start position:0%
world I'm I'm not here to debate it but
 
04:35:20.670 --> 04:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
you go back into their agendas you go
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
back into the things that they're paying
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
attention to those are the things are
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
paying attention can can you stick to
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
the bill please you got it so you got
 
04:35:31.548 --> 04:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
the 306s the essential regulations that
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the minimum
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
standards that's a huge one that needs
 
04:35:38.110 --> 04:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
to support Public Schools it's been kind
 
04:35:38.120 --> 04:35:39.270 align:start position:0%
to support Public Schools it's been kind
of

04:35:39.270 --> 04:35:39.280 align:start position:0%

04:35:41.628 --> 04:35:41.638 align:start position:0%

04:35:44.110 --> 04:35:44.120 align:start position:0%

lad about I know you get upset about the
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
failure to file reports I mean you need
 
04:35:51.270 --> 04:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
good data you need data as a legislator
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
the state needs data and it's getting
 
04:35:55.788 --> 04:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
better you know with the State student
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%

Caitlyn runs uh a once a month call
 
04:36:18.910 --> 04:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
which talks about all that technical
 
04:36:21.310 --> 04:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
stuff I talked about she covers it and
 
04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
she covers who does it so sorry for the
 
04:36:25.270 --> 04:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
long-winded one I don't get out of the
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
house much these days I'm sem re tired
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to give you a flavor
 
04:36:31.110 --> 04:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
for what educ ational leaders alike and
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes we do need standards for Ed leaders
 
04:36:36.110 --> 04:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
both superintendents and principles uh
 
04:36:37.948 --> 04:36:37.958 align:start position:0%
superintendents and Bas but it really
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
should be done at the state board but
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's not thank you thank you very much
 
04:36:43.750 --> 04:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:36:45.390 --> 04:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
04:36:47.390 --> 04:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:36:49.830 --> 04:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um you noted that
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
schools are in fact in a tough spot
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
right now there schools are really
 
04:36:56.788 --> 04:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
schools are at the Forefront as you said
 
04:36:58.990 --> 04:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the culture war and uh there's a lot
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
of divisive things out there happening
 
04:37:03.030 --> 04:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
um I can certainly understand that
 
04:37:06.270 --> 04:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
environment um you said that you have to
 
04:37:08.430 --> 04:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
bring all these communities together and
 
04:37:11.190 --> 04:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
you also said that schools really in
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
order to serve the students must as a
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
foremost operating principle align
 
04:37:17.948 --> 04:37:17.958 align:start position:0%
around the concept of equity but we've
 
04:37:20.030 --> 04:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
seen in in many places in other states
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
from presidential candidates that um
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
Equity is being prohibited from the
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
classrooms it's happening in Florida
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's happening in Texas it's happening
 
04:37:28.628 --> 04:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
in Oklahoma uh multiple presidential
 
04:37:30.430 --> 04:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
cand candidates have talked about that
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court struck down equity and
 
04:37:34.708 --> 04:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
admissions at Harvard based on
 
04:37:36.868 --> 04:37:36.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination so I I guess my question
 
04:37:39.470 --> 04:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
is how How are schools able to bring
 
04:37:41.230 --> 04:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
these divided communities together if
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
they're orienting themselves around what
 
04:37:45.628 --> 04:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
is ultimately a divisive political
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
Equity I get schooled on Equity by Cy
 
04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
like it and I was I was very similar I
 
04:37:58.230 --> 04:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
like what's this Equity thing what why
 
04:38:00.350 --> 04:38:00.360 align:start position:0%
do we need it
 
04:38:02.628 --> 04:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
equality is we when we give everyone the
 
04:38:02.638 --> 04:38:03.548 align:start position:0%
equality is we when we give everyone the
same

04:38:03.548 --> 04:38:03.558 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
thing Equity is when we look at the
 
04:38:09.110 --> 04:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
individual need of the person and we may
 
04:38:12.270 --> 04:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
give more to a person than another
 
04:38:14.830 --> 04:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
person for example a special needs
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
student I have a special need student
 
04:38:19.390 --> 04:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
who we are paying probably I think
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
around $400,000 to educate that single
 
04:38:26.430 --> 04:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
student that's Equity that student needs
 
04:38:29.628 --> 04:38:29.638 align:start position:0%
that and able to function and and that's
 
04:38:31.190 --> 04:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
the principle of equity I'm talking
 
04:38:32.830 --> 04:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
about the principle of equity is looking
 
04:38:35.430 --> 04:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
at the individual needs of the community
 
04:38:38.510 --> 04:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
and giving what is needed at the time
 
04:38:41.548 --> 04:38:41.558 align:start position:0%
now there's also deij I won't I won't
 
04:38:43.670 --> 04:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
get into there there are historical
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
groups that are that are under
 
04:38:47.548 --> 04:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
repesentative and have been underserved
 
04:38:49.468 --> 04:38:49.478 align:start position:0%
I mean you can look at statistics about
 
04:38:51.708 --> 04:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
minority students and what what why do
 
04:38:54.270 --> 04:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
black boys tend not to read it's not
 
04:38:55.350 --> 04:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
that they can't read it's not that
 
04:38:57.350 --> 04:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're any less talented it's that they
 
04:38:59.788 --> 04:38:59.798 align:start position:0%
haven't had the resources put to them so
 
04:39:01.190 --> 04:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
there are some historic groups but I
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
would agree with you we can't go too far
 
04:39:04.468 --> 04:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
the other way in trying to balance out
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
historic injustices and create inequity
 
04:39:10.230 --> 04:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
in what we're doing now but the basic
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
concept is everyone comes in and gets
 
04:39:15.468 --> 04:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
what they need in our school but thank
 
04:39:18.150 --> 04:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much have a

write neat on my card uh because i' I've
 
04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
heard you reference that in the past so
 
04:40:13.708 --> 04:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
I I really did try to write I didn't
 
04:40:15.150 --> 04:40:15.160 align:start position:0%

Association which are system leaders
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%

04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
the principal's Association we
 
04:40:38.110 --> 04:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the um with nasbo as
 
04:40:40.750 --> 04:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
well the business officials Association
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
and essentially we want to ensure that
 
04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
we are all working together to the
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of the public education system
 
04:40:49.948 --> 04:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
and the 165,000 or so students that are
 
04:40:52.830 --> 04:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
in the care of uh all the Great Schools
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
across our state so um I have spoken uh
 
04:40:58.548 --> 04:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
briefly with representative luno about
 
04:41:00.910 --> 04:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and as representative luno
 
04:41:03.548 --> 04:41:03.558 align:start position:0%
stated essentially this is a placeholder
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
Bill to ensure that we have a way to
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
bring forward standards that hold high
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
standards for New Hampshire's B business
 
04:41:15.830 --> 04:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
and superintendent officials but also
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
04:41:20.190 --> 04:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility excuse me as Dr cascaden
 
04:41:22.190 --> 04:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
referenced each school is different each
 
04:41:23.708 --> 04:41:23.718 align:start position:0%
school system is different and needs are
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
different in the North Country you have
 
04:41:28.750 --> 04:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
schools and districts that are having
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
trouble recruiting educational leaders
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
um I think that seven of the 10
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
superintendents in the North country are
 
04:41:36.750 --> 04:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
going to there's going to be some
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
turnover there within the next year or
 
04:41:42.390 --> 04:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
so that's a significant turnover and for
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
for the state and for public education
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
schools to be able to attract quality
 
04:41:51.150 --> 04:41:51.160 align:start position:0%
Leaders with standards and to ensure
 
04:41:52.670 --> 04:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
that they have the skills and support
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
that they need to succeed we do need
 
04:41:56.830 --> 04:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
some standards in place but we also need
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
some flexibility in place and I believe
 
04:42:01.270 --> 04:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we can work with representative
 
04:42:04.390 --> 04:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
luno to craft a bill uh and some
 
04:42:06.670 --> 04:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
language that provides that so I'm
 
04:42:09.150 --> 04:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
certainly uh willing to answer any
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have but um just
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to let folks know that we support
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
high standards we also support
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility and we want to ensure that
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to attract and
 
04:42:23.830 --> 04:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
retain talented educational leaders and
 
04:42:26.030 --> 04:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
just for context I was a superintendent
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
for nine years so I did beat the
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
three-year average and I was an
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent for 3 years
 
04:42:33.990 --> 04:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
before that so I did 12 years of service
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
in um the SAU level and honestly I
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
enjoyed every minute of it thank you
 
04:42:43.150 --> 04:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
representa cascaden thank you Mr chair
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for my um for taking my
 
04:42:47.590 --> 04:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if you have this
 
04:42:48.628 --> 04:42:48.638 align:start position:0%
answer but I haven't been a
 
04:42:50.830 --> 04:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent in two years since I left
 
04:42:53.468 --> 04:42:53.478 align:start position:0%
line what drastically
 
04:42:57.788 --> 04:42:57.798 align:start position:0%
changed in the rules um for
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
superintendents can you yeah anything
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
out particular so if you look at the
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
rules that are in this particular bill I
 
04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
believe a lot of that is a roll back to
 
04:43:09.390 --> 04:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
the previous rules that were existed
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
along with some other placeholder
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
language that representative Luna uh
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
grabbed um the my understanding of the
 
04:43:19.030 --> 04:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
changes to the 506 is it was 50601 which
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
is the standards for superintendent and
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know off the top of my head what
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
the actual reference is for um business
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
officials but it's in the 506 I believe
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
pulled it up um also it's connected to
 
04:43:34.510 --> 04:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
50503 and uh 5054 I believe which is
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
about um the way that you can get
 
04:43:39.910 --> 04:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
certified um I I believe that
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
superintendents need us the option of a
 
04:43:45.070 --> 04:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
site-based licensing plan because we
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
need to be able to work with leaders uh
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
in a way that allows folks to understand
 
04:43:52.548 --> 04:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way of doing it
 
04:43:55.468 --> 04:43:55.478 align:start position:0%
connect with experienced colleagues and
 
04:43:59.310 --> 04:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh the current changes actually has the
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
language that allows for a mentor
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
program a state board approved Mentor
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
program and the New Hampshire school
 
04:44:07.468 --> 04:44:07.478 align:start position:0%
administrators Association is currently
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
working on a state board approved Mentor
 
04:44:11.350 --> 04:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
program which they had been working on
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
prior to any of these changes these
 
04:44:16.270 --> 04:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
changes and potentially the ability to
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
put site-based licensing plans back into
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
certification standards allows for folks
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
to learn from colleagues in the field to
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
learn the New Hampshire way and
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
additionally it allows for some clearer
 
04:44:30.708 --> 04:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
reciprocity because we do have some
 
04:44:32.990 --> 04:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
issues with reciprocity right now where
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
we have superintendents and educational
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
leaders from other states who come in
 
04:44:40.270 --> 04:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
and have issues gaining certification
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
I've had many conversations with Folks
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
at the department and they're extremely
 
04:44:46.110 --> 04:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
supportive and collaborative when it
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
comes to working on the rulemaking as
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
well so I do believe that there is a
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
good effort on all fronts right now to
 
04:44:55.110 --> 04:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have high standards there
 
04:44:57.390 --> 04:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
should be credentialing standards for
 
04:44:59.468 --> 04:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
all all of these important positions but
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
at the same time to recognize that if
 
04:45:04.830 --> 04:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
we're not reacting to supply and demand
 
04:45:06.510 --> 04:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
in a way that we're changing some of the
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
way that we're looking at this then
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're just going to continue to
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
exacerbate the problems that we have
 
04:45:13.548 --> 04:45:13.558 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Personnel
 
04:45:13.558 --> 04:45:15.910 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Personnel
shortages

04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
shortages
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
for being here um Dr cascaden mentioned
 
04:45:26.830 --> 04:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
earlier the importance of tenure within
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
the uh superintendency as far as
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
visioning and leading the district Etc
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh do you know or you aware of what what
 
04:45:38.468 --> 04:45:38.478 align:start position:0%
is in fact the average tenure of a
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
superintendent in a particular School
 
04:45:42.350 --> 04:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
District before they move to another one
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
right now the national average last time
 
04:45:48.990 --> 04:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
I did the research was 2.8 years and um
 
04:45:51.150 --> 04:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
that actually was the same average in
 
04:45:53.390 --> 04:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
1920 as it was in
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
2020 um and I think that's indicative of
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's an incredibly complex
 
04:46:00.910 --> 04:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
job and based on the size and the scope
 
04:46:03.468 --> 04:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
of the system and honestly the the skill
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
set of the person in charge they're
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to be connected to all of those
 
04:46:09.070 --> 04:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
disperate systems that you heard Dr
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
cascaden allude to so in New Hampshire
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I have not done the research but I
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe it's relatively close to that
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
same three-year national average but
 
04:46:22.030 --> 04:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation the last I knew the a
 
04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
rose somewhere around 2.8 Years thank
 
04:46:27.070 --> 04:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
you yeah further questions representa
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for
 
04:46:31.390 --> 04:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
taking my questions didn't the rule
 
04:46:33.788 --> 04:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
change um on credentialing for
 
04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
superintendant really interrupt programs
 
04:46:39.750 --> 04:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
that were go ongoing at that time are
 
04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
you referring uh thank you for the
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
question are you referring to higher
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
education programs uh the super yes the
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
higher education programs to uh
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
credential superintendant or to train
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
superintendant um I the New Hampshire
 
04:46:54.990 --> 04:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association has an
 
04:46:56.750 --> 04:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
articulation and agreement with Southern
 
04:46:59.548 --> 04:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire University and recently
 
04:47:02.468 --> 04:47:02.478 align:start position:0%
uh the CTE the um the council for
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
Teacher education I think that uh stands
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
for um not CTE as in what used to be
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
formerly vocational education um
 
04:47:13.230 --> 04:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
connected with um Southern New Hampshire
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
University as they are getting their
 
04:47:16.948 --> 04:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
program approved and they met with
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
glowing reviews as to what they've done
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
thus far and um that will be in front of
 
04:47:22.750 --> 04:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
the stateboard I believe at their
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
February meeting but um I can't speak at
 
04:47:30.030 --> 04:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
with any sort of level of of uh command
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
relative to how much it impacted ongoing
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
programs I can tell you that some
 
04:47:37.548 --> 04:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
programs such as uh Plymouth and some
 
04:47:41.468 --> 04:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
other programs had closed some of their
 
04:47:45.150 --> 04:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
um administrative credentialing programs
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
prior to that rule change and some of it
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
is just kind of based on um what's
 
04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
happening at those schools but I do
 
04:47:54.708 --> 04:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
believe if there is some appropriate
 
04:47:56.910 --> 04:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility again that maintains high
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
standards we may be able toing breathe
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
some life back into those
 
04:48:04.468 --> 04:48:04.478 align:start position:0%
programs have you worked with uh Steve
 
04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
applebe over at the department in terms
 
04:48:11.708 --> 04:48:11.718 align:start position:0%
of um if you're a school board and your
 
04:48:14.030 --> 04:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
superly we have have a lot of those
 
04:48:16.670 --> 04:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
positions are open right now is there
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
reciprocity between the New England
 
04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
states in terms of superintendent ship
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh where if I get my Cas at Oro is that
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
then accepted here in New Hampshire um
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I you know I
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know that reciprocity at this
 
04:48:35.310 --> 04:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
point is a crystal clear process I
 
04:48:38.468 --> 04:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
believe there are some ways uh to ensure
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
that's happening but I think there are
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
Hoops that must have to be um
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
encountered so um I have spoken to Steve
 
04:48:48.868 --> 04:48:48.878 align:start position:0%
applebe quite a bit um I have him on
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
speed dial he and I have connected quite
 
04:48:52.590 --> 04:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
often I connected with Bill Ross as well
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
and Laura ston King and Laura ston King
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
is connected to uh the programs that get
 
04:49:00.150 --> 04:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
approved um for for um preparation
 
04:49:03.910 --> 04:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
programs at at higher ed so in regard to
 
04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity I there have been some
 
04:49:08.270 --> 04:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
issues because we've had superintendents
 
04:49:11.070 --> 04:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
from other states Massachusetts Maine uh
 
04:49:12.670 --> 04:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
surrounding states who have had issues
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
gaining their certification so right now
 
04:49:17.788 --> 04:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
although reciprocity I think exists in
 
04:49:20.390 --> 04:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
some aspects of the law it's not clear
 
04:49:22.990 --> 04:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
and I believe there are um language
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
issues that make it difficult for people
 
04:49:26.590 --> 04:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
who have done the job in other states my
 
04:49:28.548 --> 04:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
last question for you and then I when
 
04:49:30.750 --> 04:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
when a superintendent decides to leave
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
the district i. we just lost one up in
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
Newfound Lake Area um does does your
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
organization the school administrators
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
Association do anything like an exit
 
04:49:44.110 --> 04:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
interview or discussion try to start
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
ranking down the rationale and the
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
reasons or why the why folks are leaving
 
04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
is it just you know the 13 different
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
meetings you have to conduct at with
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
school boards throughout the world here
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
or is it because of Aging out or is it
 
04:49:59.390 --> 04:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
because of medical reasons what
 
04:50:02.110 --> 04:50:02.120 align:start position:0%
what we're very connected to the
 
04:50:03.990 --> 04:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent and system leaders when I
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
say we the New Hampshire school
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
administrators Association to
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent and system leaders around
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
the state so when there are changes that
 
04:50:13.468 --> 04:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
are happening we're typically very
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
connected to the reasons why that is
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
happening so for example um you
 
04:50:20.670 --> 04:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
reference Newfound Lake uh we've been in
 
04:50:24.510 --> 04:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
contact with um superintendent nyas um
 
04:50:26.190 --> 04:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations with folks that
 
04:50:27.948 --> 04:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
have been connect that have been
 
04:50:29.708 --> 04:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
interested and applying for that job so
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to support those
 
04:50:33.948 --> 04:50:33.958 align:start position:0%
superintendents as they move out of
 
04:50:36.430 --> 04:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
their current role and look for and or
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
move into new roles and essentially um
 
04:50:42.628 --> 04:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
we also work very significantly with
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
superintendents who are new to the state
 
04:50:46.510 --> 04:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
or new to the position through a variety
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
of ways through the granite state
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
Leadership Academy we have new system
 
04:50:52.390 --> 04:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
leader orientation every single year and
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
we uh connect with folks in a lot of the
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
informal ways as well but do we have a
 
04:51:00.670 --> 04:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
formal um exit interview process we
 
04:51:02.270 --> 04:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a formal exit interview
 
04:51:03.628 --> 04:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
process but we do have a lot of
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
connections and understand the reasons
 
04:51:07.868 --> 04:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
why folks are leaving sometimes those
 
04:51:10.110 --> 04:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
are confidential reasons uh sometimes
 
04:51:12.868 --> 04:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
those are very very public reasons thank
 
04:51:12.878 --> 04:51:15.390 align:start position:0%
those are very very public reasons thank
you

04:51:15.390 --> 04:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:51:18.430 --> 04:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
you and we do not have any other cards
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
on this bill so we will exit this
 
04:51:29.430 --> 04:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
bill okay can you grab mark yeah I'll
 
04:51:31.468 --> 04:51:31.478 align:start position:0%
get her to go
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
go now by the way for the committee the
 
04:51:59.750 --> 04:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
bills which we did not execute this
 
04:52:02.468 --> 04:52:02.478 align:start position:0%
morning they have been put on the next
 
04:52:04.830 --> 04:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
week's docket so we won't be dealing
 
04:52:07.750 --> 04:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
with any more today on those
 
04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.468 --> 04:52:13.478 align:start position:0%
me no we're just picking up where that
 
04:52:16.030 --> 04:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
motion was so that those sessions will
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
continue at the next round of executive
 
04:52:19.868 --> 04:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
sessions which we have that'll be first
 
04:52:24.070 --> 04:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
one on the doc we got to get these early
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
bills completed going on right now we
 
04:52:27.280 --> 04:52:30.788 align:start position:0%
bills completed going on right now we
have

04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.390 --> 04:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's correct we're in that
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
week yeah and that that should be out

done sort
 
04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
of well if you're on a subcommittee or
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%

penalty for failure to file School
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
expenditure reports um I think maybe
 
04:53:43.350 --> 04:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's one before that yeah oh that
 
04:53:44.708 --> 04:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm the wrong line here there
 
04:53:46.430 --> 04:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
are two superintendent bills here
 
04:53:47.548 --> 04:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
relative to the duties and
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of superintendents of
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
1552 go for it represent cordelli uh
 
04:53:59.390 --> 04:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:54:01.230 --> 04:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues for the record
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
Glenn cordelli representing tuon Boro
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
Molton B tuon Boro wolfboro and oopy in
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
the beautiful Lakes Region and uh this
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully is a a little simpler bill um
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
the handout that I gave you is just in
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
case you don't have your books with you
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
is uh sections 194 C4 and C5 which we
 
04:54:23.310 --> 04:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
will be talking about
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
primarily uh the main objective of this
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill is if you look at 194 C5
 
04:54:35.670 --> 04:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
2A superintendent services are
 
04:54:38.670 --> 04:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
required superintendence or
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
not um very often reading through the um
 
04:54:47.468 --> 04:54:47.478 align:start position:0%
education rsas and and elsewhere you'll
 
04:54:51.468 --> 04:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
see that it just says the superintendent
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
shall do this or do that there's 20 25
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
spots where that occurs
 
04:55:02.190 --> 04:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
um I thought that we should make it
 
04:55:02.200 --> 04:55:03.270 align:start position:0%
um I thought that we should make it
accurate

04:55:03.270 --> 04:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
throughout U by saying the
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent or Personnel assigned to
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
perform superintendent Services as per
 
04:55:14.910 --> 04:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
194 C5
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
2A um so in this
 
04:55:17.760 --> 04:55:19.788 align:start position:0%
2A um so in this
bill

04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:55:23.708 --> 04:55:23.718 align:start position:0%
under 194c which you'll see on the flip
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
side of the page um outlines the
 
04:55:28.628 --> 04:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent services
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
and there are quite a few of them um
 
04:55:32.280 --> 04:55:33.150 align:start position:0%
and there are quite a few of them um
through

04:55:33.150 --> 04:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:55:36.750 --> 04:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
R uh we insert a section and this is in
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
lines 3 through
 
04:55:38.520 --> 04:55:41.990 align:start position:0%
lines 3 through
five

04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:47.430 --> 04:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
um basically that um this title the
 
04:55:50.230 --> 04:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh May
 
04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
mean uh Personnel assigned to perform
 
04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
these Services which hopefully should
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
cover most of the
 
04:56:01.590 --> 04:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
doe um
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
rsas that we all know and love um on
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
lines through through um 12 or so U
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
there is this fire safety uh section of
 
04:56:18.430 --> 04:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
law that also refers to superintendence
 
04:56:23.190 --> 04:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
so we modify that uh RSA
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
15314 to add or Personnel assigned to
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
perform superintendent services
 
04:56:29.080 --> 04:56:30.230 align:start position:0%
perform superintendent services
um

04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:34.750 --> 04:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
likewise there is a section in 170 which
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
um is um a conglomeration of many
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
different uh Ru making
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
authorities um related to
 
04:56:48.270 --> 04:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and one of them uh
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
B3 uh dealt with superintendence so
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
there again we added that same language
 
04:56:56.788 --> 04:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
or Personnel assigned to perform those
 
04:57:00.868 --> 04:57:00.878 align:start position:0%
services and then the last section for
 
04:57:05.350 --> 04:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
single administrative units um this was
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh a need uh brought to our attention
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
with this bill that is superintendent in
 
04:57:12.990 --> 04:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
a single District could also get
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
alternative certification we talked
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative lad just talked about
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
alternative certification a few minutes
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
ago uh this would be U for allowing uh
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
especially in a small small SAU uh you
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
know I know of three 400 student saus
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
and the superintendent could qualify uh
 
04:57:35.750 --> 04:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
as a principal as well as superintendent
 
04:57:38.430 --> 04:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the intent to that
 
04:57:41.230 --> 04:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
section and that really covers uh the
 
04:57:43.948 --> 04:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
intent of the Bill thank you thank you
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
any questions for representa cordelli
 
04:57:48.868 --> 04:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you um from
 
04:57:51.948 --> 04:57:51.958 align:start position:0%
my days gone by when I served in some of
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
those rules um the
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent usually well I worked in
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
moderate size and bigger school
 
04:58:02.430 --> 04:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
districts usually the superintendent had
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
assigned someone else to do that task um
 
04:58:07.390 --> 04:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
because there are there are a list of
 
04:58:09.150 --> 04:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
things that the superintendents are
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for submitting and making
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
sure are in place in the school
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
districts um usually somebody else did
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
it um being assistant I did a lot of
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
that stuff but the superintendent always
 
04:58:26.350 --> 04:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
signed off on it so my fear by
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
designating another other person um that
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
who may or may not um do their job if if
 
04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
the superintendent doesn't ultimately
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
have to be responsible for it that task
 
04:58:43.868 --> 04:58:43.878 align:start position:0%
may end up NE never getting done or
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
there might be some oversight and
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately the superintendent is the
 
04:58:50.468 --> 04:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
final word um along with the school
 
04:58:52.548 --> 04:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
board of course but the superintendent
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
holds that responsibility for all of
 
04:58:58.270 --> 04:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
those tasks so that's my only concern um
 
04:59:01.150 --> 04:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
because usually that happens anyway but
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
somebody has to be responsible for
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
getting those reports to the doe and
 
04:59:07.628 --> 04:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
making sure they're signed off on it's
 
04:59:09.868 --> 04:59:09.878 align:start position:0%
like the insurances that we have to sign
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
every year um saying that we adhere to
 
04:59:16.510 --> 04:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
these things um it it's somebody's got
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
to be the boss so that's my only concern
 
04:59:21.868 --> 04:59:21.878 align:start position:0%
about designating somebody else could
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
you respond please sure thank you um
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
04:59:26.638 --> 04:59:28.270 align:start position:0%
yeah I
think

04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:59:32.670 --> 04:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you um uh indicating is that
 
04:59:35.310 --> 04:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
some of these um services on the other
 
04:59:37.390 --> 04:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
side of the page uh certainly could be
 
04:59:40.468 --> 04:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
developed or performed by someone else a
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
design if you will assistant um and I
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't see any problem with that but the
 
04:59:50.750 --> 04:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
statute does say that it the school
 
04:59:52.830 --> 04:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
districts especially small districts are
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
not required to have a
 
04:59:56.910 --> 04:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent they could assign someone
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
to the to perform those services and in
 
05:00:02.110 --> 05:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
that case that Personnel that staff
 
05:00:03.948 --> 05:00:03.958 align:start position:0%
person would be
 
05:00:06.750 --> 05:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
responsible um for performing those
 
05:00:09.230 --> 05:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
services and be the one whose uh name
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
was on the bottom line and that they
 
05:00:12.990 --> 05:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
were being performed or the reports
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to doe as you indicate
 
05:00:18.430 --> 05:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
thank further questions yes
 
05:00:19.510 --> 05:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and then
 
05:00:23.230 --> 05:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you um a couple questions uh
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
specifically uh
 
05:00:31.750 --> 05:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
towards the line of us um I'm looking at
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
the two definitions of lack thereof on
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
line 24 and 25 the definition of
 
05:00:39.310 --> 05:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
principal instructural leader and
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
progress they you're looking for a
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
definition I I I think probably
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
instructional leader is elsewhere in
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
statute um you know this language was
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
was given to me um so I assume that that
 
05:01:01.708 --> 05:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
was in statute and certainly rigorous
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
process um you know we we've used the
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
terms um in terms of adequate education
 
05:01:11.948 --> 05:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
we just added rigor as a criteria for um
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
academic instruction so I I don't see a
 
05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
necessity for a rigorous definition per
 
05:01:23.708 --> 05:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
se okay I thank you I just don't
 
05:01:25.230 --> 05:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
understand what rigorous process is of
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
trying to I'm reading this as a a people
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
a person who is interested in a position
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where it's not
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
defined yeah I I through a process you
 
05:01:38.468 --> 05:01:38.478 align:start position:0%
know I think anyone who um goes through
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh a process um to be assigned a role
 
05:01:46.548 --> 05:01:46.558 align:start position:0%
such as that uh I think the school board
 
05:01:49.150 --> 05:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
um would certainly from my experience go
 
05:01:50.910 --> 05:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
through a rigorous process to make sure
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
that that person was qualified not
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing Define it's just
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever the school wants thank you
 
05:02:00.468 --> 05:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
rep represent Damon did you have here
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
no represent mil thank you Mr chair and
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this forward uh
 
05:02:07.548 --> 05:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
well the question that I would have
 
05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
would it be possible under this language
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh for let's say in a small school
 
05:02:16.750 --> 05:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
district for the uh School Board uh to
 
05:02:19.670 --> 05:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
identify a local individual who's not
 
05:02:23.270 --> 05:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
employed in the school district um has
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
no background really in education but
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
maybe back ground in business or
 
05:02:32.430 --> 05:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
whatever uh could that person qualify
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
for uh this uh Personnel assigned
 
05:02:40.030 --> 05:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
to um I I thank you for the question I
 
05:02:42.548 --> 05:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
think that the um RSA says
 
05:02:45.468 --> 05:02:45.478 align:start position:0%
administrative Personnel so it certainly
 
05:02:47.788 --> 05:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
could be the business manager for
 
05:02:49.628 --> 05:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
instance could be per assigned to
 
05:02:51.990 --> 05:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
perform some of these functions uh
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
follow up yes go ahead uh so your intent
 
05:02:57.468 --> 05:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
here is for somebody who's already
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
employed within the school district
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
might be either fulltime or parttime
 
05:03:03.868 --> 05:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
yeah might be a principal for example
 
05:03:06.468 --> 05:03:06.478 align:start position:0%
correct but it's not somebody from just
 
05:03:09.628 --> 05:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
outside the school Community for example
 
05:03:11.590 --> 05:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be hired be somebody within that's
 
05:03:13.990 --> 05:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
your intent that's my intent and my
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's in statute now
 
05:03:19.510 --> 05:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions representa
 
05:03:21.628 --> 05:03:21.638 align:start position:0%
Aon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:03:23.270 --> 05:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
question so in what way if any does the
 
05:03:29.070 --> 05:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
post statute
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
address a school board member deciding
 
05:03:35.230 --> 05:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
to or Schoolboard collectively deciding
 
05:03:38.270 --> 05:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
to take on these
 
05:03:41.468 --> 05:03:41.478 align:start position:0%
tasks um I I don't think that that would
 
05:03:43.910 --> 05:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
fit under current
 
05:03:47.110 --> 05:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
law um which says
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
administrative Personnel working in the
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
district and this is in 2A under 194 C5
 
05:03:57.468 --> 05:03:57.478 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't think that School
 
05:04:00.430 --> 05:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
Board member would qualify
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
there represent cascaden thank you uh Mr
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question um
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
if Personnel were assigned to perform
 
05:04:09.600 --> 05:04:11.230 align:start position:0%
if Personnel were assigned to perform
superintendent

05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
Services let's just say um I don't know
 
05:04:17.548 --> 05:04:17.558 align:start position:0%
a principal would they be held liable or
 
05:04:19.390 --> 05:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
will the
 
05:04:21.990 --> 05:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent who's going to be held
 
05:04:24.510 --> 05:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
liable um I would think whoever is
 
05:04:27.468 --> 05:04:27.478 align:start position:0%
assigned by uh the school board to
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
perform those Services okay whether
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
not right yeah yes okay thank
 
05:04:38.310 --> 05:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:04:42.750 --> 05:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
Christina thank you chairman lad good
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee uh
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
Barett Christina from the school board
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
just Association uh we are not taking a
 
05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
specific position on this bill um but I
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
do have um a couple uh matters for the
 
05:05:05.910 --> 05:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee to consider and perhaps a
 
05:05:08.110 --> 05:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
question or two for uh representative
 
05:05:10.468 --> 05:05:10.478 align:start position:0%
cordelli to perhaps work on and bring an
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm looking at the language on
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
pay on lines 23 through
 
05:05:18.030 --> 05:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
27 um I'm specifically the
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
superintendent of a single School
 
05:05:22.350 --> 05:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
District may qualify for alternative
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
certification as a principal
 
05:05:27.310 --> 05:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
instructional leader um there's no
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
current certification for principal
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
instructional leaders under the 506
 
05:05:33.548 --> 05:05:33.558 align:start position:0%
rules that we've been talking about for
 
05:05:36.750 --> 05:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
the last 45 minutes or so um I know that
 
05:05:38.468 --> 05:05:38.478 align:start position:0%
that phrase principal instructional
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
leader was included in one of the drafts
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the 506 certification rules back in I
 
05:05:47.230 --> 05:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
believe maybe mid
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
2022 um but the final version that came
 
05:05:54.030 --> 05:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
out um of those rules um I think in uh
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
maybe April or May of 2023 does not con
 
05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
Ain that phrase principal instructional
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
leader so when it says alternative
 
05:06:02.590 --> 05:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
certification as a principal
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
instructional leader NH hsba thinks it
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
would be a better practice to relate the
 
05:06:09.390 --> 05:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
alternative certification to something
 
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
to a position with which the Department
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
of Education is currently
 
05:06:17.788 --> 05:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
certifying um also relative to um to the
 
05:06:20.670 --> 05:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh the alternative certification
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
05:06:24.708 --> 05:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
certification um called a district
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
administrator certification this is
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education rule 50
 
05:06:43.790 --> 05:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.800 --> 05:06:57.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
rator the district administrator
 
05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
certification is I call a principal plus
 
05:07:03.948 --> 05:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
their day-to-day responsibilities are
 
05:07:06.430 --> 05:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
are primarily serving as a principal
 
05:07:08.628 --> 05:07:08.638 align:start position:0%
within that K through 5 or K through six
 
05:07:10.788 --> 05:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
School District um but yet they're
 
05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
authorized under the certification rules
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
to sign off on perhaps Federal reports
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
and and and reports required by the
 
05:07:19.310 --> 05:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue administration
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
department of education so on and so
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
forth um so um uh uh the criteria um for
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
that District administrator
 
05:07:30.750 --> 05:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
certification is three years experience
 
05:07:34.750 --> 05:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
as a licensed principal 30 plus graduate
 
05:07:37.548 --> 05:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
um 30 or more graduate or postback Oria
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
credits and they demonstrated ability to
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
provide the services under RSA 194 C4 um
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's some other application
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
procedures so um again without taking a
 
05:07:49.150 --> 05:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
position on the bill I just wanted to
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
draw attention to um the alternative
 
05:07:53.350 --> 05:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
certification as a principal
 
05:07:55.708 --> 05:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
instructional leader again nsba thinks
 
05:07:57.150 --> 05:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
to principal instructional leaders
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
should be amended to include something
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
that is already within the certification
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
positions at the Department of Education
 
05:08:06.468 --> 05:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
so in representative Cordell if you
 
05:08:08.548 --> 05:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
would want to work on that um please by
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
only reach out to Becky she knows the
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
certification rules um more than I but
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
we're certainly to help with that we're
 
05:08:15.628 --> 05:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to help with that and
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to answer any
 
05:08:18.708 --> 05:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions of the
 
05:08:20.830 --> 05:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
05:08:22.868 --> 05:08:22.878 align:start position:0%

Just how important do you think uh from
 
05:08:32.670 --> 05:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
a school board's point of view is the
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the school well I mean
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%

05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
eight or 10 superintendent searches

that if in fact the school district was
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%

05:10:53.868 --> 05:10:53.878 align:start position:0%
of the overall School District in the
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%

certified you know I mean they're at
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
least meting you know creating the they
 
05:11:08.548 --> 05:11:08.558 align:start position:0%
at least met some some bare minimum
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
requirements you know I I I don't want
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
to comment on you know the
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent makes a mistake are they
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
you know was it an innocent mistake was
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
it incompetence was it something that
 
05:11:21.468 --> 05:11:21.478 align:start position:0%
the district KN you know if you know if
 
05:11:23.270 --> 05:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
if the superintendent was somehow con
 
05:11:23.280 --> 05:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
if the superintendent was somehow con
you

05:11:24.070 --> 05:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
know stealing money from his previous
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
job and you hire them and you're
 
05:11:30.030 --> 05:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
stealing money again well maybe maybe
 
05:11:32.190 --> 05:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
there's a level of you know issue with
 
05:11:34.830 --> 05:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
you know your hiring process perhaps but
 
05:11:35.830 --> 05:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
I mean you know I don't want to come up
 
05:11:38.350 --> 05:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
with extreme extreme examples I mean is
 
05:11:39.670 --> 05:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
the district going to get if the
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
district's going to get sued the
 
05:11:42.990 --> 05:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
district's going to get sued and and
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
then you know we got to figure out was
 
05:11:46.510 --> 05:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
their negligence that's the issue at
 
05:11:48.750 --> 05:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
hand so not whether or not the person is
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
competent or not competent yeah one
 
05:11:54.350 --> 05:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
other point too if I real could um I
 
05:11:56.468 --> 05:11:56.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the the the district ad
 
05:11:58.750 --> 05:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
administrator certification 400 students
 
05:12:00.628 --> 05:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
no more than no more than 400 students
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
no more than school buildings just as as
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is written it's a
 
05:12:06.350 --> 05:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent of a single School
 
05:12:07.868 --> 05:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
District could qualify as alternative
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
certification to some degree this would
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
be a school board question who you want
 
05:12:12.390 --> 05:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
to hire but just let's just be mindful
 
05:12:13.868 --> 05:12:13.878 align:start position:0%
that the two largest school districts in
 
05:12:15.990 --> 05:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
the state are single District saus that
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
being Manchester and nsha they're
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
probably going to want to have a
 
05:12:20.830 --> 05:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
certified superintendent there but for
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
for the smaller districts K through four
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
districts with 50 kids 200 kids whatever
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
it might be um you know and just for the
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
the the the just background I apologize
 
05:12:31.990 --> 05:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
for taking up time I know it's been a
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
long day um the district administrator
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
model um under the pertinent Department
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
of Education rule one school district
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
has used that model successfully for
 
05:12:45.468 --> 05:12:45.478 align:start position:0%
probably 12 or 15 years now late 2000
 
05:12:45.478 --> 05:12:46.310 align:start position:0%
probably 12 or 15 years now late 2000
early

05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
early
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
2010s um and then there are two
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
districts um that have tried it and it
 
05:12:54.110 --> 05:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
it it ended up not working for them so
 
05:12:55.430 --> 05:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
they went back to the more traditional
 
05:12:57.628 --> 05:12:57.638 align:start position:0%
model with a building level principal
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
and um a superintendent overseeing
 
05:13:03.628 --> 05:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
overseeing the rest of the staff so it's
 
05:13:05.590 --> 05:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
not used commonly but there are a couple
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
examples in New
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yep I was in one myself over
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
across the border in Maine y K through 8
 
05:13:14.708 --> 05:13:14.718 align:start position:0%
I was the principal and we were paying
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
too much to Rumford for our SAU sad yeah
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
so we decided to go by ourselves k
 
05:13:22.510 --> 05:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
through eight and then I took over as
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
combination principal superintendent yep
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
yep thank you yep so um any further
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
05:13:35.548 --> 05:13:35.558 align:start position:0%

05:13:38.310 --> 05:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill we have no other cards on it so
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
we'll like to go into the next bill
 
05:13:43.708 --> 05:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
1265 and 1265 is relative to the penalty
 
05:13:50.030 --> 05:13:50.040 align:start position:0%

05:15:31.590 --> 05:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
you look at RSA 1984 D it requires the
 
05:15:35.230 --> 05:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
doe2 and in requiring the doe2 they re
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
they list out who's required to submit
 
05:15:40.590 --> 05:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
the doe2 it includes district and
 
05:15:43.430 --> 05:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
Charters it does not include publicy so
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
that's the requirement to submit a doe2
 
05:15:50.830 --> 05:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
then in RSA 1984 f um there is what are
 
05:15:53.350 --> 05:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
the punishments for not doing a
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
doe2 and um extensions and who gets an
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
extension to be late on their doe2 and
 
05:16:04.750 --> 05:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
in that area law um it includes Publicis
 
05:16:06.430 --> 05:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
so there's an inconsistency who's
 
05:16:08.230 --> 05:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
required to do it and who's could be
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
punished for not doing it so publicy
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
could be punished for doing something
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're not required to do so um so it's
 
05:16:16.788 --> 05:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
just a it's a mix match and it's some
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
housekeeping um so if you strike public
 
05:16:21.868 --> 05:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
Academy from the penalty we would just
 
05:16:23.670 --> 05:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
have consistency on who is required to
 
05:16:26.270 --> 05:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
do a doe2 and who could be punished for
 
05:16:30.948 --> 05:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
it um I I put I put n um uh we don't
 
05:16:32.990 --> 05:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
have a position for or against this we
 
05:16:35.150 --> 05:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
did we did go to representative fellow
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
saying this is something we would like
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
to clean up I think previous sessions
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
you've seen bills to add public publicy
 
05:16:44.910 --> 05:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
to who's required to do a
 
05:16:47.788 --> 05:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
doe2 um so they'd be punished for not
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
doing a doe2 potentially and required to
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
do a
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
doe2 we sort of have no position either
 
05:16:55.708 --> 05:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
way we would like the law to be
 
05:16:55.718 --> 05:16:56.910 align:start position:0%
way we would like the law to be
consistent

05:16:56.910 --> 05:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
05:16:58.750 --> 05:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
um so this bill as introduced would make
 
05:17:02.430 --> 05:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
the law consistent um if
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
ifies um I know we've had some of these
 
05:17:06.670 --> 05:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
conversations uh we get our we get our
 
05:17:08.708 --> 05:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
do25 from districts districts have to do
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
that for two reasons to set taxes um
 
05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
publicy can't raise taxes districts
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
raise taxes um and financial reporting
 
05:17:18.150 --> 05:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
to the feds um and so the feds have
 
05:17:20.110 --> 05:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
never asked for publicy if they ever did
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
ask for public academes we would come to
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
House Education look for a bill to
 
05:17:26.230 --> 05:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
require that um but at this moment in
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
time um that section of the bill as
 
05:17:31.110 --> 05:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
introduces um some housekeeping and
 
05:17:32.510 --> 05:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's another section about adequacy
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
but I'll stop for questions about do 25s
 
05:17:35.160 --> 05:17:36.390 align:start position:0%
but I'll stop for questions about do 25s
and

05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
publicy yes represent Miler uh thank
 
05:17:40.990 --> 05:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here so are you
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
saying right now that publicy do not
 
05:17:48.270 --> 05:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
have to file form 25 correct so those
 
05:17:51.310 --> 05:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
Publicis would would include Co Brown
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton any others just those
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
two followup please yes
 
05:18:02.030 --> 05:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
so who then are you saying that because
 
05:18:03.628 --> 05:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
let's say let's take pinker as an
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
example pinkin gets students from dairy
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
primarily correct so who files the
 
05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
report does dairy file report Derry
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
files the report so we get a doe 25 from
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
Derry um and and and that's and they
 
05:18:23.560 --> 05:18:23.570 align:start position:0%
send their students to
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:24.910 align:start position:0%
send their students to
[Music]

05:18:24.910 --> 05:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:18:24.920 --> 05:18:26.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
pickron

05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
pickron
 
05:18:26.600 --> 05:18:28.030 align:start position:0%
pickron
uh

05:18:28.030 --> 05:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:31.390 --> 05:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
so so how do we know what Pinkerton is
 
05:18:32.708 --> 05:18:32.718 align:start position:0%
spending on
 
05:18:36.590 --> 05:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
schools uh so we only have we don't know
 
05:18:38.670 --> 05:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
what Pinkerton is doing specifically we
 
05:18:40.628 --> 05:18:40.638 align:start position:0%
know what der's doing so we don't have
 
05:18:40.638 --> 05:18:41.628 align:start position:0%
know what der's doing so we don't have
that

05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
data excuse me Mr chair I don't maybe
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
I'm missing something
 
05:18:46.400 --> 05:18:48.110 align:start position:0%
I'm missing something
here

05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:18:51.390 --> 05:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
but Dair provides
 
05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
tuition to Pinkerton correct Pinkerton
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
employees staff for that school to teach
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
the dairy children yes what is the
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
accountability then for how Pinkerton
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
spends their money from taxpayers from
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
dairy so at the state
 
05:19:12.160 --> 05:19:13.788 align:start position:0%
dairy so at the state
level

05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh I'm only talking about really
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
financial reporting from a financial
 
05:19:19.868 --> 05:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
reporting perspective we don't have a
 
05:19:22.750 --> 05:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
do25 from Pinkerton so we don't have any
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
insights into what Pinkerton is is
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
spending what Dairy can do at the local
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
level is they choose to go into use as
 
05:19:32.190 --> 05:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
as a provider use Pinker as a provider
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
they can do whatever they do through the
 
05:19:35.270 --> 05:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
the local process whether it is through
 
05:19:38.070 --> 05:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
contracts whatever it may be um but the
 
05:19:40.670 --> 05:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
state is not involved um in that process
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
that would be the accountability would
 
05:19:45.150 --> 05:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
essentially be local at that at that
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
moment rep
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much um what type of
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for taking my question
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
um Mr Manel what type of um
 
05:19:59.350 --> 05:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
well how do I how do I ask a question I
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
guess um um under what sort of corporate
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
structure are
 
05:20:08.910 --> 05:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
formed there and yeah I don't I don't I
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly I don't know um I
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
know der Pinkerton has been around for a
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
very long time um Co Brown I believe
 
05:20:20.230 --> 05:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
also been around for a long time I I
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
exactly uh for example are they
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
for-profit or non nonprofit
 
05:20:29.910 --> 05:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
businesses I can't answer I don't no
 
05:20:31.830 --> 05:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I think if we look at our
 
05:20:33.830 --> 05:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
records we did get the audit on
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton several years ago we had a
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill in that we did yeah and and we
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
looked at that audit and went through
 
05:20:43.750 --> 05:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
it but that's as far as my
 
05:20:46.310 --> 05:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
memor yes Pinkerton
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
and Pinkerton and C Brown from my years
 
05:20:51.628 --> 05:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
at the department are considered public
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
private institutions now Pinkerton for
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
example has a a CTE Center so they have
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
in the past received State money for
 
05:21:02.190 --> 05:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
that Center because they're a Regional
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
Vocational Center but Pinkerton also
 
05:21:10.788 --> 05:21:10.798 align:start position:0%
takes students from Candia Auburn hamste
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's Hamstead there are
 
05:21:13.468 --> 05:21:13.478 align:start position:0%
a number of school districts that are
 
05:21:15.548 --> 05:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
transitioned into Pinkerton and they
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
have a Board of Trustees as does cob
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
Brown yeah it's an independent much like
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
St Johnsbury
 
05:21:24.830 --> 05:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
Academy another thing just to point out
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
as far as um if you go the route of
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
saying okay we want the law to be
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
consistent and we want publicy to be
 
05:21:33.310 --> 05:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
required to submit to u2s and we want
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
them to be punished it would be as far
 
05:21:38.390 --> 05:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
as punishing Pinkerton meaning
 
05:21:40.750 --> 05:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
withholding State funding they're not
 
05:21:43.390 --> 05:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
receiving adequacy so we can't punish
 
05:21:45.070 --> 05:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
Dairy if Derry does their
 
05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
do25 they're going to receive adequacy
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
but then Pinkerton doesn't do their doe
 
05:21:50.910 --> 05:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
25 we're not paying adequacy to
 
05:21:52.590 --> 05:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton so it would just be a
 
05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
mechanical issue where we can't punish
 
05:21:57.590 --> 05:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
for something Pinkerton didn't do or you
 
05:21:58.910 --> 05:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
could write a laot to do that but that's
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
under this structure that wouldn't be
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
how just you know Crossing ad publicy in
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
the top line that wouldn't change that
 
05:22:05.520 --> 05:22:06.590 align:start position:0%
the top line that wouldn't change that
accountability

05:22:06.590 --> 05:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
structure but just something to it's the
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's the how law currently is being
 
05:22:11.000 --> 05:22:12.868 align:start position:0%
it's the how law currently is being
implemented

05:22:12.868 --> 05:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
05:22:16.110 --> 05:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
so y further questions yes represent
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:22:19.070 --> 05:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:22:21.310 --> 05:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
question so do all the different
 
05:22:24.430 --> 05:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
communities that tuition to Pinkerton do
 
05:22:27.468 --> 05:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
individual Doe 25s
 
05:22:30.670 --> 05:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
correct and there's no composite one for
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
correct that's because it's an
 
05:22:38.230 --> 05:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
independent school it has a Board of
 
05:22:40.270 --> 05:22:40.280 align:start position:0%
Trustees it doesn't not have elected
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
officials and it's it's bankroll with
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
there by those initial people that
 
05:22:51.150 --> 05:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
contributed that
 
05:22:51.160 --> 05:22:53.548 align:start position:0%
contributed that
school

05:22:53.548 --> 05:22:53.558 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:22:56.190 --> 05:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
understand we went through the on that
 
05:22:58.750 --> 05:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
we looked at all its assets its revenues
 
05:23:00.670 --> 05:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
its expenditures and it came out
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
clean so it's it's functioning I think
 
05:23:06.628 --> 05:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
that was when Erica was on AR Erica Leon
 
05:23:08.270 --> 05:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
was the one that required that to come
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
in here and we did
 
05:23:16.230 --> 05:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
that yes rep on M I do believe that
 
05:23:19.070 --> 05:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm dating myself here but I do
 
05:23:21.430 --> 05:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe that in the late
 
05:23:24.468 --> 05:23:24.478 align:start position:0%
80s that the labor board did
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
indicate that Pinkerton and Cole Brown
 
05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
were in fact public
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
schools for the purpose of organizing
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
unions I do believe that they did that
 
05:23:38.270 --> 05:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
is a ruling that they did
 
05:23:40.030 --> 05:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
have yeah I believe they have the
 
05:23:42.350 --> 05:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
designation of being a public school um
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
but they're unique relative to most of
 
05:23:44.798 --> 05:23:45.510 align:start position:0%
but they're unique relative to most of
our

05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:23:50.190 --> 05:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
schools and Curr not retirement that's
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
right so if we're don't I'm going to
 
05:23:53.910 --> 05:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
move on to the adequacy section I'll
 
05:23:55.230 --> 05:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
just if there's any more questions on
 
05:23:58.510 --> 05:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes so the adequacy section um oh
 
05:24:00.468 --> 05:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
man uh back when hb2 and I don't even
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%
know if it was the house or the Senate
 
05:24:03.468 --> 05:24:03.478 align:start position:0%
but we changed the adequacy formula in
 
05:24:05.670 --> 05:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
the budget and I think it might have
 
05:24:07.868 --> 05:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
been the Senate phase but a lot of
 
05:24:09.150 --> 05:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
things were being moved around in the
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and there's two
 
05:24:14.430 --> 05:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
calculations to do adequacy so there's
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be we only use one but
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
there's supposed to be two calculations
 
05:24:19.750 --> 05:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's one for all
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities Who Um send out tuition
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
you don't operate a school you're
 
05:24:28.430 --> 05:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to do one calculation and for
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
all municipalities where they act any
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
municipality where they educate a
 
05:24:34.708 --> 05:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
student within their District public
 
05:24:38.628 --> 05:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
school um in any way um uh you're
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do a separate calculation
 
05:24:42.430 --> 05:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
and so the carv was supposed to be for
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
those districts that only send out
 
05:24:46.708 --> 05:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
students and do not operate a school
 
05:24:48.430 --> 05:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to do two calculations
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
do the regular adequacy calculation that
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
you've all been educated on and it was
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
was in hb2 and you're supposed to look
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
at what is their current expenditure
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
and then back out swept meaning what are
 
05:25:02.310 --> 05:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
they paying tuition back out swept and
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the variance is is going to be
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
their adequacy Grant and so essentially
 
05:25:09.910 --> 05:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a district school who has
 
05:25:12.468 --> 05:25:12.478 align:start position:0%
a tuition bill that is less than the
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy Grant and so if we are made
 
05:25:17.468 --> 05:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
informed that that is going on for
 
05:25:20.468 --> 05:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
example if some District informed us if
 
05:25:21.910 --> 05:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
we found out that a district was paying
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
tuition less than adequacy um we would
 
05:25:27.350 --> 05:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to attempt to do that calculation
 
05:25:28.868 --> 05:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
um currently I'm not doing that
 
05:25:30.310 --> 05:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
calculation because I'm not aware of any
 
05:25:32.230 --> 05:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
District that has a tuition bill that's
 
05:25:35.390 --> 05:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
less than adequacy um so at the moment
 
05:25:39.070 --> 05:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's not really being implemented um but
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
when we took that language out when we
 
05:25:43.390 --> 05:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
took out that second calculation there
 
05:25:45.430 --> 05:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
was an error in the law where basically
 
05:25:48.430 --> 05:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
it says only calculate adequacy for
 
05:25:50.708 --> 05:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
districts that educate students in house
 
05:25:53.708 --> 05:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
so basically the law as as HB as passed
 
05:25:57.070 --> 05:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
in hb2 it says only calcul adequacy for
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
communities that educate students and so
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative fellows noticed that
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
error and she informed us and she put it
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
into this bill so um that is another
 
05:26:08.670 --> 05:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
housekeeping it it's not going to have
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
any fiscal impact because we are
 
05:26:11.708 --> 05:26:11.718 align:start position:0%
currently paying adequacy as
 
05:26:13.948 --> 05:26:13.958 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required um to
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
districts that educate students even if
 
05:26:18.948 --> 05:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
it's all through tuition um so we're not
 
05:26:20.510 --> 05:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
really following the plain meaning of
 
05:26:22.868 --> 05:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
the law because it would result in um
 
05:26:24.788 --> 05:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
essentially like defunding Albany which
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do um so that needs to
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
get fixed
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:36.788 --> 05:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
bill any
 
05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions anybody need the cliff
 
05:26:40.440 --> 05:26:41.990 align:start position:0%
questions anybody need the cliff
notes

05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
notes
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Mark thank
 
05:26:48.628 --> 05:26:48.638 align:start position:0%
you and we have let's see no other cards
 
05:26:49.990 --> 05:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
for that bill so we're going to close
 
05:26:52.670 --> 05:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
down 1265 and that's the last bill for
 
05:27:24.110 --> 05:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:24.120 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
okay
