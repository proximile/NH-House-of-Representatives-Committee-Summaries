00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
hello good morning everyone you can see
 
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
that we are a subcommittee of
 
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
two our numbers have been uh reduced but
 
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
nonetheless representative Gibbons and I
 
00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
are here I'm representative Peter
 
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
Petrino from Milford and I serve as the
 
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
clerk on children and family law and I
 
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
made the interim study motion uh for uh
 
00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 align:start position:0%
this house bill that we're looking at
 
00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
1269 uh representative Gibbons you want
 
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
to just say a quick hello hi I'm
 
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons from Manchester
 
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm the sub the co-chair of
 
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee of
 
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
two there we go well House Bill 12 69 uh
 
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
which was um the sponsor was
 
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative MCU from from meramac
 
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
called for um Visual and auditory
 
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
recordings of uh the use of restraint
 
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
and seclusions for students who have
 
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
IEPs and uh personally I found that
 
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 align:start position:0%
somewhat problematic because the way uh
 
00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
it was proposed to me it seemed like
 
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
there'd have to be uh video cameras in
 
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
every single classroom uh in every
 
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
school throughout the state which I felt
 
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
was somewhat of an invasion of privacy
 
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
not to mention uh incredibly costly but
 
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
listening to the concerns of parents who
 
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
testified uh it was heartfelt and I
 
00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
thought that it deserved uh some further
 
00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh attention so um last time we met was
 
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
on September 4th and we had Miss Moren
 
00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
Tracy who was a disability and civil
 
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
rights uh Advocate from marac New
 
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and she spoke uh to us
 
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
um about um the use of cameras she
 
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
thinks uh for accountability purposes
 
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
but also she made reference to a law in
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
Maine which also deals with this issue
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
previously I thought there wasn't really
 
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
much difference between uh the main
 
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
statute and and what we have here in New
 
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but upon further um
 
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
investigation the the statute in Maine
 
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
clearly prohibits uh the use of
 
00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion and and uh it
 
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
says here that um a cover entity that
 
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
receives state or federal assistance may
 
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
not subject a student to unlawful
 
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
seclusion or restraint this is the main
 
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
legislation uh
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
statute and they Define um seclusion or
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
restraint to mean unlawful seclusion or
 
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
restraint to mean simply seclusion
 
00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
mechanical restraint chemical restraint
 
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
physical restraint or physical escorting
 
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 align:start position:0%
a student that might um be be a risk to
 
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
their uh to their health and safety now
 
00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire our statute does
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
permit uh for limited use of restraint
 
00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 align:start position:0%
and so there's the big difference is
 
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does allow for it but
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
limited and uh what is prohibited in New
 
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the dangerous uh restraint
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
techniques so there we have some some
 
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
differences um in our discussion last
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
time uh there was um one suggestion that
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh possibly body cameras be used uh it
 
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
was representative Gibbons who
 
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
acknowledg that uh it would have to be
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
something that someone would turn on and
 
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
in the event of um something that's
 
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
happening that's you know quite
 
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
emotional and out of control uh the
 
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 align:start position:0%
individual may not remember to put the
 
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
body camera on so that was somewhat
 
00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
problematic if I
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
recall let me go ahead I just want to
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
interject I think it was in I don't want
 
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
to I don't want to put words incorrectly
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
in the in people's mouths but I think it
 
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
might have been rep D Simone who thought
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
that th this might be a cost-saving
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
effort um if they wore the body cameras
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
my concern was like if people would
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
forget like like rep uh Peto mentioned
 
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
that they that there's just so much
 
00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
going on in the moment that they might
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
forget to turn it on or if they just
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to be held accountable then
 
00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
they might maliciously not turn it on so
 
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
either one of those situations and and
 
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible to tell which one
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
um because we can't get inside other
 
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
people's minds so like did they forget
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
or did they purposefully not turn it on
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
no way to to ever know that exactly
 
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
exactly uh representative Nelson uh said
 
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
that her research showed that three
 
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
states do use surveillance cameras but
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
only in special ed classrooms and she
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
had said that four other states had
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
bills uh however they did not pass and
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
then of course there was the concern
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
about funding representative Nelson
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned that Texas in particular based
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
on her research has been using federal
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
funds uh in Grants for surveillance
 
00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.110 align:start position:0%
funds uh in Grants for surveillance
cameras

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
there um all of that being said we uh
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
adjourned because we were anxious to
 
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
view a
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
documentary uh which some of us did see
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
this past Monday uh the 23rd uh the
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
documentary titled the kids we lose and
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
that was from the lives uh
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
inbalance which uh is um Dr Ross Green
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
who's the founder and director of uh uh
 
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
the lives and balance and and the
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
documentary really just uh focused on a
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
number of uh young children with
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral challenges which was a
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
struggle not only for them but for the
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
parents and for the Educators and staff
 
00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
and how uh typically these children are
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
restrained and secluded in such ways
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
that are considered to be brutal and
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
inhumane so Dr um Green's approach um he
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
calls it a collaborative proactive
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
solution CPS that his uh group lives in
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
the balance is promoting as a way of
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
educating uh trainer uh educate excuse
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
me to train
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
Educators so there were a lot of
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions that had after I wish we had
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
more of the panel here who who who saw
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
it because I like to get their
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
Impressions the documentary was hotf
 
00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 align:start position:0%
felt but it did not really focus in on
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
how to address it it just focused on
 
00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
what the problem was I would have liked
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
to have seen um Dr Green's uh approach
 
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
utilized I'd like to see some data to
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
see how effective it is in the panel
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
discussion there was talk about other
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh methodologies that
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
could be used but those other uh
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
programs were not identified so I do
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
have a lot of questions in that regard
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh but definitely it's something for us
 
00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
to explore
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
further so let's
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
see so going
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
forward what I what I see basically are
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
we can continue with the New Hampshire
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
statute which would allow for The
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
Limited use with some cameras maybe in
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
designated seclusion areas as one
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
possibility but definitely with teacher
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
training that's one option or another
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
option might be to consider what Maine
 
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
has done and that would be to completely
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
prohibit um restraint and seclusion but
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
again with um with uh significant
 
00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.390 align:start position:0%
again with um with uh significant
teacher

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
training um training doesn't have to be
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
in work uh in in in-house workshops at
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
school districts I was thinking that
 
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
this might be something that even the
 
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
colleges could apply uh in their teacher
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
training programs maybe it could be
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
something that could be put into a
 
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.629 align:start position:0%
something that could be put into a
certification

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
requirements uh but clearly we need some
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
data as the effectiveness of these
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
programs because otherwise we're just
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
taking a shot in the dock so some talk
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
about maybe a trial program uh have a
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
school district incorporate uh the
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
methodologies of uh Dr Green or some
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
other alternative method apply them see
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
if they are in fact uh
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
effective and uh we're also waiting to
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
hear back from the office of child
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
advocate because I believe they may also
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
have some proposals for us to to
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
consider as well
 
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
so basically in conclusion that those
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
are my observations and we've done you
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
know we've looked at this in great
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
detail and um we're just going to have
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
to wait and see whether or not we're
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
going to file some legislation and
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much where we're at so a
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
long summation on my part and um do you
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
have anything to
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
add well we always want to erir on doing
 
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
the least harm you know so we don't want
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
to do any harm um I
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
personally always prefer not oh yay r d
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
Simon is here um I always prefer less
 
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.750 align:start position:0%
Simon is here um I always prefer less
restrictive

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
means um and and training so you know
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
what whoever was I I don't remember who
 
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
was at the mic uh at the last uh
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
Committee subcommittee hearing that we
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
had uh but she was mentioning that they
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
they often will take like try to model a
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
medical approach and most medical
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
facilities will encourage the least
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
restrictive means possible and only do
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
restraining if it's like incredible
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
necessary and get them out of restraints
 
00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible um and we'll also
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
train staff on deescalation
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
techniques uh some some hospitals call
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
it Moab uh management of aggressive
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
behavior uh so I would always favor that
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
before just restraining somebody because
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
someone can get hurt when you try to
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
restrain someone whether the staff
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
person or the um in this case student
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
um and also it can it can up aggressive
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
behavior you know if you try to imagine
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
your self in restraints of any kind your
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
your natural uh inner psyche wants to
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
get out of that so um so something that
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
could maybe have been managed by talking
 
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
to them it now becomes talking to them
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
and trying them trying to get out of
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
their strain itself so that being said
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know these are students who are at
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh the best solution is always
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
prevention always so
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
um but but when you get to the point of
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
no return like sometimes you do have to
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
restrain so I'm a little bit torn on I
 
00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
also I don't also don't favor doing
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
something without data cuz then you're
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
technically experimenting on humans so
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
so um um I do have share the same
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that you brought up where where
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
the research just kind of tell
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
identifies the problem but doesn't
 
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
identify a solution so but repd Simone
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
is here so so let's uh get her opinions
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely so again the New
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute uh does allow for the
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
proper uses of restraint and that's part
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
of the language in the U the RSA but
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
that what is prohibited uh is any type
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
of restraint which is d dangerous and
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
there may be times when a situation
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
happens and there needs to be immediate
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
action so we're not really sure about a
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
complete prohibition it's a very
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
delicate matter but uh rep DeSimone you
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
attended the um documentary and do you
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
saw thank you Mr chairman and I
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late there
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
was dead stop traffic on the
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
highway I I so I do apologize for that
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to the people who came
 
00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:39.150 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to the people who came
here

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we're in a situation
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
where um in in representative Gibbons is
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
aware of it in the on the medical end in
 
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.509 align:start position:0%
aware of it in the on the medical end in
the

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh where uh people have mental
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
that create a a scenario where they
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.189 --> 00:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
restrained the RSA was carefully
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
constructed to say the word
 
00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
proper instead of being specific in the
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
type it said proper
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
restraint so the people who are involved
 
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the actual action that is going to
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
constitute um any restraints being used
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
are the ones who have to discern what is
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
and is not proper at that time and I
 
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
think that those people need
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
guidance to figure that out um everybody
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
in a situation where restraints are
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
going to be used uh as the documentary
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
talked about and as I have seen per on a
 
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.629 align:start position:0%
talked about and as I have seen per on a
personal

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
level uh everybody's
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
um demeanor is
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
heightened they want to quell the
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
situation as soon as humanly possible
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
without anybody getting
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
restraints unfortunately are a necessary
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
evil so we have to make sure that we
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
take the as much of the evil out of it
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that the people who
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be making the decision as
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
to whether to restrain or not and whatp
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
type of restraint will be
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
used are well
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
Tred that there is more than one person
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
scenario and the types of restraints are
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
available sometimes a seclusion room is
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
necessary sometimes that's not the case
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
so we have to be very careful with this
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and I am absolutely 100%
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
open to listening to all scenarios with
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation that will be coming
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
forward I'm
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
sure in the best interest of
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
child the committee of children and
 
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
family law was named appropriately
 
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
family law was named appropriately
because

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
children in my mind come
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
first uh we have to be sure that those
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
children are as safe as humanly possible
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it takes Extreme Measures
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
to do that so I'm looking forward to
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
some very good comprehensive legislation
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to protect these
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
kids uh and secondarily protect protect
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
the people who are trying to protect
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
these kids uh let's face it they get
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
kicked they get bit they get
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
hit the child may not mean to do that
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
but in the throws of whatever is
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
happening accidents happen so we need to
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
help these people be as well Tred as
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
possible to do their job in the best
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
child thank thank you very much I
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
thought that was well said uh speaking
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
only for myself at the moment I'm
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
currently leaning towards our current
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
statute which does allow for some
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
limited uh use of restraint and
 
00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
seclusion uh amending it possibly for
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
cameras only in seclusion areas
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
designated in seclusion areas rather
 
00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
than throughout the entire uh school and
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
definitely uh a focus us on teacher
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
training uh possibly a pilot program
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
using uh Dr Green's methodology or other
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based methods gather the data
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
to see if it's effective and then look
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
for ways that we can start to
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate that and teacher training
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
programs and throughout uh school
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
districts um I think that would be most
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate but that being said I'm
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
still waiting to hear back from the
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and their
 
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.950 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate and their
recommendations

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
but that's where I'm at at the moment
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
and as always we welcome more input
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
because the more input we have my mind
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
is always open to to shifting my
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
thoughts and my thinking on any matter
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
so please um you know uh assist us as we
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
all work together to do our best because
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
clearly this is a big problem and we
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
want to get it right so thank you very
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
much do we have any questions or
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
at the film also with some of you um
 
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
with Dr Green's methodology I just
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide a little bit of
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
information to the committee um I think
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
that you've really identified some
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
important areas to focus on in terms of
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
evidence-based interventions and
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
training that could be made available to
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
teachers to try to reduce the use of
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
restraint um as an intervention and also
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
seclusion um one of the things that
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
struck me about what little we learned
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
about Dr Green's intervention because we
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
didn't learn a whole lot did we on
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
Monday but what I what I took away from
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
it was this concept that um what needs
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
to happen is that the
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
Educators um and it's not just Educators
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
because you know we have children who
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
are restrained in facilities as well and
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
other programs so it's recognizing where
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
a child is struggling to meet
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
expectations and not let that behavior
 
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
and then teach them and work with them
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
before their behaviors escalate so I
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
think the example they gave was you know
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
a child who's you know can't has a hard
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
time come with the classroom rules or
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
with learning to read you try to do the
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
intervention early so that seemed like
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
that was that was my takeaway about what
 
00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
his methodology without without really
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
any real knowledge of it what I thought
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
it seemed like I just wanted to clarify
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
a couple things for the committee and
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
tell you where I think there might be um
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
additional areas to focus on going
 
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.510 align:start position:0%
additional areas to focus on going
forward

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire law does prohibit
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
restraint except in it's an emergency
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
intervention so um and and and Main law
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
actually does not is pretty similar so
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
in in terms of when it's prohibited and
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
what our current law says is that it's
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
only to be used to ensure the immediate
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
physical safety of persons when there is
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
a substantial and imminent risk of
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
serious bodily harm to the child or
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
others and this I'm looking at RSA 126 U
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
um colon 5 it also talks about how um
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
the determination should be made um and
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
I and that it should be only used by
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
trained Personnel using Extreme Caution
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
when all other interventions have failed
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
or been deemed inappropriate so um but
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
the the challenge though is that we know
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
restraint still happens we have this
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
black letter law which limits the use of
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
restraint to extreme emergency
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
situations but we see reports like they
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
come out like November 1st every year
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
you'll get a report from the Department
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
of Education and then from DHHS which
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
all it does though is summarize the
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
numbers of restraints that have occurred
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
that have been reported to them there's
 
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
really no Deep dive particularly from
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
the education side into whether these
 
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
restraints were proper whether the
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
people were in fact trained whether
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives were considered and
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
the department of of education has had
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much a hands-off approach to this
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
except for just collecting and Reporting
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
the data so another um strategy that
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
this committee might consider is either
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
is maybe um creating a position at the
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
office of the child advocate or some
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
other agency I think probably the OCA
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
would make sense because they work with
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
children who um all children not just
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
children who have IEPs this this
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
restraint law applies to all children
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
not just with IEPs but to have some
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
agency in the same way that OCA looks at
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
restraints that occur in facilities to
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
have them examine um restraints when
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
there are patterns that are coming
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
forward when we're seeing like high
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
numbers in a particular school for
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
example um that doesn't have a high CH
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
you know child population um and and
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
making some recommendations there and
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
spot checking so that would be one area
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
I mean for you all to consider um and
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
another would be what kind of REM ities
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
are available or investigations happen
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
when there is when there are allegations
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
that a child has been restrained
 
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
improperly So currently under current
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
law there is a um requirement that the
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and DHHS have a
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
complaint process and promulgate rules
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
for that um it it's it's not hugely
 
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and it's just an
 
00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
investigation and there aren't reporting
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
requirements so it's unclear whether
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
parents have a right to see the um
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
outcome whether the outcomes of these
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
all we know when all we get reported to
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
us is that there has been a complaint
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
and it's been resolved so we don't know
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
whether the resolution is there was a
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
problem that was identified and the and
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
the teacher school district is now under
 
00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
a corrective action plan does that even
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
happen there's not a lot of information
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
out there so another area to focus on
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
and I don't have all the answers would
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
be to look at what is what is the
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
complaint process how can we use the
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
complaint process to do two things one
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
um make sure that you know if a child is
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
subjected to a restraint that's improper
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
how to make that child whole you know
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
they might need counseling they might
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
need other supports there may be other
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
remedies um that I think are allowable
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
under current law but also how to ensure
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't happen again and that
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
teachers receive the training that they
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
need um that that you know if
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
administrators need to be involved that
 
00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
they are involved um but maybe look at
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
that aspect of our law also to hopefully
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
make that a little more robust so that
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
we can learn something from it going
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
forward so that's my more than two
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
sons well that was excellent I
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you very
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
much any questions well no I just wanted
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
to to feedback just everything they
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
bringing up is very valid um from my
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
experience like in the impatient side um
 
00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
we're always supposed to use the least
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
restrictive like I was saying and
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
and get them out as soon as possible and
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
train staff on proper usage and and
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
so um and like I was saying earlier like
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
deescalation techniques and early
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
intervention is is critical um in the
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
hospital setting so everything you're
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
bringing up here is extremely valid and
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
I would be on board with it
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you so much for your time
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
and attention it's really important
 
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.190 align:start position:0%
and attention it's really important
thank

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
thison thank you representative and and
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
for all the people out here I I was at
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
an event over the weekend and uh uh
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
couple of the people there were
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
Educators one of whom was a principal in
 
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.310 align:start position:0%
Educators one of whom was a principal in
another

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
state in a prompted conversation about
 
00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919 align:start position:0%
how life was 400 years ago when I was in
 
00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:58.590 align:start position:0%
how life was 400 years ago when I was in
school

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
and when these people became Educators
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
and then principls and they now
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
retired and we
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
have a long way to go in making sure
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
that these kids kept
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
safe but we've come a long way and it
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
prompted memories of when I was in
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
school and how when you were sent to the
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
principal's office on the wall
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
legitimately you may
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
remember there were paddles of all
 
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
different sizes and those were
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
used by
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
administrators and so forth and so
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
on um and I
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
remember that hanging on one of the
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
administrators you're going to gasp I
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
know coat rack was a straight jacket
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
so if you were totally out of
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
control you were put in the straight
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
jacket and you were sat in a chair in
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
the principal's office and you were not
 
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to move for x amount of
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
time um I'm really glad that those
 
00:26:18.269 --> 00:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
practices don't take place anymore um
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
but I do remember my younger brother
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
when he was in the second
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
grade came to my classroom I was in the
 
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.909 align:start position:0%
grade came to my classroom I was in the
fifth

00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
fifth
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
grade and he said to the teacher who was
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
a very large
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
man tall and and large and he said
 
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.590 align:start position:0%
man tall and and large and he said
excuse

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
me my teacher wants to see my sister and
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
the teacher ignored
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
him and my brother was just this little
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
guy and I'll never forget it because it
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
was on December 10th which was his
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
birthday and the teacher he said it a
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
second time he said it a third time he
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
said it a fourth time and the teacher
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
just ignored him
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
finally second grade remember he turned
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
and said hey
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
Fatso my teacher wants to see my
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
sister which at that point he got up
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
picked my brother up physically walked
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
out into the hallway shoved my brother
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
in a locker shot and locked the
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
door this this was a practice that was
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
common back in that
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
67 it was very common I'm thrilled that
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's never used I got into trouble
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
because I went to the desk and I pulled
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
the key out of his drawer unlocked the
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
locker and took my brother out and we
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
left the school and went
 
00:27:51.919 --> 00:27:53.590 align:start position:0%
left the school and went
home

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
um but the point is
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
I want in my heart of hearts to believe
 
00:28:04.029 --> 00:28:04.039 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't happen anymore I pray
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
with all my heart it doesn't happen
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
anymore and I do know we've come a long
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
way and I do know we have a long way to
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
go so I I I applaud everybody who has
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
become involved in this uh and and the
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
principles that I spoke with were were
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
saying y yeah that happened all the time
 
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
and blah blah blah blah blah you know it
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
was it's just crazy
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
crazy however we have to remember that
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's how parents
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
were so the school was only doing what
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
parents did at home and we still have
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
parents who are doing that at home so we
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful to understand
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
where these children come from why
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening to them is happening
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
why what they're doing is happening and
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
the good news is I just spoke to my
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
nephew on the way here blue
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
tooth and at at um
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton School District they're
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
opening uh they're building a new
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
building and most of that building is
 
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
going to be in use for children who have
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh a variety of learning disabilities
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
even to the point where there's going to
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
be a portion that's going to be built
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to look like an
 
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
apartment so that when the kids go into
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
this area they're taught life
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
skills and there's an observation desk
 
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
where the teachers and administrative
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
staff can observe these kids so again I
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
we've taken Leaps and Bounds and I'm
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
very excited to see how that particular
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
program um evolves in dairy uh it's it's
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
sounding like a fabulous my nephew has
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
uh his uh oldest daughter has um a
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
learning disability and he's very
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
excited he's been involved in looking at
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
the pilot programs and so forth so again
 
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
please know that we're working we're
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
working really really hard we're going
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
to get this done we're going to get it
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
done I believe in the best interest of
 
00:30:16.919 --> 00:30:18.549 align:start position:0%
done I believe in the best interest of
those

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
children thank you representative and
 
00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank goodness corporal punishment is
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
now uh outlawed in Most states in this
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
country which is a very good thing your
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
story actually made me recall a
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
situation that happened to me back in
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
first grade and I'm not sure if I should
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
put it on the record but it's a somewhat
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
funny story where apparently I got in
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
trouble and I don't recall what it was
 
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
that I did but the teacher decided to
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
bring me into the side room uh where the
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
paddle was and when we got in there she
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
said you know Peter I really don't want
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
to paddle you but I can't let the other
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
kids know that I didn't so what I'm
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to do is I'm going to get the
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
paddle and I'm going to hit the desk
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
over here so they can hear the impact
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
and you're going to Fain that you're
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
being hurt and when you walk back into
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
the classroom I want you to rub your
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
bottom like it really hurt and um I was
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
like that's a pretty good
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
deal so that's what happened and here I
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
was seven years old you know and I
 
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
walked back into the classroom rubbing
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
my bottom and all my classmates looked
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
in horror and uh that was that was the
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
story back then so I didn't get
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
spanked thank you thing but anyways
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at any other comments
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
down uh good morning Mr chair and
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak with you today uh
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Becky Wilson I am the
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
director of governmental relations for
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
Association prior to my work uh at the
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
school boards which I've been in for the
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
last 5 years or so I served as a special
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
education director um in the local
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
public District here in New Hampshire so
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
uh this issue is certainly something
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
that is near and dear to our hearts both
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
as uh Educators and also as local school
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
boards I just wanted to be sure that you
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
had the most current information to work
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
off of as you decide whether or not to
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
move forward with further legislation in
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
this area um in the 22 and 23 uh
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislative session there were two bills
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
that were passed that significantly
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
updated the restraint and seclusion law
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and that was
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 179 and House Bill 491 those
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
were both effective in the summer and
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
fall of 23 um they significantly updated
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements for
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusions for uh Public
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
Schools public charter schools public
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
acmy and approved non-public schools
 
00:32:54.629 --> 00:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
there is a 13 page um reporting form
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
that needs to be filled out by local
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
public schools or any of those schools I
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
just mentioned anytime there is a use of
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion it is very
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
detailed um it goes through every staff
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
member that was involved what their
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
training was prior to the restraint uh
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
any injuries that might have occurred uh
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
identifies a co-regulator for the
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
student a person that the student picks
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
um to help them through the process as
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
they're being deescalate that is based
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
off of the students perception of that
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
person being a positive person in their
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
life um it talks about what kinds of
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
programming the school district has um
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
used to train staff in those kinds of
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
things um and a lot of that work that
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
you mentioned previously that was part
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
of the film that you watched um Dr
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
Cassie yakle has worked with a number of
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
districts in this state on uh
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
trauma-formed practices and working on
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
those things as a entire District so not
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
just staff that are working with
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
students who maybe have a propensity to
 
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
need more just deescalation but with all
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
students um the department of Ed the
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
office of Social and emotional Wellness
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
could give you a list of what districts
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
have worked with uh the department and
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
what kinds of programs or expertise in
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
that area that they've been working on
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for several years
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to make sure that
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
you knew when you get those restraint
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
and seclusion reports from the
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed that has simply just
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the school and the number of restraints
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and seclusions there is context
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
obviously that goes with that report um
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
we have schools again I think as
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone was just
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
mentioning that potentially have
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
targeted programs within a certain
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
building that addresses students who
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
potentially are disregulated more often
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
than others so those numbers may look
 
00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
higher on a piece of paper um it doesn't
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that it's because the
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
staff is more likely to restrain
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
students or seclude students it could be
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
um that they just have a higher
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
population of students who tend to be
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
disregulated more often and need more
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
deescalation so there's a lot of context
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
within that uh so as you decide whether
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
or not to move forward with further
 
00:34:59.470 --> 00:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
legislation I just wanted to make sure
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
that you knew that uh that information
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
is available on the department of Ed
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
website their technical advisory about
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
the restraint and seclusion Report Form
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
um how it needs to be completed Etc um
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
and really detailed descriptions of what
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
counts as a restraint or seclusion here
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
in the state and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much I
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that information do you
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
happen to have uh any uh thoughts about
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh moving forward beyond the legislation
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned um thank you for
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
the question uh I prior to working in a
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
public District very long ago um in the
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
late 80s and early 90s I worked in a
 
00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility for
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
students with neurobehavioral disorders
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
um and I think as representative D
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
Simone had mentioned things have changed
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um over the last 30 years or
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
so in terms of people's perceptions of
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion and when to use
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
it and when not to the new the law the
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
way that it is written now is very clear
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
about um when to intervene physically
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
with a student in terms of what is
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
considered imminent harm or imminent
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
danger to other students as well um I
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
think you it would benefit the greater
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
committee potentially to look at um some
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the challenges that I think you
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
probably saw reflected in the film of
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
public schools or you trying to figure
 
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
out what is the right what is the best
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
way to create a climate in which all
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
students feel they belong in our public
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
schools and all students are accepted in
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
that way um because I think and again
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is my person this has nothing to do
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
with the school boards Association this
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
is my own personal belief but uh when
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
kids are broken and feeling like they
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
don't belong that is when you start to
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
you it it doesn't help the situation at
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
all so I think the more you can create
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
communities where everyone belongs the
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
more of the less chance you have of
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
students feeling um you know that they
 
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
that they don't have a way to regulate
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
themselves you have some people sitting
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
behind me who work in a variety of
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
public schools and non-public school
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
settings who are very experienced in uh
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
trying to help students learn better
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
coping mechanisms and better ways to
 
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
manage uh but it really is a whole
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
district and a whole school approach it
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
is not about
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
individual um Behavior plans in the way
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
that it used to be in the past where
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
people would certainly just write a
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
behavior plan um which was about how the
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
students were going to change and not
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
about how other people in that person's
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
life could change change to help the
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
student also change that's my personal
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
statement that is not on behalf of the
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
School Board Association very good yes
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
and as a former High School teacher of
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
40 years I fully agree with you that
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
school has to be a place where every
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
student feels valued and welcome it
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be a safe place the legislation
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
before us that has us here right now
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
calls for the use of surveillance
 
00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
cameras for students with IEPs now of
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
course students with IEPs are
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
mainstreamed so my thinking is you'd
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
have to have cameras in every single
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
classroom throughout the buildings of
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
every school what are your thoughts
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
about surveillance cameras that was the
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
legislation that's before us thank you
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
for the question and just to clarify too
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
I think there was some discussion
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
earlier about Hospital settings but the
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
original bill that was proposed was
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
simply just for public schools correct
 
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:20.200 align:start position:0%
so uh local public districts already
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
have audio surveillance in some areas of
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
their schools as well as school buses to
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
some extent um every school board has to
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
have a policy about their surveillance
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
and how that is maintained um how long
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
is the record kept who can see the
 
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
record is it part of 91a Etc um this
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
would expand that quite a bit for local
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
public districts there certainly would
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal impact at the local level in
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to figure out um what
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
technology would be needed to what
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
extent um if you take the current law as
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
it is and people are using restraint in
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
those situations that are of imminent
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
danger um it would be difficult I I
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
think to think about how to manage that
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of it being on or off at a
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
given time I think in theory it would
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
just be on all of the time um I do share
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
the concern that I think that that might
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
be um something that would not be
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
tenable for a lot of local school
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
districts in terms of trying to just
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
maintain that level of surveillance for
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
lots of reasons technology access um
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
storage of that data what happens to the
 
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
data you're recording everyone not just
 
00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
those students necess necessarily um and
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
if students are being included in the
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment to the
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
maximum extent that is appropriate for
 
00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
them um a place like Pinkerton Academy I
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
mean that's a very large campus that
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
would Rec I don't know how you
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily would do it in that
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
particular way I can understand the
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
people's concern um and the committee's
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
concern about ensuring that anyone
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
participating in a restraint or
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
seclusion are doing that with Fidelity
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
to the law as it is currently written
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
and that there is a situation that
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
involves imminent danger and that those
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
people are are trained
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I don't necessarily see
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
that there is the abil that local public
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
districts or any of the people mentioned
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
in this current law so that would be
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
public academies non-public schools any
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
School charter schools would have the
 
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
ability necessarily to implement that at
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
the level at which people would feel it
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
was meeting the spirit of this law or
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you very much we have a
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
question question from um I just wanted
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
to clarify um we know that that we're
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
not that this that this legislation
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't infiltrate hospitals we know
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
that that it's only for the the schools
 
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
the reason why we were bringing up what
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
the hospitals do in the medical setting
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
um is because there was another Advocate
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
who mentioned that they like to look at
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
what the hospitals are doing be and then
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
not really deviate very far from that
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
because the hospitals are already basing
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
it on studies and things like that so
 
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
kind of like mimicking so to speak um
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
but we know that this legislation
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect the hospitals so thank
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification representative
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it anything
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
further representative yes thank you um
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
so to that end concerning the
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
surveillance cameras um I personally
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
have a problem with a surveillance
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
camera in a classroom surveilling every
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
single student every single moment of
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
every single day
 
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
however I also have a problem
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
with a child
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
who is in distress at any given time no
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
actual log of what created that child
 
00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
stress what was done
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
immediately prior to during and after
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
the incident so I I do think
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
that cameras should be available and
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
that was one of the reasons that I
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
brought up the discussion of um body
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
cameras for a teacher who may need
 
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
something like that again the
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
schools are restrict red
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
financially in many
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
ways but I think we need to be very
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
careful as to um being able to document
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens during a particular
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
incident so can you maybe give me some
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts about body cameras as opposed
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
to surveillance cameras thank you for
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
the question representative I do want to
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
point out on the um report that needs to
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
be filed on every incident of restraint
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
and seclusion by any of those entities I
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously there are three
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
pages that talk about what led to the
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
incident of restraint and reclusion um
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
there's a documented um you have to
 
00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:12.559 align:start position:0%
document what interventions or
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
deescalation techniques happened prior
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
to needing to use a restraint or
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
seclusion there's interventions um
 
00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
listed that you can pick from that
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
people need to be trained in prior to
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's a narrative of the justification
 
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
of why you used it um and what what you
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
might do differently uh whether or not a
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
child's behavior intervention plan has
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
been modified as a result of this
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
incident and if so when all the all so
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
those pieces that you're asking in terms
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
of um detailed information about an
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
incident of restraint and seclusion is
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
available to the people that serve on
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
that child's um intervention team and to
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
families so I just wanted to put your
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
mind at e that some of that information
 
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
that you're asking I believe is
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
available through these forms I don't
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
know if that it's obviously not public
 
00:43:58.990 --> 00:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
publicly available because it is
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
specific to a child um but for people
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
who sit on that child's team um it's a
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
very detailed form so anytime there was
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
a restraint or seclusion um this form
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
would need to be documented and it's
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
also filled and filed at the Department
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
of Education so there is some of that
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
information out there um you know I
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to speak to uh
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
individual local districts comfort with
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
body cameras or individual cameras there
 
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
are some
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
districts who may have a uh calm down
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
area or seclusion room for lack of a
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
better term um most places are getting
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
away from that to be perfectly honest um
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
I think you would find that there's a
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
number of places in the state including
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
residential uh treatment facilities and
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
schools that serve very high need
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
populations who don't have those areas
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
anymore they just manage the
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
deescalation in whatever environment the
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
child is in um so I can't speak to sort
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
of what people's Comfort are with
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
individual body cameras per se um in
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
those situations but I think if you're
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
looking for reassurance that there's
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of documentation of what is
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
happening what has led to it what
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
happened after that that may be
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
available to you through some of these
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
report forms that are already out there
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what how people would
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
feel individually or at individual
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
districts about body cameras per se
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
repres of Gibbons yeah I just I was just
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
wondering is there do you know if
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's a report filled out for every
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
time I know there's supposed to be a
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
report filled out for every time that uh
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
a restraint is used but are the are the
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
school districts actually doing that
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory and there was an extensive
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
amount of training that happened in 2023
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
when these were updated because uh there
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
was a lot of confusion about what needed
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
to be reported so if you simply hold a
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
child's hand is that considered a
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
restraint because you're restricting
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
movement per se so there was a lot of
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
training that happened because initially
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
when these changes went through the
 
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
department was getting a high amount of
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
reports because districts were reporting
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
everything um so to make sure that
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
people understood what was truly
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
considered a restraint versus what was
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
not was clarified by the department of
 
00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
Ed they put out a technical
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
advisory um on September 5 th of 23 to
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
really clarify that but yes those
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
reports are filed at the Department of
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
Education um and there are ways for the
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
Department to follow up on that if they
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
for any reason feel that that's not
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
happening or if there's any complaint
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
from a family um or student that felt
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
that maybe that wasn't being done that
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
there are ways for that to be remedied
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
department thank you very much you're
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you any other comments or
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts from from those uh in
 
00:46:55.119 --> 00:47:04.109 align:start position:0%
thoughts from from those uh in
attendance

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
much am I on now okay thank you
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
Representatives um my name is Jessica
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
Brown I'm the director of student
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
services at sa67 which is Bo and
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton um I thank you for the
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak with you today um I
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
do think that talking about the
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
surveillance cameras is the primary
 
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
focus of the legislation as you brought
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
up but I just first wanted to thank you
 
00:47:26.599 --> 00:47:27.630 align:start position:0%
up but I just first wanted to thank you
for

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
um considering the fact that the that
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
these um restraints and seclusions do
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes need to occur in these
 
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:35.559 align:start position:0%
emergency situations one of the things
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
that local school districts are tasks
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
with doing most importantly is keeping
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
all of our kids in our Public Schools um
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
that is the um sort of the sentiment
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
behind Ida right is the least
 
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment and being able
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
to have all options available to us to
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
be able to keep some of our high needs
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
kids in our Public Schools is really
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
important um and knowing that a lot of
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
the proactive strategies you're looking
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
at evidence-based solutions to staying
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
out of restraints and seclusions are
 
00:48:04.549 --> 00:48:04.559 align:start position:0%
things that school districts are doing
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
um and trying to make sure that we have
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
less of those experiences for kids um
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things I wanted to share with
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
you is sort of that personal experience
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
from the staff perspective that they are
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable situations to be in right
 
00:48:19.549 --> 00:48:19.559 align:start position:0%
um that that we certainly want to
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
protect kids and when staff show up to
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
these events um it it is it doesn't feel
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
good right like nobody wants to engage
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
in them so the more clarity from
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
practice from technical assistance from
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
the department and from legislation when
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
the rsa's come out is really helpful for
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
us from a practice Point um just so that
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
we know how to act in these certain
 
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
situations so the one thing that I did
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
kind of want to share related to the
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
surveillance and for consideration from
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
the committee in any future legislation
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
is to provide some of that guidance
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
around those things um and to consider
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
student dignity component so I think one
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
of the things when I read that initially
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
that I thought was um you know a lot of
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
kids being on social media and things
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
like that like them creating their
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
digital footprint and what would that
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
look like for kids moving forward right
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
like when you're in when you're seven
 
00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
years old and you're having a hard day
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
and something like this happens who sees
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
that how is that shared what is the
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
intent of that surveillance um the same
 
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
way that the report that we have to now
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
fill out based off of the legislation
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
changes last year that report is
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
maintained in-house in districts um it
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
was written um and developed by the
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education but we don't we
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
don't send those reports to the
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Education currently we
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
maintain them in our local school
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
districts and they can be requested by
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education for review
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
but they're filled out at the building
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
level and then shared at the district
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
level so that we're aware of what
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
occurred and we can make plans to
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
prevent it from happening in the future
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I think that would
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
be important is who sees those um Visual
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
and audio things what are the what's the
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
intent of that if it's simply to um hold
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
people accountable like at a higher
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
level like you know being watched so
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to behave a certain way
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but if we're actually
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
going to use that data to make decisions
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that you're
 
00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
most concerned with is how does that
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
transpire so there's two pieces right
 
00:50:13.309 --> 00:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
like is the kid um hurt you want to have
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
documentation of whether or not anyone
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
gets hurt and I think cameras would
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish that but it I don't know if
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
cameras are going to catch the how did
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
it start part why did we get their part
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
and so if that's the piece that you're
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
trying to Target I do think the only way
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
to do that would be to have cameras
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere all the time and then all
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
those other pieces that you brought up
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
um would be things you'd want to
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
consider so I think the intent of the
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
cameras is something to consider what is
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
the aim of it there and then making
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
decisions and telling us kind of what
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
you want to see happen from that point
 
00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:46.799 align:start position:0%
Thank You representative Gibbons yeah I
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
think it's from my P from my
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
understanding it's all of the above that
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
they want to they want to
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
see if they're being properly used if
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
the escalation is being used prior to
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
and then also the documentation on if
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
anyone excuse me if anyone got hurt like
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
all those points that you brought up I
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
think is the intention
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative disimon
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and I think that your
 
00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
reference to the 91a um is is very
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
important so any legislation that can be
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
written um can be written in such a
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
manner as to be sure that none of that
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
information is available to anyone other
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
than the staff necessary to help that
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
child with their education process so I
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's a very important point
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for bringing that
 
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank you very much all
 
00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
right anyone
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you hello myby app turn on
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
your my name's Toby islen um I
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking the uh time to
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
listen to my thoughts on the subject I
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
also like to say I'm nervous I've never
 
00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
done this before so um I do have um just
 
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh some thoughts that I had put down on
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
paper to submit in writing if that's
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay but uh also just um addressing a
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of my background and why I'm
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
care about this matter um I am I'm from
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
malor New Hampshire I have kids in the
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
public school system very invested in
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
that I've also spent my professional
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
career working with students with
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
emotional and behavioral disabilities um
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
for the past 18 years um working with
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
children who come from very very
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
difficult circumstances and are
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
exhibiting some some really unsafe
 
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:48.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior towards them um themselves and
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
others over the last 18 years um as um
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
best practices have changed have changed
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
I've seen really wonder positive
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
movements in changes of practices and
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
training uh trauma-informed training um
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
ways to deescalate situations to
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
mitigate and avoid the use of restraint
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
um and and seclusion um that being said
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
what's been stated here there are
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances where there is that
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
imminent threat to self or others where
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to get seriously hurt
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
or at times um somebody's life is on the
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
line such as a kid running into traffic
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
um trying to hurt thems or kill
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
themselves that restraints are sometimes
 
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
necessary um I work in a residential
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
school uh with boys uh for with boys
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
with emotional and behavioral
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and um we our main goal is
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
to reduce and eliminate the use of
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
restraint it's an agency Mission it's
 
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
our schools mission to do this and we
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
have committees set up for it and we're
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
regularly reviewing what we can do to
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
reduce and eliminate the use of
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
restraints um I also want to state that
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
they we do um as far as the oversight
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
and Reporting requirements um part of it
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
is we do need to have an administrator
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
review of every time there is a
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion that we do and
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
document it every time there is a use of
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion the student is
 
00:54:15.069 --> 00:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
checked out by the nurse um uh to to
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
document any injuries and note that so
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
if there is any nit checking to see if
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
anything improper was done and those
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
pieces of it are following through um we
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
are meeting regularly with the staff
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
members um after a a hold to see what we
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
could have done differently what are we
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
going to do NE next time to reduce it
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
and eliminate it um some of the the the
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
fears that I have if we make it more
 
00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
difficult for educators to to handle
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
unsafe behaviors is what happens to
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
students if schools do take a hands-off
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
approach over the years we've had many
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
students come to us in a resident plac
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
residentially with us because the school
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
districts they they go to have taken
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
away the ability for staff to utilize
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
restraint techniques that means the
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
students who might have been held once
 
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
or twice in a public school are going to
 
00:55:08.349 --> 00:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
be placed residentially in an outof
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
District placement that is no longer the
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment in
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
manyways because they don't need
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
residential for other reasons except the
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
school district is unable to handle
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
their behaviors if this goes further
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
more to um other like residential
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
facilities too and and our ability to
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
Keep Kids Safe um it it is uh is
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
hampered then there's more likelihood
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
for students to be sent out of state um
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
further removing them from their
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
communities and ways to get back home we
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
have a student right now he's he's a
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
young man who's been struggling for
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
years and that's the question like can
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
he stay in state or can he go out of
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
state due to the unsafe behaviors and
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
something that that we're working with
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
to develop ways we're having meetings
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
all the time what can we do trying
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
different stuff um having observ and
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
interventions and assessments to what
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
else can we do to reduce the use of
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
restraint because the next step is going
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
away where he's not going to be able to
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
see his mom every weekend like he
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
currently does and how long is he going
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
to be out of state so there there is
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
that piece about what can we do to also
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
keep kids as close to communities that
 
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
um I really feel passionate about and
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
important for kids as well I know that
 
00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
we have gotten kids um who from from
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
like theyve been placed out of New
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in other in other states
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
because of their behaviors are so
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
extreme that even out of District
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
placements in New Hampshire are unable
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
to work with them safely there's a lot
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
of really on like I think New Hampshire
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
has done a really good job with some of
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
the oversight and the laws that they've
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
been put into place to um Keep Kids Safe
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
and that's not true in every state and
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of situations where
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
kids are coming back to us where they
 
00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
were placed out of District put in
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
really unsafe situations where they
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
experienced a lot of
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
trauma because their behaviors weren't
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
able to be kept safe in New Hampshire so
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
I I hope that as legislation is being
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
considered some of those some of those
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
aspects are considered and would really
 
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
I I mean I welcome oversight some of the
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
really positive things that have come
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years that are
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
initially a little nerve-wracking you
 
00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
know being an administrator in a school
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
working with kids who are exhibiting
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
unsafe behaviors are the oversight of
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
the disability um Advocates coming in um
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
and interviewing kids they come in
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
regularly and they interview any kid
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
who's willing to talk to them they ask
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
them about restraints how they're
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
utilized if they're utilized properly
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's a private conversation between them
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
without our staff there for that
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
oversight to ensure that kids voices are
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
heard and they do have the ability to
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
talk to somebody um if if they do feel
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
like anything improper has happened so
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
um I do welcome oversight as much as
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
possible with also understanding that
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
some of the behaviors and the mental
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
health issues that kids are struggling
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
with um these days is is pretty profound
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
and um disturbing and many cases because
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
you really feel for these kids that are
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
unable to keep themselves safe and are
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
trying to harm themselves and
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
others thank you very much it sounds
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
like you're doing fantastic work thank
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
you so much um are you using a
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
prescribed methodology evidence-based
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes that and is that something that you
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
can speak to is is it Dr Green program
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
or something similar so in order to all
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
staff who engage in um any restraint
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
techniques who go Hands-On and all sta
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
it's our policy that all staff are
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
trained in it are trained in right now
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're um work with a Crisis Prevention
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
Institute for nonviolent um Crisis
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
Intervention as well as uh TCI training
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so those are the the trainings that
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
our staff have and they all have
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
extensive um deescalation and Trauma
 
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
informed training as a part of them in
 
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:51.039 align:start position:0%
fact that's the majority of both
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
trainings are ways to reduce be
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
proactive um to ensure that students um
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
are being taught competencies of how to
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
deescalate staff are taught competencies
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
on how to deescalate to mitigate those
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
I've been um a a trainer for CPI for I
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
think 12 years now it's changed
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
dramatically since I first became a a
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
licensed trainer where the as far as
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
where the focus when I first started was
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
on how to restrain students and keep
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
them safe over the last um decade it's
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
moved into trauma-informed approach
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
where almost the entire like the most of
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
the training it's expanded a length of
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
time where it used to be 8 hours now
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's 22 hours as far as the training
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
goes um and the majority of that is
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
focused on trauma informed care and how
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
to deescalate situations and then how to
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
repair situations and Learn and Grow
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
from them if a situation does occur yes
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
they do teach how to and then another
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
emphasis has been put on um
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
disengagement techniques so if a student
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
is unsafe and they are attacking a staff
 
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
what can you do first to try to deflect
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
the blow or the strike try to uh take
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
away objects in the room that to make it
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
safe so really focusing on all ways to
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
reduce um the need to restrain in in
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
safer ways before going Hands-On because
 
01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
the the and the and that goes with the
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire is it really is
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
imminent risk to Serious bodily injury
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
to sell for others so that doesn't mean
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
throw a pencil at you that means serious
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
bodily injury means somebody could have
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
to go a hospital for a broken bone or
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
something like it at the very least so
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
it is and and that's changed a lot and
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
so the focus on the training has changed
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
significantly they're re um I have to
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
get recertified as a trainer every two
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
years and every two years they're upping
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
the training and it's different for the
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
best practices and techniques that
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're using um not only to update the
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
holds to try to make them ensure that
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
they're not traumatic cuz some of them
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
when I first started they're different
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
and so they're uh then they were and
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
they say that could be traumatic for
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
some individuals so they're making those
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments both to the holding
 
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
techniques but also the proactive
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
deescalation techniques and then also
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
the the followup to prevent it from
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
happening in the future and the the the
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
training and learning that occurs and
 
01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's true of the TCI training that we
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
also utilize however um I'm not the
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
trainer for that well thank you thank
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
you very much uh for the record uh could
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
you spell your last name for me yes i s
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
l i
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
n okay very good and would you be
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
willing to just hang back uh briefly
 
01:01:32.309 --> 01:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
after we um adjourn so I can talk to you
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
a bit more sounds like what you're doing
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
is is wonderful it's what we're looking
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
for and we're always looking for ways to
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
improve so again that's the thing as far
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
as legislation goes I welcome
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislation that can provide more
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
oversight and ways to continue to move
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
forward because I think you said it best
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
like we've come a long ways but we still
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
have a long way to go I think you said
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
that and and we're learning all the time
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
um there are just a one pie on the
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
cameras that I don't know what the best
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
answer is for this but I do I did want
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
to say that we have you know students
 
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
who have a lot of that guilt and shame a
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
lot of the time they don't want their
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
pictures taken one of the things that we
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
do at our school is we do something
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
called Sparkling moments every week
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
where we um capture students in the
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
moment doing stuff that's fun so that we
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
can put it into a report and send it to
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
their fam so like their their
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
residentially place they don't see them
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
all the time see what they're doing in
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
the classroom what they're doing in the
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
wood shop what they're doing like
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
catching a fish or go row boating and
 
01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing to see them in the
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
moment what they're doing there's some
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
students who we can't take their
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
pictures because they feel so much they
 
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
they they will escalate really quickly
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
and become unsafe we've had students who
 
01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
have come to us from other facilities
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
that do have cameras in place and the
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
students have talked about how they're
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
so relieved that we don't because of the
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
trauma and shame that they felt that's
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
not across the board many of our
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
students love to have their pictures
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
taken many of our students let love all
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
of that and would love but I just that
 
01:02:59.390 --> 01:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
that as far as a consideration that
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
there are some students that to that
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
dignity shame embarrassment peace or for
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
whatever reason really don't want their
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
picture taken their audio recorded
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
Etc representative Gibbons you had a
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
question or comment I did but he but he
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
touched on it so so we're good
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative Doone anything to add no
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right and any
 
01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much all right and any
other

01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
comments okay hearing none we have some
 
01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
work to do so with that I guess we'll
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
adjourn and thank you very much for
 
01:03:31.799 --> 01:03:54.710 align:start position:0%
adjourn and thank you very much for
being

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:24.710 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
