the across theall I'm gonna be there for
 
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit I just request that when
 
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
you come back in if someone is speaking
 
00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
wait until
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:08.230 align:start position:0%
wait until
they

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
good morning uh environment and
 
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
seats I'd like to start off our morning
 
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 align:start position:0%
with uh the Pledge of
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.630 align:start position:0%
 
smart

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
aliance to the flag of the United States
 
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
of America and to the Republic for which
 
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
it stands one nation under God
 
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
all before we start with our hearing i'
 
00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
just like to
 
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
um do a couple of little housekeeping
 
00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
things um number one I'd like to remind
 
00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that when people
 
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
are speaking uh and and giving their
 
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that if you need to leave the
 
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
room or come back into the room and sit
 
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
in your seat um it's appreciated if you
 
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
wait until the person who is speaking is
 
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
done because we don't we want to
 
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
minimize the amount of distraction um
 
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
and uh just as a matter of courtesy so I
 
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
realize that there are times that we
 
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
must get up and leave the room for
 
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
whatever reason um but when you are
 
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
getting up from your seat or returning
 
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
to your seat please um respect that the
 
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
person uh is
 
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
speaking the other thing I wanted to um
 
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
just remind the committee as a member of
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
as a as a point of
 
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
decorum is that um people when they come
 
00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.750 align:start position:0%
decorum is that um people when they come
to

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.190 align:start position:0%
to
testify

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
we uh are here to listen to what they
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
have to say and our our purpose is not
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
to get into a situation where we are
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
arguing with them and um so I I would
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that people um keep in mind
 
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
that we are here to listen to testimony
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
and not refute it uh certainly when we
 
00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
are asking our
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
questions um also to be mindful that
 
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
um our questions should not be any kind
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
of leading questions at all um they
 
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
should just be uh
 
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
very quick and to the
 
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.350 align:start position:0%
very quick and to the
point

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
um and other than that um
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
I know that we have a very full calendar
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
coming up uh within the next month we've
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
got a lot of bills to get
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
through and I think that there may be
 
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
instances where we may have to meet
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
twice a week instead of once a
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
week I'm interested to know from the
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
committee you don't have to tell me
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
right now but uh
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
just aside um during the day when we
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
have breaks or
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
whatever um is it better for you to come
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
say a Monday Tuesday or a Tuesday
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or are there any Are there
 
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
specific days of the week that are
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
not um amenable to you for whatever
 
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
reason you know maybe you have
 
00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
um a job or something
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
that other things that are going on in
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
your life but um we we will have to have
 
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh some instances maybe two or three
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
times where we will uh need to have a
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
second day during the week to
 
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate um work sessions or exec
 
00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
sessions um
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
and I think I think that's pretty much
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
all I wanted to cover um before we we
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
get into our
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
um into our hearings this morning
 
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.830 align:start position:0%
um into our hearings this morning
representative

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
smart thank you madam chair um I guess I
 
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
just want to apologize to anybody for
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
last week if I embarrassed any of my
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues I'm sorry um C was not my
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
intent I was just trying to get an
 
00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 align:start position:0%
answer so sorry sure thank you for your
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
apology appreciate
 
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
it um and I guess with that uh we can
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
proceed with our uh with our hearings
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
this morning so I would like to open up
 
00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
the hearing for hb1
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
1572 which is prohibiting using R mRNA
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
technology in food and requiring the
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
labeling of lab grown me meat and food
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
containing insects and here with us this
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
grion oh and also I'd like to remind
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
anybody to please silence their
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
phones thank you good morning
 
00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 align:start position:0%
representative gson and um welcome to
 
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
environment agriculture good morning
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'll put on my spectacle so
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
maybe I could see everybody over there
 
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
oh wrong ones those are my reading
 
00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:36.759 align:start position:0%
glasses so I'll turn on my bionic eye
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
this morning everyone's way over there
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh good morning uh Madam chair members
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee I am representative
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
Jeff gon from Grafton County 6 I
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Wentworth rumney
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
and Orford and I here to introduce House
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 1572 to you this bill addresses
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
three areas related to food safety uh
 
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
one is the use of mRNA mRNA or messenger
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
RNA technology in food the second is lab
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
grown meat and the third is insects as
 
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
food uh in addressing mRNA technology
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
and food the idea of edible vaccines is
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
not a new idea but it has only been
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
recently with the invention of mRNA
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
technology or the use in vaccines uh has
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
this become more of a
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
possibility in reality mRNA vaccines are
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
not traditional vaccines and really
 
00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:42.919 align:start position:0%
aren't even vaccines they are gene
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
therapy because instead of introducing
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
in a in an
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
injection the a sample of a
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
virus the
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
Mr is injected into a person and the
 
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
MRNA goes into to the cells and teaches
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
the cell to produce the spike protein or
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
the the virus that it will then combat
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
to provide the the immunity so your body
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
becomes the producer of the
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
antibody and the the the
 
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
immunization and so this idea of an
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
edible vaccine would be the the vacine
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
the MRNA would be injected into the food
 
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
supply either into cattle or uh pigs or
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
the the meat Source or through a genetic
 
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
modification of plant cells so you would
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
get it eating your lettuce or your
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
arugula or eating your cow either one
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
you would get
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and so you this is not about
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines in particular it just
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
happens to be this mRNA Tech technology
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
came about became popularized or or
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
became part of our our daily uh lexicon
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
with the invention of the MRNA mRNA
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines used for covid but now it as it
 
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
supply this
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
technology while it seems pretty
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
wonderful does have its side effects and
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
they they all
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
as more and more studies are
 
00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrating they they are actually
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
pretty dangerous they're pretty
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
hazardous we know now that mRNA produces
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
a spike is related to to covid anyway it
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
produces the spike protein but
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that Spike protein is not
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
limited to just the area in the
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
immediate vicinity of the injection site
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
that these these Spike proteins are
 
00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
either breaking loose or they're being
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
produced proded in other parts of the
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
body especially small blood vessels
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
which then trap blood in that blood
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
vessel causing blood clots there's also
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh myocarditis is a known side effect of
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
these mRNA
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh there then there's also the
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
link between the vaccine and what is
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
called long covid it's a Perpetual state
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
of Mala basically uh a flu like symptoms
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's a because your body becomes not
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
only the producer of the antibody but
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
also the immune response to to immunize
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
you your immune system is constantly
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
stressed and because of that
 
00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
overstressing it becomes weakened and so
 
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
you have this headaches all the time or
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
some weakness body so those are flu like
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
symptoms that just perpetuate and
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
they're calling that long covid but it
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
is a direct result of these
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
linked to I should say uh these these
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
mRNA vaccines so now when you introduce
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
that into the food supply one you're
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
doing it against people's knowledge
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps against their wishes somebody
 
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
who who's already been vaccinated for
 
00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
covid say uh doesn't need another
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
injection or doesn't want another uh uh
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination whatever somebody who has
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
not been vaccinated doesn't want the
 
00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine and we need to be able to
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
respect both parties but here if it's in
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
the if it's just done without knowledge
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
or without care with just disres
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
disregard for people's uh desires now
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
you are consuming something that you may
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
or may not want that may or may not
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
produce some kind of an effect how do
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
you then diagnose what the problem is
 
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519 align:start position:0%
and how it came about and so it opens
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's not only it's food
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
safety but it's also infringing upon
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.350 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
for the lab grown meat and the use of
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
insects in
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
food this bill does not do anything to
 
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
prohibit oh excuse me let me back up one
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit the use of mRNA
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
in the food
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
supply because it is not proven
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
technology it is or it has been proven
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
to not yet be safe enough to be injected
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
into our food supply
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a Prohibition against
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
mRNA for lab grown meat and insects as
 
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
food there's no prohibition against
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
either one uh if somebody wants to eat
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
lab grown meat and there are definitions
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
these definitions for lab grown meat uh
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
includes terms such as cultivated meat
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
or cell-based meat uh that is from the
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
actual Labs that are developing this
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
technology or what have you um
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
there so that you could see it by
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
different names but the point is you are
 
00:13:07.189 --> 00:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
free to eat what you want to
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
eat it just needs to be labeled what its
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
source is it's lab grown meat this is
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
not farmer Fred just slaughtered his his
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
herd and you're eating that and so that
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
is a very important distinction because
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
there is a more process involved and we
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
need to be able to know just like the
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the cattle yards have their
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
inspectors USDA inspectors these Labs
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
need to have inspections things that are
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
labeled as uh sourced outside the US
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
these need to have the labs being
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
sourced and this lab the only
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
restriction not only if there has to be
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
a label on the on the food that it is
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
lab grown but it also has to have the
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
information of where that lab is and no
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
Labs outside the United States and that
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
is for our own personal safety because
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
Wuhan as far as
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
insects this is beyond what the FDA
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
already allows for The Accidental
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
insects in your food already for those
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
of you who are not aware we eat bugs all
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
the time anyway uh but this would be
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
where an insect is actually an
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
ingredient in the food eat all the bugs
 
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
you want it just has to be labeled that
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
that's what you're eating and so just
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
honesty and integrity and labeling and
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
that's all I have I'll take your
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
saitis good morning and thank you um for
 
00:14:43.959 --> 00:14:45.069 align:start position:0%
saitis good morning and thank you um for
your

00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
testimony how prevalent is this is this
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
new technology is it in New Hampshire
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
now this is relatively new uh
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
breakthrough technology if you want to
 
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
call it breakthrough It's relatively new
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
but uh the US government has um invested
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers dollars in the research of
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
mRNA vaccine vaccines excuse me mRNA
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
technology to produce foods that
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinate that's that's been done for
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
years now so that is not new in fact the
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
first article I found was back in the
 
00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959 align:start position:0%
year 2000 and I know there's things
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
before that um but
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh so for at least maybe 20 close to 25
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
years we've been looking at turning food
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
into into a means of vaccinating people
 
00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
lab grown meat is a relatively new uh uh
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
process um but it has been around a few
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
years and it's being introduced
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
restaurants there are restaurants uh in
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
some of the more Chic locations of the
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
country like a a downtown San Francisco
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
has one restaurant the New York City has
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
one restaurant where they are
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
introducing lab grown meat on their
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
menus uh as well as insects as well uh
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
and so it is while it is relatively new
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's in New Hampshire uh
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's okay that if it comes into New
 
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's not the problem it just
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be labeled
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
properly representative Bixby yeah so um
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of the MRNA vacines and uh and
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
meat so you uh if uh there is for
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
instance an mRNA ma vaccine that would
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
protect poultry against Aven flu and
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's meant to Pro protect the animals
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
bill the purpose of the
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinations is designed to get you and
 
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.670 align:start position:0%
vaccinations is designed to get you and
me

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
vaccinated if the MRNA if they can
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that mRNA a does not go from
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if the the poultry is
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
immunized against Aven flu that it
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
cannot transfer from the chicken to me
 
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:12.039 align:start position:0%
then I guess that wouldn't be a problem
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
but if they can't prove that then it
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem because the aim is to
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
vaccinate you and me thank you
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
representative I have a question sure
 
00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.270 align:start position:0%
representative I have a question sure
about

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
um so you have in two sections of this
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill where
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
You're simply labeling um the item and
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
that to me is very reasonable why would
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
you not then just simply have a label
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
put on an item that uh has the MRNA te
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
technology or vaccination as opposed to
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
Banning the the product Al together I
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
mean we see in the grocery store uh you
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
know when we buy milk not does not
 
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.789 align:start position:0%
know when we buy milk not does not
contain

00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
contain
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
U product from an animal that was
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with BST or whatever so um
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
different because of the safety involved
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
with or the questions that still arise
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
of mRNA technology the links
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
to um the known links between mRNA
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
injections and blood CL
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
myocarditis the
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
perpetu perpetuation of illness whatever
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
and it begs the question that come to my
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
mind how do we know what it is that
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
we're being vaccinated against because
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
there could be some disease out there
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't know about how are we
 
00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
going to get vaccinated against that we
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
can only have a vaccine against things
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
know our body has to produce prod that
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
antibody so how is it going to know what
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
antibody to produce and so which animals
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
are or which plants are we going to
 
00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.470 align:start position:0%
are or which plants are we going to
introduce

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
which Technologies into and so because
 
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
there are so many questions about the
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
safety and perhaps even the efficacy of
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
mRNA I don't think it's a good idea to
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
put it in our food
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
supply we already regulate it we're
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
already regulating it with with respect
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
to Medicine you put it in the food
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
supply and you lose all regulation after
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you um I'm not
 
00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure I
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
understand my my question
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
was why wouldn't we simply label the
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
package to to show the consumer that it
 
00:19:50.149 --> 00:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
the animal or product contains uh
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
ingredients that came from something
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
that was vaccinated with
 
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.430 align:start position:0%
that was vaccinated with
mRNA

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
mRNA
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
technology if if you want wanted make an
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill it's in your hands
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
now I just personally don't like the
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
idea of somebody injecting something
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
into me against my wishes because
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
eventually the food supply is going to
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
get limited as to what is going to be
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
available to me than you uh everything
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be injected in or it's not
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
going to be labeled somehow or another I
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
we have just to give you an example the
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the dairy the milk producers are
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
trying to introduce milk products that
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
they can add ingredients to milk and
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
still call it milk and they're trying to
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
do this without having to label it as
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
containing some other ingredient besides
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
milk and I don't mean just adding
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
vitamin A and vitamin D that get
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
stripped out during the homogeneization
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
and pasteurization process so they're
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
already attempts to to conceal what's
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
actually ingredients in our
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
food so you know in an ideal world you
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
could just slap a label on it this
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
contains mRNA technology and then one
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
person buy buys one one person buys the
 
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
other but unfortunately what ends up
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
happening is you be find a shrinking
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
availability of that which is not going
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
to have the technology invest injected
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
into it thank you uh representative
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
Howard you had your hand up
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
before thank you madam chair um I
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually have two questions the first is
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
um is the Mr mRNA in food intended only
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of vaccination or does
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
it have other other uses that somehow
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
like preserve the food or something like
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
that no it's it is designed as a
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
vaccination a vehicle for vaccination
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yeah follow up is is the
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
evidence of harm such as long covid
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
caused by mRNA as you claim it to be
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
coincidental or is it proven causal no
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
the the studies are be coming out now
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
that are linking the two people who who
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
have uh experienced this long covid and
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
the common denominator is being the
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination thank you representative
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
bman thank you madam chair I want to
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
just follow up on that and then I have a
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
second question if that's okay the first
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
one was um you said that they're linked
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
um but there's a very uh different um it
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
means something different if the
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
causation versus correlation do you know
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
if it's causation or
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
correlation has causation been proven I
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
should say causation has been linked to
 
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
blood clots
 
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.750 align:start position:0%
blood clots
um

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
myocarditis and then the the studies
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
that are coming out are showing
 
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
direct linkage as a causal causal
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
causational link to the long Co itself
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
that's the the newest things that are
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
coming out uh from all these studies
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and follow up sure go ahead
 
00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you this is a different question
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
but and forgive my naive on this um I
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
know right now it's pretty popular for
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
that like impossible meat and the
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know there's two different
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
ones um uh which are known to be lab
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
grown meat Alternatives do you know if
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
this falls into that category in any way
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
and or does the bill address it in any
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
way my understanding of impossible meat
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
is it is a
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
plantbased meat protein source so it is
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
not lab grown
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
meat unless unless I'm unless I am
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
yeah they are actually lab grown one of
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
them I forget the other term there's one
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
that's impossible and then there's
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
another term that's similar and one of
 
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
them is actually lab grown so um I'm
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
just wondering if if that would be
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
addressed in here maybe something to
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
follow up on I guess so so lab grown
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
meat is is developed from actual animal
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
cells it's placed in what's called a a
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
bioreactor there are other amino acids
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and other things that that combine
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
comine and grow the cells to produce
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
this meat product impossible meat my
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of what that with that is
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
is actually a plant-based whether it's
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
be soybean or uh uh peas chickpeas or
 
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
something whatever whatever whatever
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
other source it may be because there are
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
people who want to have uh plant-based
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
protein sources and not meat-based
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're vegan or vegetarian or
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
such and so if it actually contains
 
00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:30.430 align:start position:0%
such and so if it actually contains
animal

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
animal
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
cells and grown then it this then then
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
yes this would cover that the the it
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
would be have to be labeled as lab grown
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
and the lab would have to be the the the
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
contact information for the lab would
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
have to be on the label itself um if
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
it's just a plant-based product then
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
this would not be covered it would not
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
be required to be covered under this
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
because it's not actually meat thank
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Murray thank you
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair um to follow up on
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative bchan's question I guess
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I I I think she may
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
have been alluding to and if I'm wrong
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
please correct me representative but is
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
around sort of um the the there are
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
fungal based things that are also grown
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
as a meat substitute or alternative so I
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe that was more to the point like
 
00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
those are those are not lab grown Meats
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's a completely different process a
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
completely different
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
product these they are not developed
 
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
using animal
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
cells and so that is the key to I'm
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
assuming what you're getting at and what
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
what you are getting at those are actual
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
plant-based products and not uh animal
 
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:49.510 align:start position:0%
plant-based products and not uh animal
cell-based

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
products uh represent smart after my
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
question okay um so I noticed if I if I
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
read on um the bill line 17
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
Page I guess it's the just a page of the
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill um line 17 says no food sold in the
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire shall have M RNA
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
technology added to it would you be
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
amable to a change to this to say no
 
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
food sold in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
shall have mRNA technology added to it
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
for thep purpose of vaccinating the
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
public because I'm looking at this and
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
first of
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
all as I understand no mRNA animal
 
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines are currently available for
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
Farmers uh and other animal owners in
 
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.549 align:start position:0%
Farmers uh and other animal owners in
our

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
state and to representative bixby's
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
point I mean there may be um mRNA
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
technology Gene therapies whatever um
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
coming to to um the agricultural
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
Community which would help animals and
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
prevent them from um having certain
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
diseases we certainly want to use
 
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
whatever tools that are available to um
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
combat these
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
diseases so I'm wondering if we should
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
if we could limit this um and going back
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
to the the phrase just for the purpose
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
of vaccinating the
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.510 align:start position:0%
of vaccinating the
public

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
the only question that comes to my mind
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
in that otherwise I I would have no
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
problem with it is how do we split that
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
hair because how do we know that by
 
00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:40.519 align:start position:0%
injecting something into an animal it or
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
or the manipulation of a plant seed
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
because there's also mRNA technology in
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
Plants as well how do we know that that
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
that does not then transfer itself into
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
our body so as a byproduct even that it
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
is vaccinating us against something um
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
contamination or however whatever it
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
would be so somebody could say well
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
we're not purposely trying to vaccinate
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
anybody by doing this oops it happened
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm not I otherwise I agree that I
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem with just in it
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
in itself I just don't know how to split
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
the hair thank you representative
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
smart thank you madam chair to be
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
nice um I have a question my question is
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
um we we label Foods they they put
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
everything in labels um are supposed to
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
be there why is mRNA technology why
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
would that be different or bugs or fake
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
meat be different in the labeling that
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
we would have to specify this I mean you
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
can't even have hormones or you know
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
antibiotics in our milk they dump it on
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
the on the milk room floor um before
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
they take it so I don't understand why
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
different do you want to know where your
 
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
food comes from oh I do and that's what
 
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
I thought the purpose of labeling was so
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
but my question is why would this these
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
three items not fall under the
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
regular they're not that's just the
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
whole point they're they're not covered
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
by any labeling requirements now okay
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
you you cannot go into a grocery store
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
and find this this
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
food product contains mRNA this food
 
00:29:33.549 --> 00:29:33.559 align:start position:0%
product is lab grown meat maybe
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
eventually it will uh they maybe they
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll they'll market it that way
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
um but as it is right now you have no
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
idea they there's a lot of deception in
 
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
labeling too um so when things are
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
labeled whole grain what does that mean
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
um non- GMO we we we look for for labels
 
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:55.880 align:start position:0%
to say non-GMO well the epitome of GMO
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
is lab grown meat and mrm a it's
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
straight up
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
GMO and and so
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
um they're they're not being labeled now
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't see where they would this
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
would just require them to be labeled
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
okay so that way we know where our food
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
is coming
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
from okay representative NAB thank you
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I would just ask I'm not
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
a physician I don't know that anyone in
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
this room is or an immunologist or a
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
biochemist this feels like a subject
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
where we need a little bit of expertise
 
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the Department of
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
Agriculture is going to be able to
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
provide it but this concept of the
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
vaccine transferring from an animal to a
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
human by consuming the animal is not I
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
feel like we need a little more
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
information on it um we certainly don't
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
want to compromise food safety animal
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
safety bring diseases into the state um
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
so I just would ask if we don't get that
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
information from the Department of
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
Agriculture or someone else in this room
 
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
that we are provided it in another
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
fashion we would have a work session on
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
those thank y representative Bixby yeah
 
00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
so I was wondering um whether there are
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
current uh labeling requirements in
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
terms of ingredients that are already
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
present in FDA uh rules and and laws
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
that would uh require the labeling of
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
lab grown meat as such and require the
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh and the use of insects as ingredient
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
as such and if those already exist would
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
this bill conflict with those this bill
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
would that I have been able to find
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
nothing that would conflict with current
 
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.909 align:start position:0%
nothing that would conflict with current
labeling

00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
labeling
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
rules um the
 
00:31:39.629 --> 00:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
FDA has a what's called a smart label
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
that that they're introducing how long
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's been around I don't remember um but
 
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.070 align:start position:0%
it's been around I don't remember um but
it

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
is basically you you could go up to your
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
food and it won't really have anything
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
written on it but it maybe a QR code and
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
you could scan that QR code and up Pops
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
the ingredient label it sounds really
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
simple and great so you can have smaller
 
00:32:06.909 --> 00:32:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
but the idea is to make it very
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
clear what it is you are actually
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing there is a difference between
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
lab grown meat and The Butcher Shop
 
00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:22.430 align:start position:0%
lab grown meat and The Butcher Shop
cut

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
cut
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
cow and so because there is a difference
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
one is just cut the other is
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
processed there needs to be a
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
distinction between the two made and
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
somebody may not have the time or the
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
ability uh and it just
 
00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:45.799 align:start position:0%
looks to have to take the time to scan
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
that QR code hopefully you have Wi-Fi
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
connection hopefully it comes through
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
and you can see there's nothing to
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
interrupt your ability to see what is
 
00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
actually on that label if it's just
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
clearly labeled this is lab grown meat
 
00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
and to go back to the question that the
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned about we don't
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
know about the transfer of vaccines into
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
It's a Wonderful point and I mentioned
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
it earlier as well and but you bring up
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
a great point there but we do know that
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have restrictions on hormones that
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
are given to cat that was brought up
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
over here as well if milk contains
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
because it has to be tested if milk
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
contains the hormones the milk has to
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
get dumped right there on the floor that
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
we because we know it transfers those
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
hormones transfer from the cow to to the
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
consumer through the milk and so because
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
there is that risk we know it can happen
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
there is the risk that it would happen
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh but just uh that's one of the dangers
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
that must be be fared out before we
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
allow it to be in put into our
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
food representative Howard um do we is
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
there food on the market currently that
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
contains mRNA technology and and if so
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
against well that's the
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
mystery uh unfortunately there's not a
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
whole lot of forthcoming on whether or
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
not it's being
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
used uh there's a lot of
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
that there are attempts to do it there's
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
a desire to do it uh whether or how pre
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
prevalent I'm sure it's been been tested
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's the how we do things we're
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to test them uh how widespread
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
that is I don't know but I have read
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
articles where herds have been but what
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
they are being injected I have that I
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
don't know that's not very clear in the
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
articles that I've been able to read so
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the answer is yes probably
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
how far I don't know and what for I
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't know either because it's just not
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
the information is just not open
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
so are you fam is the reason why you put
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
this bill forward because there's been
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh there has been a lot of conjecture
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's out there um new sources I have
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
several that I just pulled up um that
 
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
they are experimenting with this
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
technology in animals oh I know they're
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
experimenting with it it's whether or
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
not it's being
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
released out into cons to the for the
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
consumer to to have
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
testing testing animals in a laboratory
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
Farm is one thing that I know they're
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
doing whether or not they're allowing
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
that those those cattle or or pigs to be
 
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they're doing chickens
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
yet or not but cattle and pigs uh if
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
they're being released to the market
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I don't know and just
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
exactly what they are injecting them
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
what what is the virus they're tried to
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
prevent is what I don't it's not clear
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
in any of the Articles I've been able to
 
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.790 align:start position:0%
in any of the Articles I've been able to
find

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
followup so I have an article here here
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
that says uh that's talking about it
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
being tested in pigs and I um myself and
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
a and a group of other um folks have
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
reached out to several different
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
distributors from Trader Joe's to Whole
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
Foods as well concerning this as well as
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
concerning um the bugs um we do know for
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
a fact that the bugs are named
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
underneath uh certain
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
um like a you know call it like a an
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
acronym you know what I mean so we know
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
that so they're hiding it under that
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
correct you know whatever those acronyms
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
are so you have to be careful but uh we
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
got some really great feedback from some
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
of the local um that they're keeping an
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
eye on this of course especially you
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
know if you're purchasing um
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative Penza do you have a
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
question so are you familiar with uh any
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the local groceries or whatever that
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
have had feedback in regards with us
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
saying that they I have not contacted
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
any local Grocers okay okay uh to to
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
find out what they plan on doing or what
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
products may be available but you are
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
correct about insects you will not find
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
on the label uh ingredient number one
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
crickets unless you're buying a lollipop
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
it's called a cricet and then it has a
 
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
cricket well sugar sucrose artificial
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
coloring Cricket you can also get
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
grasshoppers representative
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
grasshoppers representative
ktoa

00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
ktoa
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
um knowing what the labeling laws are
 
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.550 align:start position:0%
um knowing what the labeling laws are
now

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
and when we see the hormone labels and
 
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
the antibiotic labels some of them state
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
that no hormones are
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
added and to me that says they're not
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
adding hormones but they could be in the
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
feed or in another source so truth and
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
labeling I think is extremely important
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
how would you distinguish if we wanted
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
to amend this um that you know there
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
could be mRNA in the food source or
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
whatever but they're not adding it or
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
injecting it into the animal how would
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
you distinguish that and how would we
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
label for that
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
information that's a
 
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.309 align:start position:0%
information that's a
toughy

00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
toughy
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh the cow may not be injected
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
is that I don't know because you start
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
peeling back the onion and it goes all
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
so that one I'm not sure how to handle
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
but I as far as like for the purpose of
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinating the public is a great place
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
to start inserting that
 
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
to start inserting that
Clause

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I don't even know where
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
the process begins end again we don't
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
know whether it
 
00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
transfers we don't know if it transfers
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
from the from the animal to the person
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
but we do know that they're trying to
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
make it so that if you eat that salad
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
you're vaccinated if you eat that cow
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
you would be vaccinated and so we know
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
purpose so does the process begin with
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
the cow eating the grass than the then
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
we eat the cow that I don't
 
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.109 --> 00:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
Bosman thank you madam chair um kind of
 
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
Switching gears here looking at the cost
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
projected uh for a compliance officer um
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
could you just looking at it I'm looking
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
at the salary it looks I'm wondering
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
where you got those estimates or the
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
salary pres bman that was put in by um
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
by the um uh the uh the people who do
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
the fiscal notes oh I'm sorry so that's
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
not anything that's put together by the
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh the author of the bill okay and so he
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
would not know that information I'm sure
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
that when we have uh folks from
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
different agencies come in we have
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
testimony coming you can ask that
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Penza you had a
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
question are you familiar with um
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
Missouri House Bill
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
1169 I am okay I so I haven't read the
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
whole thing forgive me but I am familiar
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
with its intention okay so it's a
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
fantastic Bill are you trying to model
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
that bill to here I actually wrote this
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
before I read that so I I to say that I
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
modeled it after that
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
no followup one followup yeah would you
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
consider having um this pretty much say
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
that it is um labeling meat or anything
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
for potential gen therapy product like
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
we do similar with
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
hormones so that's what I'm saying like
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's that's what it gets labeled as a
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
gene therapy product that was in that
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
was in the meat that was injected into
 
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.470 align:start position:0%
was in the meat that was injected into
it

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
correct my objective is to just prohibit
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
the use of mRNA the the purposeful
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
injection of mRNA into the food
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
supply so it's it's not just a labeling
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
and then it's okay it's a you're not
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
going to do it because it is not
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
demonstrate itself to be safe to use
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
there are too many unintended
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
consequences um not having scrutinized
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
the Missouri Bill enough I don't know
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
what they are actually trying to achieve
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
although I i' I've scanned it I know
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
that it's there there are other states
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
that are attempting to do the same kind
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
of thing um it's progress I have no idea
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh each one and hard to follow sometimes
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
but the objective here is to at this
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
time say you cannot
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
inject or use
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
mRNA in our food supply the intended
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
purpose being to vaccinate people
 
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.670 align:start position:0%
purpose being to vaccinate people
against

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
whatever because we just don't
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
have a proven track record of it being
 
00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
safe or
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
effective okay thank you um and I think
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
we're done with our questions from the
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee so appreciate you introducing
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
the bill and answering so many questions
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
I am I I've got to get back to an
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
executive session so me ducking out is
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
not to uh okay tell you guys to pound
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
sand or anything like that but I am
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
actually in a in an executive SE
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
downstairs thank you very much sure have
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
a good rest of the day and I'd like to
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
call Colleen Smith from DHHS to come
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
testimony good morning good morning
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and members of the committee
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to provide
 
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
information on House Bill
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
1572 the department is not taking a
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but we did want to
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
provide some information around the
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was alluded to earlier
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
um this is very new technology all um
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
components of this bill the cell culture
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
cultivated meat is regulated currently
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
by USDA and FDA there are two companies
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
in the country that are allowed to make
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
product and right now we believe it's
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
very limited in distribution to um
 
00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:36.440 align:start position:0%
restaurants and specific in larger
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
cities but it's not it's very um Limited
 
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.390 align:start position:0%
cities but it's not it's very um Limited
in

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
distribution um it is uh as was alluded
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
to in previous testimony new technology
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
so we don't know how what the
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated um anticipated track this
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
will take will it be in grocery stores
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
one day um I understand it it's very
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
expensive to make this product so it it
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
might be just in a niche market for
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
quite some time so we have a lot of
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about what this would mean
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
for the Department as far as
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in regulating this um
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently the two products are chicken
 
00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
products that are allowed to be made by
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
these two companies that have been
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
approved federally to make them and the
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
labeling is self cultivated chicken that
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
it needs to be labeled on that product
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
so that would conflict with um the
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
language and the statute as directed to
 
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
label it as lab grown meat um the also
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
the second part of this bill that speaks
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
to mRNA technology we understand that no
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
mRNA technology is currently approved
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
for any cattle vaccine and the given the
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
how a how how this is digested in animal
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
tissues it would be very difficult for
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
the Department to know if this
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
technology was used in producing food so
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
we have some some concerns what it mean
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
um like a traceback with individual
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
Growers to make sure that their animals
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
that they were using for food um didn't
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
use this
 
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
technology and then the final component
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
is the allowance of insects So currently
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of any producers in New
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire offering insects but it is um
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
available in other parts of the country
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
or world but they would ALS so have to
 
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
be from an approved source and would be
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
required to be labeled on a product um
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
if they were to be used as an ingredient
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
they'd have to be demonstrated that they
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
were inspected there was no food safety
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
issues with using that component if they
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
were able to be used in food um so we
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
did put in a because the department
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
would be charged with enforcement of
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
these three components we did put forth
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note to include an inspector
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
who would be charged with um enforcing
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
these three these three areas and again
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
just want to stress that they're very
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
novel so we're very we're uncertain as
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
to um what this would entail for us not
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
only now but you know years to
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
come and happy to take any questions the
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
committee has representative
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
brard thank you madam chair uh now you
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
said the uh in a couple of largest
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
cities um they are currently serving lab
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
grown meat uh is the consumer
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
aware so so what we know is that it's a
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
it's in restaurants and again I believe
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's just n Niche and I would I I'm not
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with those two restaurants but
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
I would I would expect that probably it
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
is disclosed because that would be the
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
in people there are people that are
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
seeking out um cell cultured meat as a
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
alternative sorry in New Hampshire no no
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire so I'm only aware
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
of San Francisco in Washington DC as
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
having restaurants offering this product
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that it's distributed in
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
currently represent
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
piby so I'm wondering about um whether
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
mRNA uh in a particular form would
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
actually survive the process of being
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
consumed and because I my understanding
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
is that you know first you're dealing
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
with stomach acids and then there are
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
enzymes called mRNA Aces that are very
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
active at breaking down foreign mRNA so
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding I'm not an expert
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
in animal vaccines but in researching
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and contacting the USDA it's
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the vaccines don't
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
persist in animal tissues at all so that
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
even by cons they wouldn't be to in the
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
final product um so that's from our
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint it would make it a challenge
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
how how would we test for this or we'd
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
have to basically look at records of
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
producers to know if they had been
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated using an Mna technology if it
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
were to be approved in the future thank
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
you representative NAB thank you madam
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
um could you just clarify the insect
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
labeling you said they have to be
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
labeled is that as an insect product or
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
just they have to be labeled as any
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
other food prodct be just as any other
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
food ingredient it would have to be
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
labeled as a component of the food okay
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and um so Miss Smith when they
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
label this
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
component would they is is there a
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to actually say
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
something like crickets or do they give
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
their scientific name for crickets or
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it would be the common
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
name the common name of the they would
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
have to use the common name yeah okay
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for Miss
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
Smith senan thank you for your testimony
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
today and I'd now like to call um
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner Sean Jasper from Department
 
00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:03.549 align:start position:0%
commissioner Sean Jasper from Department
of

00:49:03.549 --> 00:49:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Madam chairman
 
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I am Sean
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
Jasper commissioner of the Department of
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food I am taking
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
a position on on this bill uh primarily
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that if you were to pass
 
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
it it would severely limit the food
 
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
options for people in the state of of
 
00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.069 align:start position:0%
options for people in the state of of
New

00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um which feeding people is
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
very important to me and I and I say
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
that because we have to recognize that
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're country of what 330 million people
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
we're a state of 1.4
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
million so if we just think about that
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
and you put something like this on a
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
requirement many companies would will
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
simply not come to New Hampshire anymore
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
they will not send their product into
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we've had this
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
discussion for many years over certain
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements within the New
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature and that really
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
always comes back to that New Hampshire
 
00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
is not California people are not going
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
to do things simply because New
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire says it I I've unfortunately
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
sent a link to you or an email to you
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
later I had sent to the chairman because
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
I couldn't find a link for the whole
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
committee and it was pretty uh timec
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
consuming to try to paste all of your
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
emails in so I sent it this morning I'm
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
not sure if the if you can just CL click
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
on the links or not you might have to
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
copy and paste but there are some here
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
and one is called the MRNA conspiracy
 
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
theories and I I'm going to go right
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
back to to the beginning here and I'm
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to be longer than I thought
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
thought after hearing the testimony of
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor anything that you put into
 
00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
animal feed comes with a
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
cost Farmers just don't go out and buy
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
things gee it sounds great there is a
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
reason and so for anyone to believe that
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
someone or the government was going to
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
try to use this technology to vaccinate
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
all of us would come at a cost somebody
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be getting paid there need to be a
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
budget line and I would suggest to you
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
that this would be the most ineffective
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
way to vaccinate the population because
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
you'd have to know that everybody was
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
going to be eating a certain product or
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
certain products to get there and it
 
00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
would still be very costly and in
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
inefficient and obviously every time you
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
ate the same product you're getting
 
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinated again and in an extreme cost
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that there is no idea
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
out there currently that we would would
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
be vaccinating people against against
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
their their will through this method
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
we've also heard from uh HHS that it's
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
not something that's currently available
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
um it's being being talked about and I
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
know that um there is there are
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
discussions going on with within the uh
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
National Association the state's
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
Departments of Agriculture there was a
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
meeting hosted which in included Merc
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
which I would assume would be one of the
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
primary companies who would be
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
interested in this Tex is is looking at
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
it but we can't
 
00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
be out there doing these
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
things and expecting to have a positive
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
res result for the consumers of New
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would suggest that um if
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about these things
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
and there was a market for it then the
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
opposite would be true is people would
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
be um labeling their products saying you
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
know that not containing m&amp;as or
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
anything else I mean we we cannot expect
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
to go in this direction but I also would
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
um would point out as I think the
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative from HHS did there's not
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
going to be any way to know if this is
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
this is true and maybe everybody just
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
stopped sending anything into New
 
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um fine or requiring labeling
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
because how is the meat process are
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
going to know what that animal was fed
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
there's no current requirements to say
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
well what was the
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
ingredients you know there are certain
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
things that the government requires but
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's at the federal level if this is
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
federal um requirement then nobody is
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to know go to lame and gos town
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
are they going to know what those cows
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
were fed or those pigs or they're not
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
and there's no requirement to do that so
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
we could be disrupting our food chain
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
significantly with anything like this
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
even when it comes to labeling because
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
people aren't going to know and if you
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
require them to do something that they
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
cannot reasonably know then they're
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
simply going to withdraw from the market
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions
 
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.670 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions
representative

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you uh for your testimony
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
as always it's enlightening the
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so the so disruption of the food
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
chain not good um but for these two
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
labels insects and manufactured meat
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
those seem like
 
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.510 align:start position:0%
those seem like
very

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
small I mean the manufactured meat
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
served in two places in the United
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
States one of which is not New Hampshire
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
insects are not served in New Hampshire
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
as far as testimony says so how big a
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
deal is that is that like a sky is
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
falling or is that a smaller deal yeah I
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not as concerned about the insect
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
labeling and again I I think you heard
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
that that would be required coming into
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now so I don't I don't
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
think we want to reinvent the wh and you
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
need to certainly look at that um
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
certainly you know that's something that
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as disruptive because I
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to ever see that
 
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
become a mainstream staple of the diet
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire sure thank
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
brard thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner would you believe that it
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
was important enough for us Congressman
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
Thomas Massie to file an amendment to
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
the uh house agriculture Appropriations
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
Bill amendment number 86 that states
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
none of the funds made available by this
 
00:55:54.029 --> 00:55:54.039 align:start position:0%
act may be used to fund Any Grant
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
related to any transgenic edible
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine oh I I would certainly believe
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
that and I believe that there are
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of amendments um offered all
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
the time and if Congress passed that
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
then then great but I also believe that
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
this is Congress is the only place you
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
know the federal government is the only
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
place where something like this can be
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
effective the state of New Hampshire can
 
00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559 align:start position:0%
cannot be effective in doing this we can
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
only harm our our food food chain and
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
that starts
 
00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
potentially right here with our own
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
local slaughter
 
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
houses represent na thank you madam
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a fiscal note
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill but I wonder if
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
you could speak at all to what it costs
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
producers to have to label products or
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
test products what the impact on them
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
financially is I don't have any
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
expertise in in that area you know I was
 
00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
a little puzzled by the um by the fiscal
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
note because it would seem although we
 
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
just heard there's probably no way to
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
test test it so I'm not sure what the
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
inspector would doing that is doing
 
00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.240 align:start position:0%
because that would be literally if there
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
was the technology to enforce this bill
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
every single piece of of meat coming
 
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
into the state or even being produced in
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
the state would need to be tested to be
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
in full compliance um and I would think
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be significantly higher
 
00:57:19.029 --> 00:57:19.039 align:start position:0%
than just the cost of an
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
employee follow up that's a cost that's
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
born by the producer right the testing
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
well I don't think so because I I don't
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
with without the
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
authorization you know perhaps perhaps
 
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
you could look at it that way and say
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
everybody would be required to do that
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
right now this bill my reading of it
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
just says you can't bring it in so it
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that every producer shall
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
test their product to ensure so I I
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
think it would be on the state if we
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
were going to
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh require
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
this any other questions for the
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner represent
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
Penza so in regards with the comments I
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
think from DHHS and then that you
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
reiterated in regards with like the bugs
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't say on ingredients
 
00:58:18.309 --> 00:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
crickets it doesn't say grasshoppers so
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
it literally is a it's like a code like
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
let's say if it said MEC or whatever so
 
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.390 align:start position:0%
let's say if it said MEC or whatever so
um

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
I think transparency and labeling is
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
important so do you have a problem with
 
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
that well I you're gonna have to tell
 
00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
people what it is well you know again I
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
think for anything coming into New
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're going to limit limit
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
the market if you do something different
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
than the other you know 47 States at
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
least um on the Continental un us um
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
Hawaii and Alaska may be a little bit
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
different but uh
 
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
um right now if you look it it most of
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
the ingredients you know they
 
00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:07.039 align:start position:0%
use not the common names on most
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
ingredients on any package usually gives
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
you something that's you know most of us
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
have no idea what that is so to
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
use um a common name because I think
 
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
there's probably not one type of cricket
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
and so you couldn't just say cricket
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
you'd have to go back to to you know the
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
genus and the species I suppose and
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
we're not going to understand that so
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
again I just I don't think that New
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can can be an island of
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
labeling any other questions for the
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner representative com
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
tool thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question um
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
my question uh regarding all of the
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements is my concern over
 
00:59:52.349 --> 00:59:52.359 align:start position:0%
the smart labeling that's coming out
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
with the QR codes where where the
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
ingredients will no longer be listed on
 
00:59:57.839 --> 00:59:58.750 align:start position:0%
ingredients will no longer be listed on
the

00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
product but you would have to scan a QR
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
code while
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
shopping how would we how would that
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
because that would be rapidly done by QR
 
01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
code ingredients coming into different
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
states could be changed immediately
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
because they're on a QR code um so
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
what's the positives and the and the
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
negatives please well I certainly would
 
01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:25.069 align:start position:0%
negatives please well I certainly would
hope

01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
hope
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
that as that
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
technology progresses the federal
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
government would um look at that and
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that if there were changes to
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
what was approved by the uh FDA there
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
would be severe fines if those QR codes
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
were changed we're not going to be able
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
to stop technology I don't particularly
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
like that idea that I wouldn't be able
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
to just look at something but if that is
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
what is allowed by the federal
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
government then that's what we're going
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
to have to live with and hopefully
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
um if they do that they put those
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
necessary fines in place I mean I
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
without fines without consequences yeah
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
you're probably right people can can
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
change things you don't know to what to
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
what end but um that's a technology that
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
is probably going to uh be with
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
us just quick
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
you commissioner um I agree with you I
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
like to see the labels
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
listed but Mike what I have heard and I
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've heard the same is
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
that part of the reason for the QR code
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
on different products is so that if
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
they're making one batch with one
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
specific set of products and another
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
batch with another they've changed the
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
ingredients out they can then put a
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
different QR code on that
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
so you could be buying the same product
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
but have two two separate ingredients
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
because the QR codes are different and

being here today by name is Matthew

kulan I represent Grafton 5 and uh the
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of HB 1565 which is also
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
known as the right to Homestead Act and
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
I'll start by reading my testimony here
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
um current New Hampshire law allows a
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
person to bake and sell a loaf of bread
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
but prohibits them from making and
 
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
selling a delicious sandwich I'd like to
 
01:04:39.670 --> 01:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
change that HB uh
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
1565 aka the right to Homestead Act
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
affirms an individual's right to buy and
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
sell homemade foods in a variety of
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
Market settings it adopts a permissive
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
approach instead of our current Pro
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
prohibitive one which heavily favors
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
large scale Agriculture and conventional
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
Grocers New Hampshire's Homestead food
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
statutes are dated and difficult for
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
Farmers Market managers and retail store
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
owners to understand leading to
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
incorrect interpretation of statutes
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
which hurts our local food producers it
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
makes their delicious products difficult
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
to Market additionally our current
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
statues um and incentivized producing
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
sugary and unhealthy Foods over
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
nutritious home-cooked or plant-based
 
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
meals the right to Homestead Act
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
corrects this by repealing the homestead
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
license hereby Shifting the state's

Focus to enforcing transparent labeling
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
requirements it is estimated by the USDA
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire produces between four
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
and 6% of its own food this amount is
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
far too low and poses a serious threat
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
to to our state's food security allowing
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
the sale of potentially hazardous foods
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh AKA refrigerated Foods creates an
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial Gateway for granite
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
Staters of all walks of life it has the
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
real potential to introduce people to
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
new and exciting Cuisines while giving

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has about 4,000 Farms most of
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
which are small operations making less
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
than $10,000 a year the right to
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
Homestead Act can help transform our
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
existing small farm infrastructure into
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
a vital and resilient network of local
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
food vendors and Artisans it may also
 
01:06:45.789 --> 01:06:45.799 align:start position:0%
make it easier for Grassroots
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
organizations to provide meals and
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
mutual Aid to neighbors and communities
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
in need similar policies have been
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
enacted in many States including Montana
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
California Maine and others which have
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
resulted in higher cases of people
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
feeding one another with no rise in
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
foodborn illness it's in the interest of
 
01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
growing the amount of food produced in
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh in which I present HP
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
1565 and ask the members of this
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
committee to consider supporting the
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire's right to
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
Homestead and with that I will open it
 
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
up to any
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
bman thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative and again I'm this is my
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
third committee day so trying to learn
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
all the rules all good yeah um can you
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
tell me um it's uh how do you what are
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
you thinking in terms of how we make
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
sure that the food is safe if we're if
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're bringing if we're decreasing this
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
regulation the bill actually
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
outlines uh like pages of guidelines for
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
how uh products ought to be labeled so
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
we're moving towards strengthening
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
labeling uh requirements and I think
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
that we can actually um satisfy all the
 
01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
needs of a license by strong labeling uh
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
requirements so we can Define um these
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
requirements in statute uh with without
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh needing to have the license anymore
 
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.189 align:start position:0%
uh needing to have the license anymore
thank

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:08:39.199 --> 01:08:41.910 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
represent uh yes thank you oh can you
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
hear me sure yeah okay uh how does that
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
what you just said representative how
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
does that correspond with I believe it's
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's page one line 24 and 25 the
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
production and sale of Homestead food
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
products in accordance with this
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision are exempt from all
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
licensing permitting inspection
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
packaging and label laws in the
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
state uh how does that jive with what I
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
just said I mean yeah because I I
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
thought you said that there would be
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements but here this says
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's an exemption so I'm a little
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
confused um page two of the bill
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
outlines all of the uh requirements and
 
01:09:30.519 --> 01:09:30.529 align:start position:0%
exemptions and all the good stuff in
 
01:09:30.529 --> 01:09:32.950 align:start position:0%
exemptions and all the good stuff in
[Music]

01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
there representative Howard thank you
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
um I like this idea a lot I and I've
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
heard from my constituents that they um
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
that they supported as well a lot of a
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
lot of those kind of businesses in my
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
district um I work in a restaurant where
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the owners the lead people are
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
required to have a safe service
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
certificate could that something like
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
that that be included in this
 
01:09:58.990 --> 01:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
or um I would like it not to be included
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill but uh as it states in the
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill that uh nothing in this bill should
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
stop uh any collection of information or
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
of people's names and addresses and
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
things like that and also we have we do
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
have local control and uh self-
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
inspecting communities as well so there
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
is oversight so that bill will not
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
affect uh certifications like
 
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
nav oh did you have a followup no okay
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question could you
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
just speak to on the first page lines 30
 
01:10:45.149 --> 01:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
through 31
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
so does that allow for someone to have
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
up to a thousand chickens that they're
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
selling and it's that annual what is the
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
meaning of that
 
01:10:56.590 --> 01:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks for the question uh this
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
part uh part three actually outlines the
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
federal requirements so we're in
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
compliance with federal laws and
 
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines so that starts off with the
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
1,000 bird Rule and then there's two
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
other requirements are related to
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
poultry and poultry byproducts so by
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
outlining um these federal guidelines we
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
make it so uh we're in compliance with
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
the feds and also it's saying basically
 
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
that you know you can't shoot a deer and
 
01:11:33.149 --> 01:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
serve like wild game Chile you know as
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
good as that might sound it's not
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
covered underneath this bill because we
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.430 align:start position:0%
 
government

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
followup so you could have up to a
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
thousand chickens is that yeah that's
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
the current federal rule so someone can
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
process a thousand chickens that
 
01:11:58.990 --> 01:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
USDA law right now all right thank you
 
01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
chair so I just wanted to go back to
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
your question you just said something
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
about wild game Chile yeah um however
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
there are USDA inspection facilities for
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
Wild game so how are you parsing that
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
delineation out um I think it's I
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe it's covered in uh part A B and
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
C of part three where saying um it needs
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
to come from an inspected uh Source such
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
as a butcher shop grocery
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
situations okay okay represent
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes thank you um over the past
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions we've done a lot of
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
work in terms of making Homestead laws
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
more lenient okay and not sub subject to
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
licensing so I'm really confused about
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and can you kind of hone in on
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
why you see a need for it and why the
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
existing laws um prevent um you know
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
home uh homesteaders from increasing
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
their um you know profits and their
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
revenue uh well yeah we did actually do
 
01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
some good work um regarding Cottage
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
Foods last session and the cottage Foods
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
Community was really happy with all of
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
us on this committee actually so
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
congratulations everyone um but yeah I
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
mean farmers and local farmers have been
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
marginalized by industrialized food so
 
01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
if you can see that you know 94 to
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
96% of food in New Hampshire is not
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
local that's actually that's a food
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
security issue so the intent of the bill
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
is to provide a market-based solution to
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
production okay any other questions
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
represent Katon I just want to elevate
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
at the 30,000 ft to make sure my simple
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
mind understands essentially what you're
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
saying is if I want to sell food that I
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
make in my own kitchen that I'm good to
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
go as long as I meet those exceptions on
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
page two it's got to be labeled right
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and you know you've listed them all out
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
but as long as I do that I can open up
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
and sell on the sell that food out of my
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
kitchen yep okay in certain
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
situations gotcha okay thank
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby so one of the things that um we've
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
done in terms of uh making sure that uh
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
Homestead food
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh is uh and and and um uh is is safe
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
and or or if there is a problem that it
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
is the problem is very limited is by uh
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
restricting the circulation of the food
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
to direct Market situations such as
 
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
selling directly from the home selling
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
directly at a farmer's market um and you
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
have here that uh in um
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
section on page two uh section 4 a Roman
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
4 a that uh it could be sold on the
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
internet uh or by a third party vendor
 
01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
including a retail store or grocery
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
store and I'm wondering uh whether that
 
01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
maintains that connection with the
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
farmer or the the producer that we rely
 
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
on for safety yeah so it does
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
specifically state that um more
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
perishable foods that contain dairy and
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
meat uh need to be sold direct to
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
Consumer but that uh plant-based or like
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
baked goods things like that can be sold
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh retail so I do think there is a
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
protection in there for for that and um
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean myself I was a market
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
Gardener for 10 years that's my
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
experience and that's how I know about
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
this issue so it's always just you know
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
I could go to a farmers's market and
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
sell like lettuce and tomatoes and peas
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
or something separately and someone can
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
buy a thing of tomatoes and just stand
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
there and eat them but if I mixed those
 
01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
together and sold them as a salad I
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be like violating a law so uh know
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
just another another point
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
there yeah representative neb thank you
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair um it says in the fiscal
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
note that this removes the fee for
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
Homestead operators um which is a loss
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
of revenue for the state and I I feel
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
like this bill is making things more
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
permissive for Homestead
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
operators do you really think the $150
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
is a barrier to
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
entry and what was the thinking behind
 
01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
removing them having I just think that
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
if we can outline labeling requirements
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
that basically satisfy the license uh
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
the need of license sure then that's
 
01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
really not too big of a problem
 
01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.790 align:start position:0%
really not too big of a problem
[Music]

01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
here okay representative
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
dsy yes thank you uh on on uh page three
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
starting with line eight um you say uh
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
nothing in the subdivision shall be
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
conscrew to impede the Department of
 
01:17:49.870 --> 01:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services in any
 
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
investigation of food born illnesses but
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
then you say that the fine is
 
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
$75 for each so if I'm providing
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
Homestead food and it has an ill you
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
know foodborn illness in it I can only
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
be fined
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
$75 uh correct anyone that so you don't
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
need to have a license to have a
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
complaint filed against you anyone can
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
have a complaint filed against them uh
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
with food uh food protection uh Bureau
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
and um I also got some was able to get
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
some data on the homestead food
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
producers complaints from uh
 
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I found that uh from
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
2022 to um October of this year there
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
were 30 complaints so in a little over a
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
year there are 30 complaints 29 of those
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
complaints were people unclear on our
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
current statute so it's people
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
complaining about other people selling
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that they they're confused about
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of only one of those complaints was
 
01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
for a health concern so we're doing
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing pretty good so I think we
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
to open things up a little bit and grow

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.910 align:start position:0%
DHHS to speak on their opposition to
this

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Madam chair and
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
again my name is Colleen Smith I'm the
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
administrator for the food protection
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
section within the Department of Health
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and I'm joined today
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
by Katrina Hansen she's the chief of our
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
in infectious disease surveillance
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
section and she would be able to speak
 
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
to any questions that come up with
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
regard to foodborn illnesses so so the
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
department is opposed to 1565 as written
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
there are several concerns U first I'll
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
lay out exactly what is allowed
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
currently by Homestead food producers So
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
currently a homestead food operation is
 
01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to make foods which we call
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
non-p potentially hazardous or
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
considered shelf stable they don't
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
require refrigeration for safety their
 
01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
items think like things like baked goods
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
brownies cookies jams jellies candy that
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
a producer can make in their own home
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
without a license to sell at retail
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
stores to uh from their own home to
 
01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
farmers markets or from their own Farm
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
Stand if they want to sell to a
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant or via the Internet where
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
there's no direct cons consumer um Baker
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
or manufacturer relationship interaction
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
or it's like a a direct mailing they can
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
do that but they just need to have our
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
license and currently we have 145
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
licensed Homestead operations in in the
 
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
state's jurisdiction remember there are
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
15 cities and towns that have their own
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
authority around this and some of those
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
cities and towns don't allow Homestead
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
operations for um a variety of reasons
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
could be zoning could be they they just
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
have made that decision not to allow
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
home food
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
operations um the we have worked very um
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
hard with this committee over time to
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
allow small producers to have an easier
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
um easier Pathway to being able to offer
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
their food in Commerce uh a homestead
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
operation doesn't have to have a
 
01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen it can be their
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
regular residential kitchen their
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
regular refrigerator their regular um
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
sink um we allow them to have pets in
 
01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
the home they just have to secure them
 
01:22:43.950 --> 01:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
away in an area when they're making
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
their food and sanitized surfaces um
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
prior to their food production we are
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
very concerned about opening the avenue
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
to allow foods that require
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
refrigeration for safety or things like
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
acidified Foods um such as canned pesto
 
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
these things have a higher risk of if
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
done improperly to cause botulism which
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
it could lead to death of a consumer and
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
certainly we have at our heart is um
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
while these Foods could be sold if if
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass they could be
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
sold at restaurants they could be sold
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
at retail stores any any food born
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
illness outbreak is not only damaging to
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
those directly impacted but it's also
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
damaging to the reputation of New
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's food supply as a whole um we
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
we take um our responsibility very very
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
seriously and those that we license and
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
inspect and holding them to food safety
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
standards without a licensing and
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
inspection system for these Homestead
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
producers who could make sandwiches in
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
their home there's there's no guarantees
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
and really our enforcement it would be
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult we wouldn't it would
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
be really by complaints or if we had
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
food bone illness outbreaks that we
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
would know if someone was violating
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
these statutes because we have we have
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
no we would have no inventory we
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know how many are out there um
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we have concerns
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
about expanding the offerings that home
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
food producers can do there are several
 
01:24:14.189 --> 01:24:14.199 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchens in New Hampshire
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
that do allow to that are allowed uh
 
01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
they allow produ home um small producers
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
to rent space in a commercial setting to
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
offer Tok Marketplace um we license
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
those we have the opportunity to have
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
those dialogues to um have answer
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
questions food safety questions th this
 
01:24:33.910 --> 01:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
would take all of that off the table if
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
if folks could do that without having
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
our license and
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
inspection um I would be happy to answer
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee has
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so
 
01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:49.639 align:start position:0%
um if someone has a has one of the
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
homestead food licenses which is like
 
01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:53.390 align:start position:0%
homestead food licenses which is like
$150

01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
$150
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
are they allowed to um produce uh the
 
01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
the um potentially hazardous foods no
 
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
they're still limited to only making the
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
those that are shelf stable like jams
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
jellies cookies Etc thank
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
you representative NAB thank you madam
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
chair so when the figure on complaints
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
was cited earlier that would really just
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
have been complaints about those shelf
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
stable operations correct not
 
01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily so often we get complaints
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
from other uh it could be community
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
members could be other folks that are
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
making Homestead food operations about
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
other vendors selling products that
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
require refrigeration and so those are
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
those are the complaints that generally
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
we get concerning home food operations
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
that they're making that they're making
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
Foods um beyond what they're Allowed by
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
law to
 
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
make representative sofikitis
 
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair do we have
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
um a lot of um food born
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
illness so certainly and and I'll have
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
Katrina jump in if she if she would like
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
we since we don't allow any um foods
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
that are what we call potentially
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
hazardous or require refrigeration for
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
safety there's not a lot of data about
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
foodborn outbreaks we have had
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
historical foodborn outbreaks um we had
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
one uh many many years ago where someone
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
made pulled pork in their home and then
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
made Whole pork sandwiches was
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
improperly cooled again we only domestic
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
refrigeration's required they're not
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
they're not expect a home food is home
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
food operation doesn't have um a you
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
know Commercial Refrigeration to make
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
sure that things are are cooled properly
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes there might not be the food
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
safety knowledge there from that
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
producer it's a lot different than to
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
make food for your family versus to make
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
it for hundreds of of
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
people hi thank you uh Katrina Hansen
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
for the record I over see infectious
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
disease surveillance so we we do have we
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
have had few outbreaks associated with
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
homestead foods but I think that is also
 
01:27:02.950 --> 01:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
a success that we have really food that
 
01:27:04.590 --> 01:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
right now is available that is lower
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
risk but this bill allows food that
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
could be higher risk as Colleen
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
indicated um particularly meat and and
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
other products that are typically tied
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
to foodborn illness in regards to our
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
statistics uh bearing in mind that most
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
food born illnesses and also water born
 
01:27:20.669 --> 01:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
illnesses really kind of fall under this
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
anic pathogens several of them have to
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
be reported under our existing statute
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c so we do have data on these um
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
but many of these are typically under
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
reported and that is because of several
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
reasons which I can answer later if you
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
have further questions but typically we
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
see around 300 or so cases of campor on
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
a 10year average um shika toxin
 
01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
producing EOL or estc we've had seen 33
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
of those cases um salmonella 212 over
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
the past 10 years um the last case of
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
bachis was infant botulism in 2021 um
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
not associated with food products since
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's a separate type of illness um but
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
though we're seeing some reduction in
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
waterborne illness we have actually seen
 
01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
an increase of our anic pathogens
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
particularly salmonella encrypt and um
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
salmonella and C campor those have been
 
01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
increasing over the past 10
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
years thank
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
Penza would you um mind sending that
 
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
information to the committee of all
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
all of the confirmed cases because I
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
that my one of my questions was there is
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
you know when you can tell me the
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
confirmed case of botulism and I can't
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
find anything at all for food warant at
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
all in New Hampshire sure yeah I looked
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
back to 2001 and I did not see any cases
 
01:28:40.109 --> 01:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
of foodborn botulism in New Hampshire to
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
that point I am still looking into that
 
01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
I but we do also publish all of our
 
01:28:45.709 --> 01:28:45.719 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases as required under
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c and I'd be happy to share that
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
report to you it is published monthly
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
and it's over the last 5 years but if
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
you're if you're looking for more data
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to complete a data request
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
for you and provide you all that data
 
01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
and then I can also share what I
 
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.229 align:start position:0%
and then I can also share what I
presented

01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
here okay yeah quick followup yeah um so
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to be like where they took
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
place right I don't want to just see the
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
numbers I want to like so it would have
 
01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
like listed on here
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
2019 at the Puritan back room the neuro
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
virus death and the 19 so don't we see
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
that most of these things are happening
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
um in restaurants and we don't really
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
have this a homebased
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that's a
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very good question and
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
insightful so we we do do our best to
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
track location and where foodborn
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
illness may have been acquired from but
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
it's not always that easy it can be
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
really difficult particularly a lot of
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
these foodborn illnesses can take three
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
to five days sometimes a week before
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
someone experiences signs and symptoms
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
and by the time they usually typically
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
seek health care if they do which is
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
also rare I mean most people let
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
foodborn diarrheal illness run its
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
course um if they do seek Health
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
Healthcare may even be two weeks from
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
when they ate a particular food item and
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
at that point most people don't remember
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
what they ate I know for myself I may
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
struggle with what I ate yesterday so it
 
01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
can be very challenging to pinpoint the
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
many multitudes of products that can go
 
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
into eating one food item so one
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
sandwich may contain multiple food
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
products and that can be very difficult
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
but we also do our best with not not
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
only individual cases but outbreaks we
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
try to identify um the the ideology of
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
the of what is causing illness so we do
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
try to request human specimens
 
01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
particularly stool specimens and if we
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
can food items if there is a potential
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
outbreak or concern about an outbreak we
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
do have capability in our Public Health
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
lab to do typing and linking to see if
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
they're directly Associated but to even
 
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
acquire those um those clinical
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
specimens and then also acquire the food
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
specimens can be very challenging and
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
rarely do we really get both of them
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
often food items are often discarded by
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
the time an individual seeks care and we
 
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
have all of those specimens so we do our
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
best and we can try to pinpoint it but I
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
will say majority of our out out breaks
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
or even investigations we don't have a
 
01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
very clear sense exactly what is causing
 
01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.669 align:start position:0%
very clear sense exactly what is causing
that

01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
illness okay um I I have a quick
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
question to um for do are you aware of
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
any states that have a more lenient
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
um uh statutes than we do on food on the
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
this food safety Homestead foods that
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that are experiencing
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
higher rates of reporting of
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
illness so
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to that correlation I
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
can speak to there there are there there
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
is um a website on the association of
 
01:31:33.550 --> 01:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
food Food and Drug officials that covers
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
all Homestead regulations throughout the
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
country and looking at New England New
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is on the more lenient side
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
as to what is allowed and especially
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
without any kind of licensing and
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
inspection um Vermont our neighbor it
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
allows does allow allow some some
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
products to be made in a home kitchen
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
that are considered potentially
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
hazardous but there's also a licensing
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
and inspection process associated with
 
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
that along with a monetary limit as to
 
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
how much they can produce um without a
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
license so so C certainly um I think
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
every single state in the country has
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of Homestead food legislation
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
that um has passed but they're all very
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
very um different in what is allowed
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
especially with without a license at all
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bixby yeah
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
how do uh events like um Church potluck
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
or that sort of thing where people
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
provide make food in their home and then
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
provide it to others for uh a one-off
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
event uh how does that fit in with the
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
current uh food safety
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
laws so in that instance there is an exe
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
current exemption from license Ure for
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
what's called an occasional Food Service
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
event so a product so something like a c
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
a church potluck would fall into that
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
licensing exemption and and therefore
 
01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
there's no U there's no requirements
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
around food that might be even prepared
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
at the event on site or if it was made
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
at someone's home and brought to to the
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
event so that's currently allowed if it
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
fits under that occasional Food Service
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
event definition okay thank you any
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
other questions representative NAB thank
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um I just wonder if you
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
see any Middle Ground here I mean I
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
respect representative kolin's goals
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
around food Security in New Hampshire
 
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
and US producing our own food and I also
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
respect the uh keeping consumers safe
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
and your experience and opinion so um I
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
just wonder if you have any thoughts
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
about like what Vermont's doing is that
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
something that would be safer or a
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
possible path I would say I again
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont is one is more lenient than New
 
01:33:52.470 --> 01:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure if you look at the other
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
New England states we we um we are less
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
restrictive for sure we have a lot of
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about opening that that gateway
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
to allow the the um sandwiches for
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
instance uh you might it might seem easy
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
to to prepare a salad or cut but there's
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know produce has been implicated in
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
several outbreaks it's you have to cut
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
that tomato you're introducing anything
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's on the outside of that knife
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
right directly into it um and also what
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
what temperature is that food to allowed
 
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
to be at again with with just allowing
 
01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
basic um home kitchen we all know homes
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
can be they can have entry to Children
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
pets there's a lot of um factors that
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
could there's a lot of factors that come
 
01:34:39.629 --> 01:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
into play when when making food in a
 
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
home kitchen and then being able to
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
offer it Beyond just your your own home
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
home um
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
Family representative Murray thank you
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you taking my
 
01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
question additionally I wonder if you
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
could speak to I'm thinking about um
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
things like cured meats versus uncured
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
meats and would the disease pathogens be
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
different for one of those if they were
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
held uh at different temperatures or for
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
a different length of time for
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
example so curing meat
 
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
is is a can is a more specialized
 
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
process because with a cured meat it
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
there are instances where it can be held
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
um under without Refrigeration however
 
01:35:23.550 --> 01:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
again that has to be done correctly you
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
have to make sure you're adding the the
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
right amount of salt um it's not that it
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
could couldn't be done safely but there
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
should be some kind of food safety o
 
01:35:34.270 --> 01:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
oversight and again making sure that
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that food is coming from an approved
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
Source um there's a lot of other there's
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of other uh good operating
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
procedures that having that that's why
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
we would require licensing inspection
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
for an activity like
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
that followup go ahead thank you um and
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you particular taking my question
 
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
my other question is around internet
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
sales the non-direct to Consumers um
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
what type of oversight do you have of
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
internet sales for food
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
products as far as as far as once it
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
leaves the state is that in state or out
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
of state so what for food coming into
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
state so I first I'll take the part food
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
coming out of state by internet sales
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
directly to someone's home we have very
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
little to know
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um oversight over that that would fall
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
to the federal government as far as food
 
01:36:28.910 --> 01:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
crossing state lines um when it comes to
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
the out of go those that are Manu
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing um and are selling food
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
with our license it would be the same
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
type of oversight that we would for
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
someone producing um food for a
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant so we're we're looking at
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
their food to make sure um talking to
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
them about how they're preparing their
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
food how they're cleaning their surfaces
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
how they're labeling their food products
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
um we ask that they you know again keep
 
01:36:57.629 --> 01:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
pets away clean their surfaces that that
 
01:36:59.950 --> 01:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
would anything if they're if they're
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
selling um via the Internet they would
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
again have that type of inspection and
 
01:37:06.910 --> 01:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
US Representative
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and your
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
time so I really respect the idea of
 
01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:21.910 align:start position:0%
time so I really respect the idea of
allowing

01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
folks to get their product out the
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
market but I also very much respect your
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
opinion your experience on the the the
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
safety associated with that so on the
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
scale from selling it at a farm stand to
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
selling it at a farmer's market to then
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
maybe a restaurant or a long-term you
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
know grocery store is there a cut off
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
there where that safety is reduced
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
maybe if you're selling it straight on
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
the at a farmer's market versus it's
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
going to sit on the shelf for two weeks
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
at the grocery store and is there a way
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
that that the bill could be modified to
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
reduce that
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
risk over certainly I can speak to over
 
01:38:06.750 --> 01:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
over the past several years is that
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
there there has been a lot of emphasis
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
on letting the consumer make that
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
decision um if they go to a farmer's
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
market they can meet the person that's
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
actually producing the food and and make
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
that decision it's all and there's also
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
a labeling requirement that it has to
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
say it's it's exempt from licensing and
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
inspection once you get removed from
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
that whether it be at a restaurant or a
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
grocery store you you don't have that AB
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer doesn't have that there's
 
01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
not that much transparency even though
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
there is that labeling requirement to to
 
01:38:38.350 --> 01:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
make that decision decision and then
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
also the potential it it could um you
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
know certainly be there could be more
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
people impacted um if you with with um
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
greater volumes of food being produced
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
that c certainly that makes the more the
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
more food you produce the more people
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're serving um so a scale up would be
 
01:39:00.030 --> 01:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know definitely concerning to us
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
from a food safety
 
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:06.159 align:start position:0%
standpoint okay thank you representative
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
kto thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you stated that
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
Homestead licenses have the same require
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
oversight as
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants um I believe that you stated
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
no I I can clarify if you if you'd like
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so we have we have an
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
inspection process but they don't have
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
the same re a homestead food operation
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the same basic equipment
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
requirements as a restaurant would and
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's um and it's inspected less
 
01:39:42.669 --> 01:39:42.679 align:start position:0%
frequently than a a restaurant is as
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
well again there's also the um manager
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
food safety manager certification that's
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
not required for a homestead food
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
operation but it is required for a
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
licensed restaurant or a retail food
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
store follow up uh thank you for that
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
information um so you're saying you said
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
that a homestead is inspected less often
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
than a
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant so because they are limited
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
to making lowrisk Foods they're
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
inspected at we all of our
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
establishments are expected on a
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
risk-based um frequency so you know
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
certainly a a a store um you know just
 
01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
from comparison State a store that's
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
only selling um eggs and bread and milk
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
would be inspected less frequently than
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
a a fullscale grocery department that
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
has you know multiple departments Bakery
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
meat room produce so we have uh we to to
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
dedicate our staff to the highest
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
risk facilities first we have a tier and
 
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
so homee seters are are inspected less
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
frequent than um you know a fullscale
 
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:51.639 align:start position:0%
grocery store
 
01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
um follow up thank you madam chair thank
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
you again thank you for that information
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
um I have heard testimony in this
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
committee before that restaurants uh a
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
lot of them are expected only once every
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
3 years can you expound on the
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
inspection of
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants so our inspection frequency
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
right is rest there are some restaurants
 
01:41:21.589 --> 01:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
depending on the the their menu it every
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
every two to one year the those that are
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
inspected every three years would be
 
01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:29.719 align:start position:0%
your anybody that's not um preparing
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
food for instance like a a pharmacy that
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
they might sell um bacon and meat and
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
eggs but they're not doing any food prep
 
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be a tier that would be
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
inspected every three years one last
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
followup thank you madam chair and is
 
01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
the inspection schedule and what
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants have been inspected when in
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
dates on listed on at the department so
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we could have access to that
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
information so we do have restaurant
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
inspection results available on our
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
website so so that they are it's public
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
information okay thank you
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative Howard um would there
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to make tweaks to
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
this um build to gain your um support or
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
is it is it just too far in in the
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
direction of
 
01:42:19.629 --> 01:42:19.639 align:start position:0%
unsa well I I would like to offer is
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
that we we've had
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
we've made many changes to this the Home
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
Food statute over over time um you know
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
certainly we are amenable to anything
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
that feels that if if those feel there
 
01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be Clarity in so that there's
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
not confusion we would definitely be
 
01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
amenable to um to helping those home
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
food producers that might be making um
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
cream pies and they don't know to to
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
change things so things are more clear
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I I would offer just like that we
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
last year we remove the limit without a
 
01:42:55.870 --> 01:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
license is is that we let um that we
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't make any changes in the this
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
session but explore maybe if if there
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
are things that are unclear is is work
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
to make some change in a future
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
session any other questions I don't see
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
any so um we will move right along we've
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
got four whoops four P cards left
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
here I'd like to call Keen mang Wang to
 
01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:21.669 align:start position:0%
here I'd like to call Keen mang Wang to
to

01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:30.990 --> 01:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
you morning members of the committee my
 
01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
name is Keen Ming Wong I'm the tax
 
01:43:36.189 --> 01:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
policy councel at the New Hampshire
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue um the department
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on this bill
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
however uh just wanted to highlight a
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
potential concern that the department
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
has on the the language on the um the
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements of the bill um
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
here during all the previous discussions
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
before me I believe that the the
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements that's uh in
 
01:43:58.430 --> 01:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
intended in this bill is specifically
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
reference to the homestate food
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
operations license um there is a license
 
01:44:10.270 --> 01:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh for M and rooms tax license where uh
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
operators of meals of taxable meals in
 
01:44:15.790 --> 01:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are required to obtain a
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh M&amp;R license before commencing the
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
operations so the concern that the Dr
 
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
has is the uh the language on lines 24
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
and 25 page one of the bill um and it
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
says that the production and sale of
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
homestate food products in accordance
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
with this subdivision are exempt from
 
01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
all licensing permitting inspection
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
packaging and labeling laws in this
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
state um this is a the the concern is
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
that all licensing would also potenti uh
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
in this state would Encompass the M&amp;R
 
01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:51.109 align:start position:0%
in this state would Encompass the M&amp;R
license

01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh looking back to the previous version
 
01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
well not the previous version but the
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
current version of the uh RSA 143 d a
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh colon 12 um the the current language
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
on that exemption uh is exempt from lure
 
01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:14.679 align:start position:0%
and departmental inspection under this
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
subdivision so the uh the language in
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
the current statute is more limiting to
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
subdivision of home of home state food
 
01:45:26.430 --> 01:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
licensing versus the uh proposed
 
01:45:28.750 --> 01:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
language which expands it to all
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
licensing um in this state that is um
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's just our concerns that we want to
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
highlight to the committee for
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
consideration okay thank you any
 
01:45:40.830 --> 01:45:40.840 align:start position:0%

last

01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:46:02.669 --> 01:46:02.679 align:start position:0%

bill um I'm the prime sponsor of a
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
similar bill that you're going to hear
 
01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.149 align:start position:0%
similar bill that you're going to hear
this

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%

reps who didn't know each other uh came
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
up with such similar bills I think it
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
shows um a
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
need uh for food Freedom uh in this

afternoon
however

01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
um regarding what um the department
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
stated about opening a Gateway they're
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
reluctant to open a
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
Gateway uh that Gateway has been open
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
for a very long time involving
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that have been serving this
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
food potentially hazardous food to
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
thousands of members of the public
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%

photographic evidence of such um type of
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
activity where it was buil as homemade

and delicious for a chicken pie
 
01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:05.390 align:start position:0%
and delicious for a chicken pie
supper

01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
supper
 
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
and as far as separating the homade food
 
01:48:13.229 --> 01:48:13.239 align:start position:0%
producer from the consumer the law
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
currently allows for sales at retail
 
01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:17.189 align:start position:0%
currently allows for sales at retail
food

01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
stores it should be no different from a
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant or a uh any other type of
 
01:48:28.589 --> 01:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
venue uh because it's been in law
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
currently and as far as internet
 
01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
sales the bill both bills go into uh
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
where the food can has to be maintained
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
at uh appropriate temperature and it can
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
only be transported for two hours so I
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
think that limits where you can send
 
01:48:50.629 --> 01:48:50.639 align:start position:0%
food whether it's you know you know
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
shelf stable or potentially
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
hazardous and so that's my only comments
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
for right
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you any
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%

of this bill and we also support

representative ills bill that's going to
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%

at The Institute for justice we're a
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that has helped
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
Homestead um food producers also called
 
01:49:59.470 --> 01:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
commonly Cottage food producers across
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
the country reform restrictive laws that
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
prevent them from earning a living and
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
we support these bills because they
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
expand economic Liberty and
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for Homestead food
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
producers and consumers and they do so
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
in a way that's proven to be safe at The
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice we've studied the
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
effect of Homestead food businesses on
 
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
local economies and communities and
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
researched food safety we've consulted
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
experts we've reviewed CDC data and
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
followed up with health departments and
 
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
states that have expanded their
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
Homestead food laws in ways that are
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
comparable to the approaches that both
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
of these bills take our research
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
confirms that Homestead food is
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
inherently safe for producers and
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
consumers we've also found that
 
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
Homestead food businesses create
 
01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:53.560 align:start position:0%
important opportunities for
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship they help support
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
families and they help bolster local

Iowa Montana North Dakota Oklahoma Utah
 
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:10.920 align:start position:0%

01:51:14.069 --> 01:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
support the local production of homemade
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
food including allowing the sale of

confirmed case of food born illness
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
Wyoming has the oldest law it's been
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
around for almost nine years now and
 
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
there are no cases again of foodborn
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
illness related to the sale of cottage
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%

01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
confirmed Wyoming's laws receive

increasing access to local food and
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity um the these bills bring
 
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
much needed reform to the state's
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
Homestead food producers we commend the
 
01:51:56.589 --> 01:51:56.599 align:start position:0%
committee for all of the work that
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
you've done over the last few years to
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
expand Homestead food but there's a lot
 
01:52:04.430 --> 01:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
of room for improvement still um
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
compared to what other states across the
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
country are now doing um under both
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
bills homemade food must be accurately
 
01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
labeled with all ingredients consumers
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
must also be made aware that the food
 
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
was prepared in a home kitchen that's
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
not regulated consumers have all the
 
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
information that they need to make
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about whether to
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
purchase and consume the food um for
 
01:52:32.790 --> 01:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
these reasons we encourage the committee
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
to support the production and sale of
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
Homestead food and um this bill and also
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
the bill that's going to be heard later
 
01:52:41.310 --> 01:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
this afternoon thank you very much and
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions that
 
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
you may have sure I have a question if
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%

01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%

01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:50.990 align:start position:0%
to the committee or do you have
electronic

01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
testimony so that we can give it to the
 
01:52:56.109 --> 01:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
clerk Madam chair yes ma'am I I did
 
01:52:59.229 --> 01:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
submit um electronic testimony this
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
morning okay thank you did you receive
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
that no I I don't believe I have either
 
01:53:07.149 --> 01:53:07.159 align:start position:0%
oh I'd be happy to follow up and make
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
sure that it was we love to have your
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
written testimony um logged
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
in okay uh any questions from the
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative H Haskins thank
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for your
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
testimony What would label seems like
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that have to be
 
01:53:25.229 --> 01:53:25.239 align:start position:0%
on these labels so what would a label
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
look like that says it's prepared in a
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
home kitchen the label includes the
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
ingredients of the food and the common
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
name that consumers would recognize it
 
01:53:37.390 --> 01:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
as um it also by including the
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
ingredients includes the any potential
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
allergens so consumers would be able to
 
01:53:44.669 --> 01:53:44.679 align:start position:0%
see if there were allergens and then it
 
01:53:48.270 --> 01:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
includes a disclaimer on the label that
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
um says that the food was prepared shed
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
in a home kitchen that's not subject to
 
01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
regulation or that's not licensed and
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
the disclaimer that's required and it
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
has to be word for word is in the bill
 
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
um so so the language would be in the
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
law that the producer would have to
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
follow I see thank you any other
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
Duty um yes uh thank you uh do you have
 
01:54:18.069 --> 01:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
a range of Revenue that um somebody who
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
produces food in their home
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh would make in a year like the lowest
 
01:54:23.950 --> 01:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
highest it it's difficult to to give a
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
range I'll say that most often what we
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
see is that these are very small scale
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
food operations we have surveyed Cottage
 
01:54:38.109 --> 01:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
food producers um Homestead food
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
producers across the country and we
 
01:54:43.229 --> 01:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
found that many are are not making a lot
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
of food um they're earning a few
 
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar extra but it's making a
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
big difference for their families but
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
occasionally we do see Homestead food
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
producers that are able to grow their
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
businesses and often times they get to a
 
01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
point where being in their home doesn't
 
01:54:58.830 --> 01:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
make sense anymore and then they want to
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
take that step to become a commercially
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
licensed business and have all the
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
advantages that a commercial business
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
has um so in a way these laws also
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
create a stepping stone for people to be
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
able to use the homestead law to be able
 
01:55:20.669 --> 01:55:20.679 align:start position:0%
to get to that next step followup yep
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that the existing law
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from doing this and
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
this law is needed so that they could
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
support their families
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
better representative yes I think this
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
law would greatly help people be able to
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
better support their families be able to
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
better um build their businesses the the
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
greatest obstacle that we see in this
 
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
space for food entrepreneurs is that the
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
cost of building a commercial um kitchen
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
is quite expensive um there there's lots
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
of expensive equipment requirements um
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
and and for the small scale production
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
of food it can be very difficult to
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
overcome those costs um as the
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
department mentioned earlier there is
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
the option to rent commercial kitchen
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
space um but doing so is not easy uh
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's often not costeff effective either
 
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
a commercial kitchen space is usually
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
available to be rented a lot of times
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
when commercial kitchen
 
01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
um are not operating so they're not
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
convenient times for people to be able
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
to actually um use them and and again
 
01:56:30.430 --> 01:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
it's another costly
 
01:56:33.310 --> 01:56:33.320 align:start position:0%
option representative Murray thank you
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you for taking
 
01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
my question so one of my questions is I
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
guess you just mentioned commercial
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
kitchen spaces but then wouldn't that
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
have already transcended being a a
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
homestead or a cottage purveyor if
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
you're looking into commercial kitchen
 
01:56:52.750 --> 01:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
space um that sort of is the next step
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
like others have mentioned and so you're
 
01:56:57.750 --> 01:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
already moving into a
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
commercial outfit at that point if
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
you're seeking license or seeking to use
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
those um kitchens to produce more food
 
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
in the at those quantities to sell those
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
amounts of food is that what you're
 
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
repres yes representative it would be um
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
when you're looking to expand your
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
production there's no matter what
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
there's only so much food that a person
 
01:57:23.709 --> 01:57:23.719 align:start position:0%
can make in their home kitchen um so it
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
what we see is people want to expand and
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
when they do they get to a point where
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
they want to open up commercial kitchen
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
space to do so um once their business
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
becomes profitable enough where they can
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
get to that point um but it the nice
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
thing is that it it doesn't require a
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
person to go thousands of dollars into
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
debt before they start out which is a
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times why we see people in in
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
this industry failing when they're
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
starting because the startup cost are so
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
high um to to to sell
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
food represent H Haskins thank you madam
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
chair and again thank you for um taking
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
my question I'm intrigued about this
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
idea of um renting commercial space and
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to see any
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
information that you or others may have
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
about how often this is happening in new
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
hampire what do the costs look like I
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
think that information would be useful
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
if you could provide it sure we'd be
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
happy to look into that and give you
 
01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%

absolutely um
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
we've been in business for about 11
 
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
years um um April makes it 11 years we
 
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
are a commercial kitchen and a business
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
incubator the reason I started the
 
01:59:31.069 --> 01:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
business is because I like
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship and I like food and uh
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
11 years ago I thought of this idea and
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
I did some research and we have a
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
thriving business um at last count we
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
have probably
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
about 45 licenses that have gone through
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
our kitchen a lot of of them have uh
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
opened up their own businesses and moved
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
on from our space but what we do is we
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
work with serious businesses we don't do
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
hobbyist uh these are food food areas
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
that that um that cover the gamut from
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
everything from uh um um Caterers to um
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
to chocolate makers to SAU makers spice
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
makers whatever they' like to do we
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't do a lot uh with uh with Meats
 
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
because we're not a USDA certified space
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
but apart from that any company in the
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that or or Massachusetts
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
that want to start a food business we
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
help them do that we are a certified we
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
are inspected by the town of dairy
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
health inspector we are uh inspected by
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
the FDA they come to do inspections on a
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
regular basis and we've had USDA
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
inspectors in the kitchen as well we
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
maintain a very very clean very sanitary
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
um kitchen and we have all the equipment
 
02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
that someone would need to open their
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
business so we have commercial
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
Restaurant St size um um stoves and
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
ovens um mixers blenders everything is
 
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
clean and sanitized for every user to um
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
to start their production um we don't
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
encourage any type of chemicals in our
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
kitchen all our grease straps are
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
outside the kitchen as well so there's
 
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:17.560 align:start position:0%
no contam there's no possibility for
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
contamination um
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
um what else um we have our inspect our
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
equipment inspected and and and um and
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
maintained on a regular basis and we
 
02:01:32.669 --> 02:01:32.679 align:start position:0%
meet All State Fire and health
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
codes and it's a place for for for
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
businesses to incubate we work with
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
companies that want to expand out so
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
after a couple of years I usually
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
encourage them to move on um especially
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
when they start to get larger than we
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
can support we I try to find places for
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
them to move into other locations
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
facilities on their own because we are
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
just an incubator we don't uh we can't
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
support large businesses we can support
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of people doing a few things
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
and grow their business um but once they
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
start to find employees and they want
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
more more production space more storage
 
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
space we will we're not able to sorry
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're not able to support them because
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
we are an incubator for small startups
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
and may I ask what how much do you
 
02:02:22.510 --> 02:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
charge charge for that service we have a
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
um a different levels actually of
 
02:02:27.270 --> 02:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
pricing we expect because we don't do
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hobbies we want to do serious businesses
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
one of our requirements is we we ask
 
02:02:33.310 --> 02:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
people to be in the kitchen when they
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
start up for about 12 hours a month and
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
we charge $25 an hour for full use of
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
the kitchen once they start to increase
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
their production hours we lower the
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
rates so our lowest rate is $20 an hour
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
and that's for people are in the kitchen
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
for about 32 hours a month we but we
 
02:02:54.910 --> 02:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
have people work at our kitchen for 90
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
hours 120 hours it depends on on their
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
production and we have a lower rate
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
based on that okay thank you
 
02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.069 align:start position:0%
based on that okay thank you
representative

02:03:05.069 --> 02:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
Bixby so would you see this bill as uh
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
potentially creating a pathway for
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
people who might eventually want to take
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
advantage of your kitchen or would you
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
see this bill as being problematic
 
02:03:22.709 --> 02:03:22.719 align:start position:0%
because it circumvents the need for a
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
um the the the the the person who was
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
here before um was saying you know that
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
you can start a small business and in
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
your home and then when you are get to a
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
certain size you won't be able to uh
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
produce at home so you'll have to move
 
02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
into a commercial kitchen um we don't
 
02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.030 align:start position:0%
into a commercial kitchen um we don't
have

02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
um as many issues
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
with um with competing with with home
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
kitchens because there're only certain
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
amount of products at the moment that
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
you can make it home even non-hazardous
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
products come to our kitchen because the
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
space the services that we provide for
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
them to grow um we do we help them with
 
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
labels and packaging and we I hold their
 
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
hand pretty much right to the start of
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
process so what we offer in our kitchen
 
02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:21.430 align:start position:0%
process so what we offer in our kitchen
um

02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.589 --> 02:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
for our
 
02:04:25.069 --> 02:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
businesses we're not going to it's not
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to be this bill is not going to be
 
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
a threat to us because we work we work
 
02:04:31.549 --> 02:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
with serious businesses not those who
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
would just want to see what's out there
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and you know do a hobby type of of
 
02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
of of an Endeavor um I don't I mean I'm
 
02:04:41.629 --> 02:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure this business this will
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
affect our business in some way um but
 
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
there we get so many inquiries on a
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
regular regular basis I'm not sure how
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
this is going to affect our business in
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
the long run um because we do offer a
 
02:04:59.069 --> 02:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
lot more services than a home kitchen
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
can however I would definitely say that
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
this would not be good for the the food
 
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
the local food market or the local food
 
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
industry as such it it it it introduces
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
an element of
 
02:05:16.870 --> 02:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
Sanitation and
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
foodborn illnesses that I would not like
 
02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
to see permeate this this this little
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
market of ours it's not going to
 
02:05:31.069 --> 02:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
be beneficial for New Hampshire local
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
food markets to encourage production in
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
an unsafe
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
environment representative Howard thank
 
02:05:39.870 --> 02:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um do you have more than
 
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
one vendor in your kitchen at a time so
 
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:44.360 align:start position:0%
it's divided up and and they work side
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
by side yes we we have I built the
 
02:05:49.069 --> 02:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
kitchen I designed it to allow up to
 
02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
eight businesses to to produce at the
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
same time um however we've never hit
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
that spot because most of our businesses
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
tend to be uh they're not professionals
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
and they work out of their home kitchens
 
02:06:02.350 --> 02:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
they like a little more Elbow Room so
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
I've limited to about five and since Co
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's just been three and I try to keep
 
02:06:10.109 --> 02:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
it to three sometimes we have four but
 
02:06:11.790 --> 02:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
not more than that each person gets a
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
couple of tables they've got a lot more
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
space we're open 24/7 so anyone can come
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
in at any time and um it works out well
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
because I I I schedule everything so I
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
know exactly what who does what and what
 
02:06:25.709 --> 02:06:25.719 align:start position:0%
space they need and what equipment they
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
need so I make it as convenient and as
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
easy for them to produce in a very clean
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
safe environment that's one of my major
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%

refrigeration and to introduce this
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill this afternoon I invite
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Deborah
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
Elward to come and speak with us again
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%

back and will you be speaking on the
 
03:03:53.469 --> 03:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
bill or the amendment to the bill Madam
 
03:03:56.510 --> 03:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not sure how that works the
 
03:03:58.750 --> 03:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
reason I had to do an amendment was in
 
03:04:01.070 --> 03:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
the final hour before sign off deadline
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:04:04.830 --> 03:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
lsrs a group of representatives were
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
only given four day I was only given
 
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
four days so I was not given the luxury
 
03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
of a
 
03:04:14.950 --> 03:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
redraft and that how the amendment came
 
03:04:18.269 --> 03:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
about so how does that work I would like
 
03:04:22.309 --> 03:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
to well I guess if you um present the
 
03:04:26.389 --> 03:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
the uh premise of your bill and um the
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment which purports to support that
 
03:04:32.630 --> 03:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
or and or what the amendment does to fix
 
03:04:34.750 --> 03:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill I think that covers it
 
03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
oh perfect thank you very much and good
 
03:04:38.070 --> 03:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon am I correct in that
 
03:04:40.830 --> 03:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so essentially
 
03:04:48.670 --> 03:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
essentially the you know your intent was
 
03:04:50.309 --> 03:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
is presumably pretty much the same and
 
03:04:51.990 --> 03:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's just details that are different
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
that differ so uh if you first go over
 
03:04:58.510 --> 03:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
your intent and then uh and then just
 
03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
assume that uh the amendment covers the
 
03:05:03.750 --> 03:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
details in the amendment are the details
 
03:05:05.229 --> 03:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
we should pay attention to that should
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
take care of it perfect thank you very
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
much so again for the record I'm
 
03:05:12.790 --> 03:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative Deborah Elward and I
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
represent the inhabitants of the towns
 
03:05:18.910 --> 03:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
of Andover Danberry Hills Salsbury and
 
03:05:21.550 --> 03:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
Webster I have the greatest privilege of
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
presenting to you house bill
 
03:05:26.750 --> 03:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
1685 which amends the laws governing
 
03:05:26.760 --> 03:05:27.830 align:start position:0%
1685 which amends the laws governing
homemade

03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
homemade
 
03:05:30.229 --> 03:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
foods when I think of New Hampshire I
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
think of a warm fire a homemade Yankee
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
pot roast complete with bra locally
 
03:05:38.309 --> 03:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
raised vegetables and baked beans and
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
ham bread with lots of butter and A
 
03:05:44.710 --> 03:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
clastic Boston cream pie for d dessert I
 
03:05:46.790 --> 03:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
think of the great tradition of New

03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
question how sharing the Bounty of our

03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
illogically prevent the sale of the very
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
same foods to those who want to
 
03:06:26.110 --> 03:06:26.120 align:start position:0%

03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
income honorable committee members we
 
03:06:36.910 --> 03:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
have a chance to change all that an
 
03:06:40.229 --> 03:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make hungry people happy
 
03:06:42.229 --> 03:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
and add the great state of New Hampshire
 
03:06:44.349 --> 03:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
to a growing list list of states
 
03:06:46.510 --> 03:06:46.520 align:start position:0%

03:06:46.520 --> 03:06:47.590 align:start position:0%
engaging in what is called the food
Freedom

03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom
 
03:06:50.830 --> 03:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
Movement but more importantly is seizing
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
this incredible opportunity to make the
 
03:06:55.469 --> 03:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
laws fair and
 
03:06:58.750 --> 03:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable this bill is about food fun
 
03:07:02.670 --> 03:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
families free enterprise and free
 
03:07:05.269 --> 03:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
markets in essence everything for which
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
the great state of New Hampshire stands
 
03:07:12.309 --> 03:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
for so here's what 1685 does it would
 
03:07:14.229 --> 03:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
support fames by giving them more
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
freedom to cook and share their
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted foods with informed
 
03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
and willing consumers to derive or
 
03:07:24.429 --> 03:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
perhaps supplement their
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
incomes in particular it would be a boom
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
to those who might not be able to work
 
03:07:32.710 --> 03:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
fulltime such as stay-at-home moms and
 
03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
caregivers and give aspiring food
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs a chance to start small in
 
03:07:41.710 --> 03:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
their home test the market and build
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
their business
 
03:07:46.349 --> 03:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
the bill would Empower consumers by
 
03:07:48.870 --> 03:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
giving people more choices particularly
 
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
in rural areas where Specialty Foods and
 
03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
healthy meals while in demand can be
 
03:07:58.710 --> 03:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
scarce house bille 1685 would be safe
 
03:08:01.710 --> 03:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
and transparent with required labeling
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
and other food safety protocols
 
03:08:06.710 --> 03:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
implemented at every step in the
 
03:08:10.349 --> 03:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
process and of course House Bill 1685
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
removes restrictions and prohibition
 
03:08:16.950 --> 03:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
that are substantiated as
 
03:08:20.389 --> 03:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
unnecessary such as the ban on producing
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
non shelf stable products in residential
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
kitchens without a license because there
 
03:08:29.229 --> 03:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
is indisputable clear and convincing
 
03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
evidence that homemade foods are
 
03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:32.830 align:start position:0%
evidence that homemade foods are
inherently

03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
inherently
 
03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
safe we know this works because for
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
decades New Hampshire has allowed non
 
03:08:41.190 --> 03:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
shelf stable foods to be produced in
 
03:08:43.870 --> 03:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
residential kitchens which are then
 
03:08:46.309 --> 03:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
served to thousands of people Statewide
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
annually by nonprofits and
 
03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities hosting Food Service
 
03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
events that are exempt from lure in
 
03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
other words there's a double standard
 
03:09:01.710 --> 03:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
that's being applied to homeade food
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
producers this bill includes necessary
 
03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
definitions that support the new
 
03:09:09.910 --> 03:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme which provides a
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
plethora of New Economic opportuni I
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
ities that do not exist under current
 
03:09:19.229 --> 03:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
law but they're already in
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
place given the reality of the
 
03:09:25.309 --> 03:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
marketplace this bill does not limit
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
Regulators ability to enforce the laws
 
03:09:30.910 --> 03:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
but actually it makes Regulators a
 
03:09:32.590 --> 03:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
partner in the
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
process that through Ru making will
 
03:09:39.070 --> 03:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
twice annually Enlighten the populace
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
about the laws and rules governing what
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
I term Artisan food products through
 
03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:46.630 align:start position:0%

media
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
attention which will further assist in
 
03:09:51.389 --> 03:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
the process by creating protocols for
 
03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
non- shelf stable foods which will
 
03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
ensure Optimum
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
compliance I would like to take a
 
03:10:04.269 --> 03:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
second to read from Wyoming's 2023
 
03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:06.040 align:start position:0%

scale homebased food businesses in this
 
03:10:26.670 --> 03:10:26.680 align:start position:0%

choice so given the extent to which this
 
03:12:00.510 --> 03:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill goes to accomplish these goals
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%

House Bill 1685 with Amendment forward
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%

offerings I have a lot of research here
 
03:12:36.510 --> 03:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
too much to go into uh during this
 
03:12:38.870 --> 03:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
hearing but I'd be willing to let the
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
committee researcher peruse it if it
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
would help with the work session uh
 
03:12:46.349 --> 03:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
upcoming I want to thank you for your
 
03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%

03:13:06.670 --> 03:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
1565 for two years I I immersed myself
 
03:13:10.710 --> 03:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
into the homemade food industry I had
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
been a licensed kitchen back in 20 8
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
you'll read this in my testimony and I
 
03:13:16.349 --> 03:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
don't want to be
 
03:13:19.590 --> 03:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
redundant and I made Gourmet

brownies State Fair awardwinning
 
03:13:25.830 --> 03:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
brownies and I took them to farmers
 
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
markets I vended them wherever I could
 
03:13:31.429 --> 03:13:31.439 align:start position:0%

markets from a farm stand that I didn't
 
03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
own I don't have a Farm
 
03:13:55.590 --> 03:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
Stand and um Farmers Market
 
03:13:58.950 --> 03:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
retails and farmers
 
03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
markets so when I had this opportunity
 
03:14:06.030 --> 03:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
to um delve into the
 
03:14:09.150 --> 03:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
laws because I found the rules extremely
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
convoluted and confusing on one hand
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
you're being you can make jam and jelly
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
but you have to undergo process review
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
at the University of Maine for example
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
it's $140 per
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
recipe I have one constituent who makes
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
like 20 different jams and jellies she's
 
03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
been selling them for
 
03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
years what does that tell me it tells me
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
and and she has not undergone process
 
03:14:38.750 --> 03:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
review so it tells me that her food is
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
safe it's a low-risk f food and that it
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
would cost her close to three grand if
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
she complied with the process review
 
03:14:53.309 --> 03:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
requirement um I interviewed vendors
 
03:14:53.319 --> 03:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
requirement um I interviewed vendors
Market

03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
Market
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
managers uh people who wanted to get
 
03:14:59.269 --> 03:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
into the business but felt very
 
03:15:02.710 --> 03:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
intimidated or felt restricted or
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited then I was Finding
 
03:15:06.790 --> 03:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
non-compliance everywhere in the
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
marketplace because banana
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
bread is a low acid food
 
03:15:15.389 --> 03:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
that actually requires State lab testing
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
for water activity in pH
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
levels but everywhere I went I seeing
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
banana bread I was seeing labeling uh
 
03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:27.429 align:start position:0%
banana bread I was seeing labeling uh
Omission

03:15:27.429 --> 03:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
Omission
 
03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh people who just when I asked them I
 
03:15:33.710 --> 03:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
said are you aware of RSA
 
03:15:36.910 --> 03:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
143a and they would either deny it or
 
03:15:38.710 --> 03:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
you could see that they knew about it
 
03:15:41.710 --> 03:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
but they claimed they didn't and so
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
we've had a type of Black Market if you
 
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
will of these
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
Foods uh and I made record requests of
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS and they couldn't produce any
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
records over the past twoe period of
 
03:16:01.550 --> 03:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
food born illnesses being traced back
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
to food produced in uh a
 
03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:08.110 align:start position:0%
to food produced in uh a
homestead

03:16:08.110 --> 03:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.550 --> 03:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
capacity then I kept looking at the
 
03:16:11.560 --> 03:16:13.150 align:start position:0%
capacity then I kept looking at the
definition

03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
of occasional Food Service
 
03:16:18.750 --> 03:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
event and that's where
 
03:16:18.760 --> 03:16:20.590 align:start position:0%
event and that's where
nonprofits

03:16:20.590 --> 03:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofits
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
schools are exempt from Food Service
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
lure that is what we're talking about
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:36.269 --> 03:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
sale holiday events national uh old home
 
03:16:39.429 --> 03:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
days where food is made in residential
 
03:16:41.429 --> 03:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
kitchens taken to a Comm Community
 
03:16:41.439 --> 03:16:42.830 align:start position:0%

03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
dinner
 
03:16:45.630 --> 03:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
and serve to people they're potentially
 
03:16:47.950 --> 03:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
hazardous we're talking you know chicken
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
turkey ham uh barbecue cream pies
 
03:16:55.469 --> 03:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
pumpkin pies salads every type of
 
03:16:58.590 --> 03:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
homemade food you can think
 
03:17:02.590 --> 03:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
of yet the department came back and was
 
03:17:05.510 --> 03:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
unre could not be responsive to a
 
03:17:08.269 --> 03:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
request for records that
 
03:17:12.229 --> 03:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
these Food Service events were causing
 
03:17:12.239 --> 03:17:13.469 align:start position:0%
these Food Service events were causing
foodborn

03:17:13.469 --> 03:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
foodborn
 
03:17:17.070 --> 03:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
illness so it's this really AA gotcha
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
moment this is a double standard how can
 
03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
you possibly not regulate potentially
 
03:17:25.670 --> 03:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
hazardous foods here that serve to the
 
03:17:28.030 --> 03:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
public just because it's a nonprofit or
 
03:17:28.040 --> 03:17:28.750 align:start position:0%
public just because it's a nonprofit or
a

03:17:28.750 --> 03:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
school and yet the same woman making the
 
03:17:34.870 --> 03:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
pie for this nonprofit event can't turn
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
around and sell it for
 
03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
income so that's when I contacted the
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
Institute of Justice because we ra
 
03:17:47.150 --> 03:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
as a C+ for food Freedom uh based on the
 
03:17:50.030 --> 03:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
institute's research and I said what's
 
03:17:52.750 --> 03:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
it going to take to bring this up to an
 
03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
A and so they helped Mr uh rep kulan and
 
03:18:00.269 --> 03:18:00.279 align:start position:0%
myself with the
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
language but I wanted to see it very
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
clear um that there were food safety
 
03:18:10.110 --> 03:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
protocols not buried in administrative
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
rules I wanted to see it in the law that
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
was easy to
 
03:18:18.550 --> 03:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
comprehend that's not to say that
 
03:18:21.389 --> 03:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
through Ru making the department won't
 
03:18:22.510 --> 03:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:18:26.750 --> 03:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
hand in informing consumers how to
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
safely process and handle low acid foods
 
03:18:38.189 --> 03:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
dairy so some of the differences first
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
of all is change Ching the the name of
 
03:18:47.590 --> 03:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
this industry to Artisan food
 
03:18:49.830 --> 03:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
operations and I say this because the
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
word Homestead skews in favor of farmers
 
03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
not all homemade food operators are are
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
homesteading which is living a lifestyle
 
03:19:00.399 --> 03:19:02.110 align:start position:0%
homesteading which is living a lifestyle
of

03:19:02.110 --> 03:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:19:05.110 --> 03:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency and quite frankly
 
03:19:06.910 --> 03:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
that's what these people want to be
 
03:19:10.110 --> 03:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
called take the Canan farmers and
 
03:19:12.670 --> 03:19:12.680 align:start position:0%
Artisan Market
 
03:19:16.670 --> 03:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
so I outlined uh ad nauseum the
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
03:19:20.670 --> 03:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
artisan and it being uh about
 
03:19:22.990 --> 03:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
handcrafting a
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
good um
 
03:19:29.309 --> 03:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
because I feel it will uplifted industry
 
03:19:33.070 --> 03:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
everyone it's a relatable descriptive
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
term and somehow I just can't relate the
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
word Homestead to an elegantly decorated
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
special occasion cake dainty Petty
 
03:19:47.710 --> 03:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
fors uh and I think we need to make it
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
more General to what this industry
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
really is so I'm I'm introducing the
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
term Artisan in place of
 
03:20:01.189 --> 03:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
Homestead I attacked the definitions in
 
03:20:01.199 --> 03:20:02.070 align:start position:0%
Homestead I attacked the definitions in
this

03:20:02.070 --> 03:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:20:02.080 --> 03:20:03.630 align:start position:0%
this
law

03:20:03.630 --> 03:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like the word
 
03:20:08.469 --> 03:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
establishment and event were
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
interchangeable throughout it was very
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
confusing so I wanted to make it clear
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
that you have licensed establishments
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
and then you have Artisan food
 
03:20:22.269 --> 03:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
operations you have occasional Food
 
03:20:22.279 --> 03:20:23.750 align:start position:0%
operations you have occasional Food
Service

03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
Service
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
functions um and temporary sales and uh
 
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
sales events and
 
03:20:33.229 --> 03:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
venues and I went into great
 
03:20:36.590 --> 03:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
detail to make it so you could sell
 
03:20:38.630 --> 03:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
basically anywhere and everywhere
 
03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
following the
 
03:20:44.510 --> 03:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
same format as as current law now much
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
to my chagrin talking with uh Miss
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
Colleen Smith from HHS this morning
 
03:20:56.910 --> 03:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
about um a woman debuting her business
 
03:20:58.870 --> 03:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
that was featured in a local newspaper
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
at a craft
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
fair and I'm looking at retail food
 
03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
store Farm Stand farmers market and from
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
your residence and I don't see craft
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
fair in there at all and so this morning
 
03:21:16.710 --> 03:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
I was told that they don't
 
03:21:19.710 --> 03:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit Foods being sold at a craft
 
03:21:22.269 --> 03:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
fair well does that mean I can sell it
 
03:21:27.229 --> 03:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
at a at a non food retail store does it
 
03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean I can sell at a local event that's
 
03:21:34.269 --> 03:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
not a farmers's market well apparently
 
03:21:34.279 --> 03:21:35.870 align:start position:0%
not a farmers's market well apparently
so

03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
so these four what I call authorized
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
places um I believe has been a detriment
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
to people entering into the
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
industry a retail food stor such as a
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
major grocery store will take homemade
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
foods but you have to keep up with the
 
03:22:00.110 --> 03:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
demand and the
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
average residential kitchen can't can't
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
keep up with that kind of
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
demand farmers markets let's face
 
03:22:13.229 --> 03:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
it um in the farmer Market directory for
 
03:22:16.750 --> 03:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
2023 published by the Department of
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture there's only 25 listings
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's 204
 
03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that means one farmer's
 
03:22:27.670 --> 03:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
market for every eight towns not only
 
03:22:30.510 --> 03:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
does going to a farmers's market take
 
03:22:32.950 --> 03:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
you away from your local customer
 
03:22:36.389 --> 03:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
base uh but it not all farmers markets
 
03:22:39.150 --> 03:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
will take on all homemade food producers
 
03:22:42.429 --> 03:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a public market it's it's not a
 
03:22:46.030 --> 03:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
publicly operated Market it's it's
 
03:22:48.189 --> 03:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
operated by private
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and again not everybody owns
 
03:22:53.469 --> 03:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
a farm stand so I created the definition
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
of residential roadside
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
stand in rural areas everything is sold
 
03:23:03.189 --> 03:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
roadside and I've seen um
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
unenclosed uh Farm
 
03:23:07.389 --> 03:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
stands uh
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
roadside and I don't see any difference
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
in putting an honor System
 
03:23:15.389 --> 03:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
cart at the end of my road and selling
 
03:23:18.910 --> 03:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
my homemade breads every day uh so I
 
03:23:22.030 --> 03:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
went ahead and and made that a
 
03:23:24.550 --> 03:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
definition um I
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:37.189 --> 03:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
place and then there is the temporary
 
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
food sales event or venue which means a
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
temporary event or series of events or
 
03:23:44.670 --> 03:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
venues that are open to the public by
 
03:23:46.189 --> 03:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
whatever name
 
03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
advertise where food including Artisan
 
03:23:51.229 --> 03:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
food products are sold to
 
03:23:54.150 --> 03:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
Consumers this is because like I said
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
you can have the church fair old home
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
days even voting day is where food is is
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
sold you go into town hall and there's
 
03:24:05.349 --> 03:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
this banquet table full of food that's
 
03:24:05.359 --> 03:24:06.389 align:start position:0%
this banquet table full of food that's
being

03:24:06.389 --> 03:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
being
 
03:24:09.070 --> 03:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
vended um so there's no way to list all
 
03:24:11.790 --> 03:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
of them and Farmers Market would fall
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
under temporary food sales eventor
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
venue we included third-party
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
vendor um where I can
 
03:24:26.830 --> 03:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
ask my friend down the road who who owns
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
a a gift shop uh if she'd like to sell
 
03:24:30.479 --> 03:24:32.189 align:start position:0%
a a gift shop uh if she'd like to sell
my

03:24:32.189 --> 03:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:24:32.199 --> 03:24:34.670 align:start position:0%
my
product

03:24:34.670 --> 03:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
product
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
um we even included the ability to sell
 
03:24:40.710 --> 03:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh from a mobile food unit if you're
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
exclusively selling Artisan
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
Foods so then I changed occasional Food
 
03:24:52.830 --> 03:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:56.070 --> 03:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
function just to differentiate between
 
03:24:58.910 --> 03:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
these different categories now if what
 
03:25:01.710 --> 03:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
dhh says is true none of these
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
definitions are NE
 
03:25:05.630 --> 03:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
necessary just take it all out and say
 
03:25:07.189 --> 03:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
you can sell wherever you want whenever
 
03:25:07.199 --> 03:25:08.389 align:start position:0%
you can sell wherever you want whenever
you

03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:25:15.229 --> 03:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
want but um not knowing that at the time
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
we created the the function which would
 
03:25:21.070 --> 03:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
even allow private chefs and Caterers to
 
03:25:23.870 --> 03:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
make meals in their home because right
 
03:25:26.389 --> 03:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
now the only way they are exempt or
 
03:25:29.710 --> 03:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
private Chef is exempt from lure is
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
where they make the food they make the
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
food in their client's residence they're
 
03:25:36.750 --> 03:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to prep it at
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
home and this would allow that to happen
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
as long as they maintain temperature
 
03:25:45.150 --> 03:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
control in transporting it to their
 
03:25:45.160 --> 03:25:46.990 align:start position:0%
control in transporting it to their
client's

03:25:46.990 --> 03:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
client's
 
03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:51.670 align:start position:0%
client's
location

03:25:51.670 --> 03:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:56.309 --> 03:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
um so then it was food safety
 
03:26:01.469 --> 03:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
important that it be in law rather than
 
03:26:04.479 --> 03:26:06.349 align:start position:0%
important that it be in law rather than
in

03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:26:09.790 --> 03:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
Rule and so an artisan food product
 
03:26:12.269 --> 03:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
means all food
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to soft
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
beverages low acid acidified and
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
fermented food that's produced by an
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
artisan food operation only within the
 
03:26:25.590 --> 03:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
home kitchen of a person's primary
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
residence if canned canned using the
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
method so this is um important because
 
03:26:39.790 --> 03:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
there's water bath canning there's
 
03:26:42.150 --> 03:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
pressure canning and depending on the
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
type of food depends on which method you
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
use for food
 
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
safety um we also included a disclaimer
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
that uh this section shall not absolve a
 
03:26:57.469 --> 03:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
producer from
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
liability this allows delivery by a
 
03:27:00.479 --> 03:27:02.070 align:start position:0%
liability this allows delivery by a
third-party

03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
third-party
 
03:27:06.990 --> 03:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
carrier it allows uh telephone internet
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
sales and again
 
03:27:10.319 --> 03:27:11.990 align:start position:0%
sales and again
in

03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:27:17.389 --> 03:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
section um a12 Roman 3
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
C if potentially hazardous Artisan
 
03:27:23.189 --> 03:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
products are transported before final
 
03:27:25.950 --> 03:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
delivery to the consumer or thirdparty
 
03:27:28.110 --> 03:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
vendor the part the food shall be
 
03:27:29.950 --> 03:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
maintained at an appropriate temperature
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
during transport cannot be transported
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
more than once and cannot be transported
 
03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
for longer than two hours and after
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
reaching its final destination shall be
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
maintained at an appropriate temperature
 
03:27:44.710 --> 03:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
at all times
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
thereafter so if you want to put a
 
03:27:49.630 --> 03:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
display refrigerated display case in a
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
retail store that features your
 
03:27:54.710 --> 03:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
cheesecake this would
 
03:27:57.389 --> 03:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
apply uh you certainly wouldn't want to
 
03:27:58.710 --> 03:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
be transporting
 
03:27:58.720 --> 03:28:00.630 align:start position:0%
be transporting
cheesecake

03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
cheesecake
 
03:28:06.030 --> 03:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
um selling it to California for
 
03:28:09.870 --> 03:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
example so then I took on the word uh on
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
sampling and through throughout the
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
amendment you'll see the word sampled
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
sampled sampled because in the um
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
administrative rule no excuse me publish
 
03:28:21.790 --> 03:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
guidance by
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
UNH says that you can't sample unless
 
03:28:28.710 --> 03:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
you cut whatever it is into bread into
 
03:28:30.790 --> 03:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
pieces and put it into a plastic cup
 
03:28:33.950 --> 03:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
with a cap and I'm sorry but Sam's Club
 
03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't even do that they lay it out on
 
03:28:37.790 --> 03:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
on a
 
03:28:41.229 --> 03:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
napkin and I think that um single serves
 
03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
spoons for jellies on a cracker that's
 
03:28:48.750 --> 03:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
just widely accepted method of
 
03:28:51.309 --> 03:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
sampling uh if I had potentially had if
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
I had award-winning CH chili that I was
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
selling uh at in an
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
event i' probably use an inverter bring
 
03:29:01.710 --> 03:29:01.720 align:start position:0%
my crock pot with the hot chili in it
 
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
and I'd have it in Deli containers in a
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
in a cooler with ice and so I sent a
 
03:29:10.349 --> 03:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
photo array uh that gives an example of
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
a a
 
03:29:11.760 --> 03:29:13.309 align:start position:0%
a a
agricultural

03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
vendor who uh does this events so if
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
they can do it if they can sell
 
03:29:22.189 --> 03:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food at events why
 
03:29:28.189 --> 03:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
producer so then came the the statements
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
labels that if it's low acid acidified
 
03:29:38.429 --> 03:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
or fermented it should be clearly
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
labeled uh with refrigerate after
 
03:29:45.189 --> 03:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
opening but if it requires maintaining
 
03:29:48.590 --> 03:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
time and temperature control for
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
safety I think I invented this this
 
03:29:53.189 --> 03:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
statement I've never seen it in the
 
03:29:55.990 --> 03:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace in my life but it would say
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
consume immediately or refrigerate after
 
03:30:02.550 --> 03:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
purchase after purchase eat it now or
 
03:30:05.070 --> 03:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
get it home into a refrigerator that
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
tells you it's
 
03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
perishable it should be on
 
03:30:13.189 --> 03:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
every hamburger container that you don't
 
03:30:15.189 --> 03:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
leave it in the back seat for eight
 
03:30:19.229 --> 03:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
hours and eat it so I was really proud
 
03:30:19.239 --> 03:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
hours and eat it so I was really proud
of

03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
that um and I I am the former manager of
 
03:30:27.150 --> 03:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
our family bakery we had a wholesale
 
03:30:30.269 --> 03:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
retail bakery in northern
 
03:30:30.279 --> 03:30:31.790 align:start position:0%
retail bakery in northern
Virginia

03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
Virginia
 
03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
um and so I've been in the food business
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
on and off throughout my
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
life um it
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
allows offering um for sale out of bulk
 
03:30:49.910 --> 03:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
um a cake you can have it in a pan and
 
03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
you can
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
serve on a napkin and people can consume
 
03:31:00.990 --> 03:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
it where they
 
03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:02.910 align:start position:0%
it where they
are

03:31:02.910 --> 03:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:31:05.349 --> 03:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
um you must have a placard that's
 
03:31:07.870 --> 03:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
displayed at the point of sale if you're
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
not going to do a
 
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:11.670 align:start position:0%
not going to do a
label

03:31:11.670 --> 03:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
label
 
03:31:15.070 --> 03:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
and then you also have to have
 
03:31:19.110 --> 03:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
um your information your ingredients Etc
 
03:31:21.630 --> 03:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
uh on on your
 
03:31:24.269 --> 03:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
website and if you sell by telephone or
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
custom order you have to orally disclose
 
03:31:27.680 --> 03:31:29.389 align:start position:0%
custom order you have to orally disclose
allergens

03:31:29.389 --> 03:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
allergens
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
ingredients uh fact that it's made in a
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
in a residential unlicensed kitchen as
 
03:31:36.120 --> 03:31:37.910 align:start position:0%
in a residential unlicensed kitchen as
well

03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
now you'll see that that there's a
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
statement may contain allergens rather
 
03:31:49.469 --> 03:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.349 --> 03:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
allergens the average homemade food
 
03:31:55.070 --> 03:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
producer doesn't necessarily know there
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
are nine major
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
allergens and there is a risk of
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination if you're making
 
03:32:03.950 --> 03:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
peanut butter cookies in the same
 
03:32:06.910 --> 03:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen with your chocolate
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
chip you want people the you want people
 
03:32:13.950 --> 03:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
to know that chocolate chip cookie you
 
03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
know may may have been cross
 
03:32:18.389 --> 03:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
contaminated with peanut butter not to
 
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
serve it to children or if you have a
 
03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
food allergy in other words be very
 
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
careful before you buy a homemade food
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
03:32:31.110 --> 03:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
ingredients um one homemade producer put
 
03:32:33.030 --> 03:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
lactose as an
 
03:32:35.070 --> 03:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
allergen and for the life of me I
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't understand why uh lactose is a
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
sugar that comes from milk
 
03:32:45.469 --> 03:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
um but it's not listed by the government
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
as a major
 
03:32:51.309 --> 03:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
allergen and she also put oatmeal as an
 
03:32:54.750 --> 03:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
allergen and I don't see that oatmeal is
 
03:32:58.229 --> 03:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
listed as an allergen so I I don't want
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
to leave it to
 
03:33:03.950 --> 03:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
um the homemade food producer to know
 
03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
what these major allergens are and I
 
03:33:09.670 --> 03:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
think all products coming out of a home
 
03:33:11.910 --> 03:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen should say make contain
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
allergens also if the product contains
 
03:33:17.229 --> 03:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
alcohol it has to be produced in
 
03:33:20.229 --> 03:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA 175 colon
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
5-a which says you uh has certain
 
03:33:26.910 --> 03:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh the product can you have
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
to get the alcohol from a New Hampshire
 
03:33:33.349 --> 03:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
liquor store it cannot contain more than
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
6% alcohol by
 
03:33:38.670 --> 03:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
volume and you can't serve it to
 
03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
children people under 20 21 if the
 
03:33:44.910 --> 03:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
temperature is 61° or something like
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
that it's it's kind of strange but I
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
thought it was important to reference
 
03:33:53.189 --> 03:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
because in the record request I got back
 
03:33:53.199 --> 03:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
because in the record request I got back
from

03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:33:57.189 --> 03:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
HHS one of the complaints concerned a
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
product that contained alcohol so I
 
03:34:02.309 --> 03:34:02.319 align:start position:0%
thought it was
 
03:34:02.319 --> 03:34:07.309 align:start position:0%
thought it was
important

03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.110 --> 03:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
um local governments shall not regulate
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
artisan food operations in a manner that
 
03:34:15.150 --> 03:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
is more restrictive than required by
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
state or federal law so we do have the
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
self- inspecting cities
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
um we have municipalities that issue
 
03:34:25.359 --> 03:34:27.429 align:start position:0%
um we have municipalities that issue
permits

03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
permits
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we are are opposed to these
 
03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
governments uh making
 
03:34:39.389 --> 03:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
up restrictive rules that are not
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
necessary then I've asked the department
 
03:34:45.309 --> 03:34:45.319 align:start position:0%
to um publish links to all the
 
03:34:49.389 --> 03:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
applicable laws and rules and remove
 
03:34:51.710 --> 03:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
broken links and outdated information
 
03:34:53.790 --> 03:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
that is just permeated all over the
 
03:34:57.229 --> 03:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
Internet it still has the sales
 
03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
still talks about this process
 
03:35:07.189 --> 03:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
review uh on one hand it says yes you
 
03:35:09.790 --> 03:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
can make jams and jellies over here but
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
no it has that you have to have process
 
03:35:15.309 --> 03:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
review and then you might need a
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
homestead food license and I just can't
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
make hner tale of the published guidance
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's out there and then finally under
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
the certified food protection
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
manager um Homestead food operations are
 
03:35:33.189 --> 03:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
currently exempt and it just changed the
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
the word to Artisan food operation and
 
03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
under ruem it gives the
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
department um again the ability to
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
create rules regarding the safe
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
processing handling of low acid foods
 
03:35:48.910 --> 03:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
dairy product meat meat food products
 
03:35:51.790 --> 03:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
and byproducts poultry and poultry food
 
03:35:52.950 --> 03:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
products and
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
byproducts I borrowed all that language
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
from rep kulan's
 
03:36:02.670 --> 03:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
Bill meaning no disrespect I was trying
 
03:36:05.309 --> 03:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
to make house bills
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
1685 um
 
03:36:10.950 --> 03:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
include all the different language from
 
03:36:15.630 --> 03:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
both bills so with that I'll I'll take
 
03:36:15.640 --> 03:36:16.510 align:start position:0%
both bills so with that I'll I'll take
any

03:36:16.510 --> 03:36:16.520 align:start position:0%

03:36:49.870 --> 03:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
morning it seems to me we have two
 
03:36:49.880 --> 03:36:50.710 align:start position:0%
morning it seems to me we have two
pretty

03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:36:55.469 --> 03:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
much similar bills wh which one in your
 
03:36:59.710 --> 03:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
opinion would be more applicable and
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.910 --> 03:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
1565 well on one hand if what HHH says
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
is true
 
03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
that you can sell homemade shelf stable
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
homemade foods anywhere and everywhere
 
03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:19.910 align:start position:0%
homemade foods anywhere and everywhere
all

03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
what representative kulan bill says in
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
addition to the poultry meat dairy
 
03:37:36.110 --> 03:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
products and I I'm good with that
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
anything that that allows uh food
 
03:37:42.349 --> 03:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
Freedom I'm good with that
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
but interviewing people who are confused
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
by the
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
law I feel they need a little bit more
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
information a little bit more step
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
bystep uh more
 
03:37:57.239 --> 03:38:00.030 align:start position:0%
bystep uh more
thorough

03:38:00.030 --> 03:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
thorough
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
information because it's going to be
 
03:38:04.750 --> 03:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
peer pressure it's going to be event
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
managers it's going to be retail food
 
03:38:12.950 --> 03:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
stores that are looking to have those
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
products comply with the
 
03:38:15.239 --> 03:38:18.469 align:start position:0%
products comply with the
law

03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
and I really think I combined
 
03:38:25.870 --> 03:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
both uh bills because Institute of
 
03:38:28.110 --> 03:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
Justice provided much of the language in
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
both bills but I went further to be more
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
clear because to me that 1565 is to me
 
03:38:39.550 --> 03:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
vague it says licensed restaurants and
 
03:38:41.710 --> 03:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
grocery stores
 
03:38:44.030 --> 03:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
and so one thinks well they they said
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
license you know restaurants and grocery
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
stores is that the only place I can sell
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
so I know I I'm a regulatory um nut I I
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
served on our uh Advisory Board in
 
03:39:01.229 --> 03:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
Virginia I was appointed to a four-year
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
term I helped
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules and laws relative to
 
03:39:12.150 --> 03:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
the private investigator industry so
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
so I like it to be clear and concise and
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think that mine is thank you
 
03:39:21.189 --> 03:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:39:22.750 --> 03:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
03:39:25.030 --> 03:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
on page two of your amendments where
 
03:39:27.389 --> 03:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
you're referring starting at lines um
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
three through
 
03:39:32.830 --> 03:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
eight um can you explain to me how the
 
03:39:35.309 --> 03:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
language that you're proposing versus
 
03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
the federal language under the uh Bill
 
03:39:39.389 --> 03:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
Emerson Good Samaritan act may or may
 
03:39:42.469 --> 03:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
not I did I missed
 
03:39:45.110 --> 03:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
that can you explain to me how the
 
03:39:47.910 --> 03:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
language you are proposing under lines
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
three through eight on page two may or
 
03:39:54.389 --> 03:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
may not conflict with the bill Emerson
 
03:39:56.389 --> 03:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
Goods meritan
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
act I I got to the word conflict I
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear you ma'am representative I
 
03:40:03.630 --> 03:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear do I need to turn up my
 
03:40:05.630 --> 03:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
microphone after um maybe I don't know
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
or speak closer to the mic sure I was
 
03:40:11.389 --> 03:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
just asking how um is that
 
03:40:14.030 --> 03:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
better how the language that you
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
proposed in those lines may or may not
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with the federal Bill Emerson
 
03:40:22.590 --> 03:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
Good Samaritan act I I'm unfamiliar with
 
03:40:22.600 --> 03:40:23.429 align:start position:0%
Good Samaritan act I I'm unfamiliar with
that

03:40:23.429 --> 03:40:23.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank
 
03:40:28.990 --> 03:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
you could you repeat the name of that
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
bill or act it's the bill Emerson Good
 
03:40:32.479 --> 03:40:37.590 align:start position:0%
bill or act it's the bill Emerson Good
Samaritan

03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
act do you know when that was adopted at
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
all I can go back and look as early as
 
03:40:46.590 --> 03:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
1996 I think and then it may even go
 
03:40:48.269 --> 03:40:48.279 align:start position:0%
back further than that but it is still
 
03:40:51.150 --> 03:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
Fally recognized okay thank
 
03:40:56.830 --> 03:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%

food protection section and I'm joined
 
03:41:48.790 --> 03:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
Again by Katrina Hansen who is our chief

03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:54.920 align:start position:0%

03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
illness um before before you continue um
 
03:42:01.950 --> 03:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
just interest interested to know if you
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
were familiar with the amendment that
 
03:42:08.110 --> 03:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
representative Elward presented I was re
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
I did receive a copy of the amendment um
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
after presentation of the last bill so I
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
I had an opportunity to per peruse it
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you so I won't
 
03:42:21.550 --> 03:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
repeat um many of our talking points
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we used in previous testim
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
testimony for 1565 I did just want to
 
03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
highlight to the committee um the
 
03:42:32.269 --> 03:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
definition of a temporary event so that
 
03:42:34.750 --> 03:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
that is or an occasional Food Service
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
event those are not um inspected or
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state's jurisdiction but
 
03:42:42.030 --> 03:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
I do want to recognize that many of the
 
03:42:44.389 --> 03:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
self- inspecting cities and towns they
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
do do a temporary permit or an
 
03:42:49.630 --> 03:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
occasional permit so some of those Food
 
03:42:52.269 --> 03:42:52.279 align:start position:0%
Services um are still under some
 
03:42:54.189 --> 03:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
inspection so so just wanted to make
 
03:42:56.269 --> 03:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
sure the committee was aware of that and
 
03:42:59.110 --> 03:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
that if this legislation were to pass
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
they those communities wouldn't be
 
03:43:04.110 --> 03:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to regulate those events under a
 
03:43:04.120 --> 03:43:06.750 align:start position:0%
allowed to regulate those events under a
temporary

03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
permit the bill as written will make
 
03:43:09.520 --> 03:43:10.389 align:start position:0%
permit the bill as written will make
regular

03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
regular
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
very very difficult while it does allow
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
the department to do Ru making and to um
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
have a fine with non-compliance it will
 
03:43:23.070 --> 03:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
be it's it's already very difficult for
 
03:43:25.990 --> 03:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
us to enforce the standards for existing
 
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
Homestead regulations because many of
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
these products are offered direct from
 
03:43:32.990 --> 03:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
the home or at farmers markets or um
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
venues that we typically don't regulate
 
03:43:36.790 --> 03:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned in previous
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
testimony we do receive consumer
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
complaints and we do react to those but
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
it is of often difficult to make do
 
03:43:46.590 --> 03:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement we have no licensing ability
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
of those we don't we can't hold a
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
license back be for non-compliance it's
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
very very difficult we're really relying
 
03:43:58.510 --> 03:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
on um the producer to uh act in
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
accordance with the law on their own
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
accord it I I won't I you know once
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
homestad licensing has was removed it
 
03:44:08.510 --> 03:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
does make our enforcement very very
 
03:44:10.349 --> 03:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
difficult so I just wanted to highlight
 
03:44:13.590 --> 03:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
that to the committee and this to us
 
03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
would um make a a a more risky situation
 
03:44:20.349 --> 03:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
by allowing again higher risk foods that
 
03:44:22.269 --> 03:44:22.279 align:start position:0%
don't that do require refrigeration for
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
safety or canned foods that have a
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
higher risk at making someone sick if
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
done if done um produced in a manner uh
 
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
in a an unsafe manner um certainly there
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
is an obligation when providing food to
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
the public to ensure it's safe we do ask
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
that um Homestead operations or any
 
03:44:46.469 --> 03:44:46.479 align:start position:0%
operation that is not using a
 
03:44:48.429 --> 03:44:48.439 align:start position:0%
standardized recipe that it's in their
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
best interest to conduct a process
 
03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
review this is an assurance from a that
 
03:44:54.189 --> 03:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
this product and their process has been
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
reviewed by a food safety professional
 
03:45:00.429 --> 03:45:00.439 align:start position:0%
to give them good advice this again the
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
consequences of improperly processing
 
03:45:05.349 --> 03:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
especially in acidified or low acid food
 
03:45:08.110 --> 03:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
could be deadly and it it really um
 
03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:11.439 align:start position:0%
these making food for the public is is
 
03:45:14.590 --> 03:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
um should have some food safety
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility that comes with that our
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
work is preventative we are instilling
 
03:45:20.750 --> 03:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
regulations in place to prevent food
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
born illness and this legislation of
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
passed would put us uh it would really
 
03:45:27.149 --> 03:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
make that very very difficult for us to
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
to enforce and I'm happy to take any
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.520 --> 03:45:37.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:45:37.870 --> 03:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:41.790 --> 03:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
um Community Food food banks where they
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
have meals for the
 
03:45:48.309 --> 03:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
community uh people who are
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
um who are looking for you know meals
 
03:45:51.600 --> 03:45:52.309 align:start position:0%
um who are looking for you know meals
that

03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:45:56.070 --> 03:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
are are those uh kitchens are those
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
Community uh food kitchens regulated and
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
licensed so by Statute soup kitchens are
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
exempt from our food licensing and
 
03:46:07.510 --> 03:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
inspection we have we do try to provide
 
03:46:10.550 --> 03:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
best guidance and on on good safe
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
practices but it's it's not enforceable
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
also I want to mention just UNH
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
extension they do a a free food safety
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
training for anyone that's working in a
 
03:46:23.950 --> 03:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
in a uh food pantry or similar
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
establishment so seeing as these um food
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
kitchens soup kitchens are
 
03:46:33.359 --> 03:46:34.870 align:start position:0%
kitchens soup kitchens are
providing

03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
providing
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
possibly you know uh whatever the
 
03:46:41.110 --> 03:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
language is for
 
03:46:45.630 --> 03:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
for possibly dangerous foods uh to a
 
03:46:49.149 --> 03:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
great number of people on a daily basis
 
03:46:53.790 --> 03:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
how is that different from say another
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
person wanting to offer their their uh
 
03:47:03.070 --> 03:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
culinary foods to uh to the public so
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
what I can offer is that I wouldn't say
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
that that's a it's a
 
03:47:09.710 --> 03:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
risk-free situation I think there is a
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
Gap there that there isn't oversight on
 
03:47:14.269 --> 03:47:14.279 align:start position:0%
these particular venues but as I
 
03:47:16.630 --> 03:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned by Statute they're exempt from
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
our license and inspection do you
 
03:47:22.110 --> 03:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
believe they should be inspected I
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
believe that they should H I believe
 
03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
that they should have the best
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
information available from food practice
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
from food safety practices these
 
03:47:32.590 --> 03:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
situations can be a little they might
 
03:47:34.590 --> 03:47:34.600 align:start position:0%
not fit in the box of the same box
 
03:47:37.149 --> 03:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory box as our normal retail
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
stores and or restaurants and that they
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
might not have a consistent staff but
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that um there there always
 
03:47:46.630 --> 03:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
could be benefit from education
 
03:47:49.030 --> 03:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities and you just to make sure
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
refrigerators are working correctly um
 
03:47:53.590 --> 03:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
it it there is a there's a lot of
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
difficulty around that I think that's an
 
03:47:58.149 --> 03:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
issue that um merits further exploration
 
03:48:00.670 --> 03:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
for sure so do you also uh require
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
licensing for like senior centers who
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
have uh lunches provided that they they
 
03:48:08.149 --> 03:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
offer lunches so senior meal sites they
 
03:48:10.510 --> 03:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
do fall under our license well they do
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you any other
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
Murray um thank you madam chair um if
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
you could take a look with me you have
 
03:48:19.080 --> 03:48:19.910 align:start position:0%
you could take a look with me you have
the

03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah uh before you okay so on
 
03:48:26.830 --> 03:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
the first page line uh 26 and I'm I'm
 
03:48:28.110 --> 03:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
just wanting to make sure I'm
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
interpreting there's a strike through on
 
03:48:33.910 --> 03:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
the word event and I wasn't clear if
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
that was referring to like a single
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
function or if this meant like an
 
03:48:41.229 --> 03:48:41.239 align:start position:0%
extreme you know flooding or weather
 
03:48:43.229 --> 03:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
type of event where there would be
 
03:48:44.510 --> 03:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
because it's under imminent health
 
03:48:47.229 --> 03:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
hazard so I was curious to
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
know how
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
that word is interpreted there is that
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
is that around a natural disaster or is
 
03:48:57.870 --> 03:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
it more like
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
a so I we we um would prefer that that
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
term event stay in place because an
 
03:49:08.189 --> 03:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
event in and up itself could create a
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
eminent health hazard you overcrowding
 
03:49:13.070 --> 03:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
and and the restrooms are no longer
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
functional and you have sewage backup an
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
event could contribute to a eminent
 
03:49:17.520 --> 03:49:21.229 align:start position:0%
event could contribute to a eminent
health

03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
hazard represent kulon thank you madam
 
03:49:25.870 --> 03:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:49:28.349 --> 03:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
question I'm curious if you have any
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that connects food born illness
 
03:49:36.030 --> 03:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
with homestead food products in New
 
03:49:37.990 --> 03:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sure thank you for your
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
question so as I mentioned on our uh the
 
03:49:42.830 --> 03:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
previous testimony is sometimes it's
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
very challenging to directly link food
 
03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
items consumed to a respective illness
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
just by the nature of the time period it
 
03:49:53.790 --> 03:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
can take from someone to acquire and eat
 
03:49:55.710 --> 03:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
that food it can take three to five days
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
for some depending on the bacteria that
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
you're looking at um to be ill but it
 
03:50:02.030 --> 03:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
could also be very quick if it's a toxin
 
03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
um so usually people will be sick and
 
03:50:05.149 --> 03:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
then it will take a period of time
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
before they even seek health care so it
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
can be a week or two weeks Rec call bias
 
03:50:12.149 --> 03:50:12.159 align:start position:0%
or being able to remember what you ate
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
at that time is very challenging we do
 
03:50:16.030 --> 03:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
foodborn interviews so if we do get a
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
case that comes in we investigate and we
 
03:50:21.389 --> 03:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
we interview individuals who are ill or
 
03:50:23.110 --> 03:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
a medical proxy so for example if it's a
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
parent of a child um and we do those
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
interviews and we collect a food history
 
03:50:29.149 --> 03:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
depending on what we think the par
 
03:50:31.189 --> 03:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
particular illness may be so we can try
 
03:50:33.790 --> 03:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
to identify or pinpoint that item
 
03:50:35.710 --> 03:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
however if it's been two weeks or a week
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
after their illness it is very hard for
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
us to acquire specimens from from Human
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
specimens so St specimens to be able to
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
then also link that directly to a
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
particular food item typically food
 
03:50:48.030 --> 03:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
items are discarded within a certain
 
03:50:51.070 --> 03:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
period of time that said um we have not
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
identified very many Link Link directly
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
to Homestead foods but I think that's
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
also because most of the items right now
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
that are available that can be SED by
 
03:51:02.149 --> 03:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
Homestead foods are lower risk whereas
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes Homestead foods that
 
03:51:06.510 --> 03:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
may be higher risk as meats and cheeses
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
um and other prepared foods that have
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
higher risk across contain and are
 
03:51:11.790 --> 03:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
directly or more directly linked to
 
03:51:14.469 --> 03:51:14.479 align:start position:0%
outbreaks when we do see them um I hope
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
that answered your question follow up
 
03:51:18.870 --> 03:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
follow up uh that sounds like a no to me
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
am I hearing you correctly no we don't
 
03:51:22.590 --> 03:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
have any over the last two years when we
 
03:51:24.550 --> 03:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
looked compared to Homestead Foods we
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
did not see any directly linked but just
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
because you don't see the data doesn't
 
03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
mean that they're not there we also do
 
03:51:31.550 --> 03:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
know that there's vast Under reporting
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
of anic illness because most people
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
don't seek medical care to be able to
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
really confirm ideology if they have an
 
03:51:41.389 --> 03:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
anic illness thank you and have you uh
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
experienced any foodborn illness reports
 
03:51:46.229 --> 03:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
from soup
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
kitchens I'm trying to think back so
 
03:51:50.309 --> 03:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
into my memory banks of when I started
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
here um and looking back at our outbreak
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
Tracking not particularly that I can
 
03:51:57.070 --> 03:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
think of to souit kitchens we have um at
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
various outbreaks and events reported
 
03:52:02.110 --> 03:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
from restaurant locations several um
 
03:52:05.149 --> 03:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
either events such as like Pig roasts um
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
and community events to also um maybe
 
03:52:10.030 --> 03:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
not really Church but other types of
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
events where people congregate and have
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
brought food in um and then also bring
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
that food the food items home and also
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
share it with their with their family
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
members who may not even also been
 
03:52:21.309 --> 03:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
present there so we have seen kind of
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
secondary Transmission in other outbreak
 
03:52:25.710 --> 03:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
events where people have brought food in
 
03:52:26.990 --> 03:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and then also sometimes secondary
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
transmission from individuals who have
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
an infectious disease and individuals
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
can have personto person contact after
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd have to go look further
 
03:52:37.630 --> 03:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
back though to provide you um specific
 
03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
data to that though okay
 
03:52:41.630 --> 03:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you're next and
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
then represent so um I guess this is
 
03:52:48.510 --> 03:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a followup on that so just uh
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
you you have seen evidence of um things
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
that like church suppers that sort of
 
03:52:57.710 --> 03:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
community event uh how prevalent are
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
those it's a good question um we just
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
completed some uh data request for the
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
past two two years majority of the
 
03:53:07.309 --> 03:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
outbreaks we've seen are personto person
 
03:53:09.790 --> 03:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
typically neuro virus like illness
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
um but we have seen other illnesses like
 
03:53:14.870 --> 03:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
salmonella um and I believe uh two so
 
03:53:16.349 --> 03:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
one was associated with an outbreak and
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think um and other two were associated
 
03:53:21.630 --> 03:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
with um maybe potentially I think raw
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
milk at the time um or exposure to
 
03:53:26.950 --> 03:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
animals as well um we do also track
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
quite a few um National outbreaks as
 
03:53:31.710 --> 03:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
well um related to either produce or
 
03:53:32.950 --> 03:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
other items that have been shipped
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
across state lines represent Bixby
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
followup so
 
03:53:40.910 --> 03:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
um trying to to break that down a little
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
bit more uh it sounds like
 
03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
some uh some fraction of the uh the
 
03:53:53.349 --> 03:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
contagion at those community events has
 
03:53:55.750 --> 03:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
has to do with them being communal
 
03:53:58.149 --> 03:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
events so congreg you know you get a lot
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
of people in the same place and uh some
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
of them may have to do with
 
03:54:06.910 --> 03:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
contamination of the food itself uh that
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
would have may have been result of bad
 
03:54:13.229 --> 03:54:13.239 align:start position:0%
preparation or bad handling uh do you
 
03:54:14.790 --> 03:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
have any sense of what the breakdown of
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
that is I don't in front of me we can
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
look into that we'd have to look back at
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of number of years of data
 
03:54:23.990 --> 03:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
um we do we there are several outbreaks
 
03:54:25.389 --> 03:54:25.399 align:start position:0%
in recent history where it did look like
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
it was cross contamination due to People
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
to People interaction um but we have had
 
03:54:31.910 --> 03:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
um pretty clear instances where there
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
was a contaminated food product due to
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
handling holding temperature issues um
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
and also very pretty rapid illness
 
03:54:41.110 --> 03:54:41.120 align:start position:0%
because of toxin um that people ingested
 
03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
that food later on um I'm thinking of a
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
like a turkey dinner for example where
 
03:54:46.870 --> 03:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
individuals later on ate that and we did
 
03:54:48.630 --> 03:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
have pretty clear evidence that it was
 
03:54:51.910 --> 03:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
due to food practice and food handling
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Marie thank you
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair um thank you for taking my
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
question one of the questions I had was
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
around the Mobile Food units and I was
 
03:55:03.309 --> 03:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
curious to know whether or not are those
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
are those something we currently license
 
03:55:07.229 --> 03:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
and track and uh it's mentioned a few
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
times throughout the bill so I just was
 
03:55:13.510 --> 03:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
curious as far as um how that fits in
 
03:55:16.990 --> 03:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
this conversation so we were a little
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
unclear as to if Mo it does exempt
 
03:55:24.990 --> 03:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
mobile units from a food license we were
 
03:55:26.910 --> 03:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that to be only those that
 
03:55:29.149 --> 03:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
were serving food made in an artisan
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
kitchen and not all mobile food units
 
03:55:34.269 --> 03:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
but that was something we were a little
 
03:55:37.990 --> 03:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
bit unclear with the the wording of the
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.590 --> 03:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah um thank you
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
and um the other question that I had was
 
03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
around products like kombuchas or other
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
types of fermented products that might
 
03:55:54.349 --> 03:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
be there um are those would that be on
 
03:55:59.790 --> 03:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
line I guess line four d uh 28 29 30 is
 
03:56:04.710 --> 03:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
that a up page four on the amendment yes
 
03:56:07.389 --> 03:56:07.399 align:start position:0%
pleas is that considered a high acid
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
food a low acid food just trying to
 
03:56:12.269 --> 03:56:12.279 align:start position:0%
educate myself on where those would sit
 
03:56:16.030 --> 03:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
so so kombucha is a we regulate that as
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
a beverage product it it is it does um
 
03:56:21.199 --> 03:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
a beverage product it it is it does um
require

03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
require
 
03:56:25.790 --> 03:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
some review by an authority because what
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
can happen with kombucha is it be Can it
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
can become alcoholic over time and so
 
03:56:32.590 --> 03:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
the producer would need to make sure
 
03:56:34.870 --> 03:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
that they formulated it in a way that
 
03:56:36.429 --> 03:56:36.439 align:start position:0%
they either marketed it as an alcoholic
 
03:56:38.870 --> 03:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
beverage or that it didn't start as
 
03:56:40.670 --> 03:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic but due to the ongoing
 
03:56:43.269 --> 03:56:43.279 align:start position:0%
fermentation become U an alcoholic
 
03:56:46.189 --> 03:56:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:50.670 --> 03:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
time any other questions represent Bixby
 
03:56:54.070 --> 03:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm trying to figure out um
 
03:56:57.870 --> 03:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
where we go with this comparison of uh
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
being able to produce food for uh
 
03:57:03.630 --> 03:57:03.640 align:start position:0%
something like a church supper or um
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
other other community event like that
 
03:57:11.110 --> 03:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
where uh and and that allow maybe like a
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
um a bake sale or something that's
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
allowed because of its nonprofit
 
03:57:22.510 --> 03:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
nature but um but it seems like in terms
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
of the actual food safety issues there
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
may be fewer food safety issues with
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
someone who's uh uh creating a a
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
relatively small number of meals in
 
03:57:37.950 --> 03:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
their home kitchen and then selling
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
those to Neighbors
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm wondering where where does
 
03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:43.189 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm wondering where where does
that

03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
F am I right in in in thinking that the
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
the producing a few meals for uh for a
 
03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
fee for your neighbors might be a lower
 
03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
risk thing than a church
 
03:57:58.269 --> 03:57:58.279 align:start position:0%
supper you know I I think it's all about
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
the it comes down to the the greater the
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
volume of food you're producing there's
 
03:58:05.389 --> 03:58:05.399 align:start position:0%
a there will likely be higher risk
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
you're either feeding more people you're
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
having to cook larger amounts of food
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
store larger amounts of food so it I
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's hard to parse what
 
03:58:19.349 --> 03:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
whether a few um meals for what what a
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
few meals for your neighbors translate
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
do they equate we're you know because
 
03:58:29.790 --> 03:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Services and temporar
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
events are exempt from our statute it
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that there's not food
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
safety risks associated with those I
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
mean fairs in our Deerfield fair for
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
example there are is no inspection and
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
Licensing of the vendors there it it's
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
exempt from our statute doesn't mean
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
that there's not food safety risks
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
associated associated with it but but
 
03:58:51.309 --> 03:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
it's something that's allowed follow up
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
follow up so uh if we were to uh add
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
something to this bill that would uh
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
limit the total number of meals uh in
 
03:59:04.349 --> 03:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
some way that could be produced under
 
03:59:06.870 --> 03:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
this exemption would that make it uh
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
would you be more comfortable with it
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
I I think we would be open to talking in
 
03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
a in a a study manner on but Li again
 
03:59:20.950 --> 03:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
opening um opening up to the type of
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
food that can be produced it's even even
 
03:59:26.149 --> 03:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
um it's going to introduce more risks in
 
03:59:27.910 --> 03:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
the current situation and again our
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
concern is without any license or
 
03:59:33.790 --> 03:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
registration process for vendors our our
 
03:59:37.149 --> 03:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement is is really will be very
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
very difficult or if at all okay thank
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray I thought you
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
had a question no representative H
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
Haskins oh the hair hand was over there
 
03:59:49.149 --> 03:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
and then you're
 
03:59:51.510 --> 03:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
next oh okay I just had another comment
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
to add to that I think it also depends
 
03:59:55.469 --> 03:59:55.479 align:start position:0%
on the particular food product being
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
produced and being high risk or lower
 
03:59:59.710 --> 03:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
risk and particularly around acidified
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
Foods or uh fermented foods could be
 
04:00:04.750 --> 04:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
very high risk to botulism um which
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
though it's very rare and it's very rare
 
04:00:08.590 --> 04:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
since we've had any cases in New
 
04:00:10.429 --> 04:00:10.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are still around 19 to
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
20 or so cases reported each year and
 
04:00:15.510 --> 04:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
botulism is a very severe disease it
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
requires incredible fast medical and
 
04:00:19.790 --> 04:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
public health response to the point to
 
04:00:21.710 --> 04:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
treat someone with suspected
 
04:00:24.030 --> 04:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
botulism we do get suspected cases
 
04:00:25.950 --> 04:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
reported in we have to immediately
 
04:00:27.269 --> 04:00:27.279 align:start position:0%
coordinate that response with the
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control for
 
04:00:30.950 --> 04:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
antitoxin so if you have even just a
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
handful of people that then had a a a
 
04:00:35.550 --> 04:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
canned product that could be risky for
 
04:00:37.349 --> 04:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
botulism we'd have to coordinate that
 
04:00:39.189 --> 04:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
response pretty rapidly so I just I
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
think it depends on also the illness and
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
then the food that could be
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
prepared representative H Haskins thank
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um Miss Hansen I one of
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
the things I'm struggling with um
 
04:00:54.670 --> 04:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
because I think this is a very serious
 
04:00:58.229 --> 04:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
topic and I'm trying to educate myself
 
04:01:02.590 --> 04:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
but the data that we have is all that we
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
know of and I'm thinking about the
 
04:01:10.550 --> 04:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
scientific statement that absence of
 
04:01:14.990 --> 04:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
evidence is not evidence of absence so
 
04:01:18.510 --> 04:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that it's your concern that
 
04:01:22.110 --> 04:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
we would have more cases and more data
 
04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
if we remove some of the restrictions
 
04:01:27.510 --> 04:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
that are currently in place is that true
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct I think you said it
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
better than I did so thank you
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
bman thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:01:41.469 --> 04:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
for for taking my question I think to to
 
04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
kind of piggyback on that question is
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
although we don't have specific evidence
 
04:01:49.389 --> 04:01:49.399 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons you stated are is
 
04:01:51.149 --> 04:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
there any way for the Department to make
 
04:01:54.910 --> 04:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
a an educated guess can you speculate
 
04:01:56.670 --> 04:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
which of course isn't evidence but I
 
04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if if that's something that
 
04:02:00.750 --> 04:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
you have and if there's anything that
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
you do with that information right
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
now sure so I don't have all of the data
 
04:02:06.990 --> 04:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
in front of me so I couldn't bring it to
 
04:02:08.590 --> 04:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
this table right now but we'd be happy
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
to look back at all of our data I do
 
04:02:11.950 --> 04:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
actually I can leave this later it's our
 
04:02:13.710 --> 04:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
monthly communicable disease report it's
 
04:02:15.149 --> 04:02:15.159 align:start position:0%
only by counts by year so it's not
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
getting to the Nuance level that you
 
04:02:19.950 --> 04:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
want but we can pull um data based on
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
the type of pathogen um so whether it's
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
estc or eoli or salmonela and uh
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
potential risk that may have led to that
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
illness um but it is important to
 
04:02:31.510 --> 04:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
mention that individuals may have
 
04:02:33.630 --> 04:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
multiple exposures so just because one
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
person had an exposure to a food they
 
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
may have also been exposed to their pet
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
or even a pet pet food product so it's
 
04:02:42.910 --> 04:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
it is hard to really pinpoint exactly um
 
04:02:44.590 --> 04:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
we're more likely to get that if there
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
is an outbreak or a national outbreak
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
where there's more data that can really
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
substantiate those claims and then also
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
be able to link um laboratory evidence
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
but we can look back at that and we'd be
 
04:02:55.349 --> 04:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
happy to do that for you it will take a
 
04:02:56.910 --> 04:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of time but we have um
 
04:02:59.229 --> 04:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
epidemiology staff on hand that could do
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
that representative Murray um I just
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to if I heard you correctly in
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
your in your just your most recent
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
testimony when you're talking about
 
04:03:10.469 --> 04:03:10.479 align:start position:0%
potentially pet transmitted are you
 
04:03:12.429 --> 04:03:12.439 align:start position:0%
talking about potentially like raw Pet
 
04:03:14.429 --> 04:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
Foods or things that contain like meat
 
04:03:17.149 --> 04:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
or fish that are raw so a lot of these
 
04:03:19.950 --> 04:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
anic pathogens are also zuno in nature
 
04:03:22.149 --> 04:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
so a lot of our illnesses that we have
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
and and infectious diseases are often
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
zuntic where um not only ourselves as
 
04:03:27.870 --> 04:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
humans can we get infected but also our
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
animals can or vice versa if we are pet
 
04:03:32.189 --> 04:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
there's been actually pet food um
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
implicated outbreaks um and recalls with
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
pet food as well um so if an individual
 
04:03:39.870 --> 04:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
get salmonella for example we'll do a
 
04:03:41.550 --> 04:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
food history interview but we also ask
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
about pet exposures so that's just one
 
04:03:45.630 --> 04:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
thing that we we look to as a potential
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
reason where someone may have become
 
04:03:53.469 --> 04:03:53.479 align:start position:0%
ill so I'm again interested to know if
 
04:03:57.030 --> 04:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
the department knows um for some of
 
04:03:59.790 --> 04:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
these other states that have lifted some
 
04:04:01.710 --> 04:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
of the restrictions on the foods that
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
have been produced and sold by Artisans
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
or Homestead people Farm
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
whatever if you have seen an uptick in
 
04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
uh people getting sick or poisoned or
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
ingesting botulism or whatever have you
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
as a department seen any of that
 
04:04:24.630 --> 04:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
evidence in other states that have
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
laws you know certainly we can query
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
those specific States I did see some
 
04:04:38.110 --> 04:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
data from Wyoming um once they passed
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
their food freedom is in particular it
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
was Ill illnesses associated with with
 
04:04:46.070 --> 04:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
raw milk consumption that their cases
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
definitely had a spike after their food
 
04:04:53.229 --> 04:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
Freedom law was was enacted um as to the
 
04:04:55.149 --> 04:04:55.159 align:start position:0%
other states that have been mentioned in
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
this testimony we could specifically
 
04:04:59.309 --> 04:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
query those but I do know that some of
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
them um are very recent so there might
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
not be a lot of data a
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
available and I'll add to that I also
 
04:05:08.349 --> 04:05:08.359 align:start position:0%
just briefly looked at Wyoming and they
 
04:05:09.990 --> 04:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
they've seen an increase and I believe
 
04:05:11.670 --> 04:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
it was salmonella and estc but I'd have
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
to look back again um over the past two
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
years um 2020 to 21 but again that data
 
04:05:20.070 --> 04:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
is not all the way up to date so I think
 
04:05:22.030 --> 04:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look back to see um and
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
then particular reasons for that but it
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
does look like they've also seen an
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
increase of some of anic
 
04:05:29.710 --> 04:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
pathogens thank
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
04:05:33.550 --> 04:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:05:38.710 --> 04:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
um I have two um some of the data that
 
04:05:43.990 --> 04:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
you've been citing with salmon ill
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and botulism outbreaks are
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
those specific to New Hampshire or were
 
04:05:51.550 --> 04:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
they National numbers sure thank you so
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
most of the ones I've rep spoken about
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
are for New Hampshire um for but I
 
04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned 19 or so cases I think that
 
04:06:00.590 --> 04:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
was 2018 or 19 that's reported National
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
numbers so that's the 19 is National um
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I don't believe we' seen
 
04:06:07.389 --> 04:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen a botulism case um
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
related to food uh for over 15 years we
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
have had a couple infant botulism cases
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
over the past um one I think one was in
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
2021 okay thank you second question
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
again um and you mentioned that there
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
were some people that you had to go out
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
and speak to um regarding food boor and
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
illnesses do you see re once you talk to
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
those folks uh do you see a repeat in
 
04:06:36.590 --> 04:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
their behavior or is it usually from
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question typically
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's new individuals um so it may
 
04:06:45.630 --> 04:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
not be from their own food prep or their
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
own behavior um we do so as a just for
 
04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
awareness for the committee how we
 
04:06:52.590 --> 04:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations if there is a
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
complaint that comes in we will follow
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
up on that with our colleagues at Food
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
protection or we will get laboratory
 
04:07:00.910 --> 04:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
reports from Health Care Providers
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
suspecting an an anic or waterborne or
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
other pathogen that's under our statute
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c we receive that we do conduct
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
interviews of those individuals or a
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
medical proxy of all their risk history
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
and the foodborn questionnaires are
 
04:07:17.070 --> 04:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly lengthy they're about four to
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
five pages long and it take could take
 
04:07:20.950 --> 04:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
about half an hour to an hour to go
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
through those does the department uh
 
04:07:28.990 --> 04:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS do they provide any kind of classes
 
04:07:34.149 --> 04:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
or or online education for people uh who
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
are seeking to produce food so we we do
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
have a food safety 101 it's a 20 minute
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
video available on our website and we
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
also work very closely with UNH
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension they have several
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
um what they call Safe they're free
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
classes that they can attend online for
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
not only Farmers Market vendors um those
 
04:08:00.269 --> 04:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
that work in food pantries or soup
 
04:08:02.269 --> 04:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
kitchen environments or those that are
 
04:08:04.149 --> 04:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
producing food they also have those
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities available
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
through through
 
04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
ention okay so
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
um would it be a good idea to require
 
04:08:19.030 --> 04:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
people who want to produce any kind of
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
artisan Foods or Homestead Foods uh
 
04:08:26.510 --> 04:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
rather than require any kind of lure to
 
04:08:28.750 --> 04:08:28.760 align:start position:0%
require them to have a food
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
safety class of some
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
sort so I think that would be a great
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
idea I I think the the problematic part
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
of it would be how do we enforce that
 
04:08:41.070 --> 04:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
and and keep track that somebody has
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually done taken that class and then
 
04:08:45.630 --> 04:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
what happens if they still continue to
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
produce food and they and they don't
 
04:08:50.109 --> 04:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
haven't taken the class it it I think
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's it the idea has great Merit but it
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
would be very to put it other than an
 
04:08:58.269 --> 04:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
honor System that someone's doing it and
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
tasking enforcement without some kind of
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
lure or registration process it would be
 
04:09:05.149 --> 04:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
really difficult for us to Monitor and
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
know that that's actually taking place
 
04:09:11.790 --> 04:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Bixby so
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
um a possible parallel might be the
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
mushroom foraging
 
04:09:19.229 --> 04:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
program uh which I think is now up and
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
running uh or the um or or the meet the
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
chicken and the poultry and rabbit
 
04:09:29.070 --> 04:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
program which um also provides a level
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
of certification but uh does not have a
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
whole lot of Department hand eyes
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
on so so the
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
the um mushroom forging they that
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
program they do have a a license that's
 
04:09:45.510 --> 04:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
required so we would it's a five-year
 
04:09:48.030 --> 04:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
license so that we do have a licensing
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
provision and then we do have an
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
educational provider through University
 
04:09:54.910 --> 04:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire who's agreeing to to do
 
04:09:57.149 --> 04:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
the um educational piece but there is a
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
licensing component with that um the
 
04:10:02.189 --> 04:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
poultry and rabbits they poultry and
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
rabbit producers are required to
 
04:10:05.469 --> 04:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
register with the Department of
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
Agriculture if they choose to sell to
 
04:10:08.600 --> 04:10:10.070 align:start position:0%
Agriculture if they choose to sell to
licensed

04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants thank you sure okay any
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
other questions from committee members
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for uh
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
helping us out with with uh your
 
04:10:24.670 --> 04:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
testimony today again I would call Keen
 
04:10:24.680 --> 04:10:25.790 align:start position:0%
testimony today again I would call Keen
mang

04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
mang
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
Dr

04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:41.710 --> 04:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Keen May
 
04:10:44.830 --> 04:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
Wong tax policy council with the New
 
04:10:47.149 --> 04:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Revenue um the
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
department does not have a position on
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
this bill however just wanted to
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
highlight a potential concern on the
 
04:10:57.630 --> 04:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
language on the licensing uh similar to
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
the uh the language that was that I
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
highlighted in 15 HB 1565 uh HB 1685
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
also has a similar um
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
language regarding the exemptions of
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
Licensing is uh I do not have the uh the
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
amend the amended bill I only have the S
 
04:11:21.429 --> 04:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
introduced bill is on page four lines 23
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
through 24 uh this is in regards to
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
Artisan food operations and it says that
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
they are exempt from all licensing uh
 
04:11:32.830 --> 04:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
laws in this state um so in that sense
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
this would also uh be exempting these
 
04:11:42.510 --> 04:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
license any questions from the
 
04:11:48.109 --> 04:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
committee thank you we we are uh we'll
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
take that under advisement as we uh look
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
at possible future amendments to this
 
04:11:56.469 --> 04:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you but um we certainly
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to begrudge Dr from uh
 
04:12:05.590 --> 04:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you call Megan Forbes
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:34.590 --> 04:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
ahead there you go you thank you uh
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:12:38.309 --> 04:12:38.319 align:start position:0%
again for the opportunity to testify in
 
04:12:40.349 --> 04:12:40.359 align:start position:0%
support of this bill I'm not going to
 
04:12:43.030 --> 04:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
repeat the points that I made earlier
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
but I just want to say again that we
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
support this bill as a way to safely
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
create Economic Opportunity and expand
 
04:12:53.229 --> 04:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
economic Liberty for homebased food
 
04:12:55.389 --> 04:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
producers um I just wanted to stress
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
again that seven states have enacted
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
similar laws that allow for the sale of
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
perishable food and some have been
 
04:13:06.269 --> 04:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
around for several years now wyomings
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
being the oldest that's been around now
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
for nine years so um in terms of food
 
04:13:14.389 --> 04:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
safety issues if there were a serious
 
04:13:16.109 --> 04:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
food safety issue you would think that
 
04:13:18.510 --> 04:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
we would see some food sa safety issues
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
at this point um and we we haveen it we
 
04:13:23.309 --> 04:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
we've talked with the health departments
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
in those States and we haven't seen them
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
yet related to food that's sold from a
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
home kitchen um I I'm happy to answer
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
any questions that the committee may
 
04:13:37.830 --> 04:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
have yeah do you know if any of the
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
other states that have enacted these
 
04:13:43.269 --> 04:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh pieces of legislation
 
04:13:47.349 --> 04:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
require um Artisan food makers to take
 
04:13:49.830 --> 04:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
any kind of food safety courses or
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
classes Madame chair yes um every state
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
is different a couple of states have
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
required servesafe food handler training
 
04:14:01.590 --> 04:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
for selling food that requires
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
refrigeration or potentially hazardous
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
food um food requiring time or
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
temperature control control for safety
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
one example is Oklahoma Oklahoma's law
 
04:14:12.990 --> 04:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
has been around for a few years now and
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
in Oklahoma if you're selling shelf
 
04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
stable food you do not have to complete
 
04:14:19.750 --> 04:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
the Serve Safe training but if you're
 
04:14:22.590 --> 04:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
selling potentially hazardous food you
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
do um and notably Oklahoma doesn't have
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
a license requirement but to qualify for
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
the exemption to sell potentially
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
hazardous food you have to um complete
 
04:14:39.189 --> 04:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
training okay that's interesting
 
04:14:41.399 --> 04:14:42.510 align:start position:0%
training okay that's interesting
representative

04:14:42.510 --> 04:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
kulong thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh could you
 
04:14:49.229 --> 04:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
maybe speak a little bit about um
 
04:14:51.469 --> 04:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
economies of scale because we do seem to
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
be conflating the distribution footprint
 
04:14:58.349 --> 04:14:58.359 align:start position:0%
of like a kitchen based business and an
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
industrial size retail uh
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
operation representative kulan yes I'm
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about that um as I
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned ear
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
these are small based um producers we
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
often see producers preparing a few
 
04:15:17.189 --> 04:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
meals um they're selling a limited
 
04:15:20.189 --> 04:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
amount of food it's it's very very
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to sell a lot of food from a
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
home kitchen the home kitchen is
 
04:15:27.070 --> 04:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
naturally limiting in its own way um and
 
04:15:29.309 --> 04:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
as we heard before from the Department
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's really the the larger scale of food
 
04:15:32.910 --> 04:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
where you start to see more
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities for food born illness come
 
04:15:37.790 --> 04:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
in so I think that um plays to why this
 
04:15:40.109 --> 04:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
is so
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
safe representative Bixby so do any of
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
the states that uh currently have uh the
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh the more open restrict uh laws on
 
04:15:54.670 --> 04:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
this uh have any sort of restriction in
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the total number of meals sold
 
04:15:58.910 --> 04:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
per week or anything like
 
04:16:02.189 --> 04:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
that representative yes um some states
 
04:16:05.309 --> 04:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
do and some don't most don't um but
 
04:16:07.309 --> 04:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
occasionally we'll see gross sales cap
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire recently repealed um
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
for I'll give you an example Iowa does
 
04:16:17.870 --> 04:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
not cap shelf stable food but if you
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
sell food that's potentially hazardous
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's a $50,000 gross sales cap to
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
limit the food that's potentially
 
04:16:30.030 --> 04:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
hazardous um Wyoming though has no sales
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
cap um I I don't think North Dakota has
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
a sales cap um so it really depends on
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
the state and and what we've seen in
 
04:16:41.710 --> 04:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
reality is that sales caps of
 
04:16:45.710 --> 04:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
$75,000 $100,000 don't really limit
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
homebased food producers because they're
 
04:16:49.990 --> 04:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
not making that much to begin with so
 
04:16:54.389 --> 04:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
cap anyone
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
else no other questions um thank you
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
very much I wonder if you might provide
 
04:17:03.720 --> 04:17:04.469 align:start position:0%
very much I wonder if you might provide
the

04:17:04.469 --> 04:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee um with some information
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
information of just
 
04:17:14.469 --> 04:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
brief um features of each of the states
 
04:17:16.590 --> 04:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
that have introduced these kinds of
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
bills um as you know for instance um
 
04:17:25.229 --> 04:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
those that do have a a a cap on um
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous foods uh those who
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
require food safety training um that
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I'd be interested to see
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
how each of those States of
 
04:17:39.510 --> 04:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
um measured up on that do you have any
 
04:17:42.910 --> 04:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
kind of uh uh data available on that yes
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
sure we'd be happy to compile that
 
04:17:46.349 --> 04:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
information for you we do have all that
 
04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
data and we could get it to you very
 
04:17:51.790 --> 04:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:55.469 --> 04:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no other questions from
 
04:17:57.670 --> 04:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
the committee I would like to have the
 
04:17:57.680 --> 04:18:00.429 align:start position:0%
the committee I would like to have the
blue

04:18:00.429 --> 04:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:04.990 --> 04:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
sheet and um on the
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
online sorry oh uh for the online um
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
testimony submissions we had 19 people
 
04:18:19.389 --> 04:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
opposed and on the blue sheet we had one
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
person in
 
04:18:29.309 --> 04:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
favor with that I'm going to close out
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
1685 and I can give the committee uh
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes if you want
 
04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
to go stretch your legs or something and
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
then we can begin our um our full
 
04:18:47.229 --> 04:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
committee work session anybody want a
 
04:18:49.710 --> 04:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
few minutes just
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.510 --> 04:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
um that are different that
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
okay so I don't know if that count just
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
they went somewhere else let you know
 
04:19:12.800 --> 04:19:35.630 align:start position:0%
they went somewhere else let you know
yeah

04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:32:27.269 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:32:27.269 --> 04:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:30.990 --> 04:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
and I want to go in order with them and
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
maybe if we spend about 20 minutes on
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
each or if we know uh
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
around that ballpark so that we are not
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
here until 7
 
04:32:40.199 --> 04:32:42.229 align:start position:0%
here until 7
o'clock

04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
um uh I think the building closes at
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
um why don't we start with HP
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
1293 and I believe um so relative to
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the use of certain
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
fertilizers using phosphorus I believe
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you've been working
 
04:33:03.630 --> 04:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
with a number of different parties from
 
04:33:06.269 --> 04:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Agriculture
 
04:33:11.150 --> 04:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
Dees um Farm Bureau too um I think yes
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
and uh so what have you got what are you
 
04:33:15.670 --> 04:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
working on and uh what are what are some
 
04:33:17.189 --> 04:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
of the things that need to be fixed with
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill okay so uh the uh one of the
 
04:33:23.551 --> 04:33:23.561 align:start position:0%
questions that came up during our
 
04:33:26.709 --> 04:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
hearing was uh are there things in this
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
bill that would affect uh anything other
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
than Lawns and Turf and the uh
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
the short answer to well the the answer
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
to that is as written there may be
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
however as intended there should not be
 
04:33:49.709 --> 04:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
so uh so the bill was intended to be
 
04:33:54.750 --> 04:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
really focused on runoff from Lawns uh
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh that's one thing that needs
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with uh in the amendment uh
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
so uh what I
 
04:34:08.670 --> 04:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
what I did looking into the bill was I
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
uh talked to Alan Wyman at the
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
department uh of Agriculture and markets
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
and food uh because this is his uh
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
territory to work with and uh we came to
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
a few sticking points in terms of what
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bill was trying to do uh but uh and
 
04:34:33.269 --> 04:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
then I um but we did talk about some of
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
the issues with the uh way that the
 
04:34:38.670 --> 04:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
definitions were set up and that needs
 
04:34:45.990 --> 04:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be um changed a bit and uh the so uh
 
04:34:49.269 --> 04:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
director Ryman directed me to Ted deers
 
04:34:51.310 --> 04:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
who is here from Dees today thank you
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
for coming in uh and uh Ted gave me a
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
lot of good information about um what
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill as written were
 
04:35:02.750 --> 04:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
effective what were problematic what
 
04:35:06.510 --> 04:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
should be changed uh in order to really
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
get the focus uh entirely on uh
 
04:35:13.709 --> 04:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
preventing runoff from Lawns and uh I
 
04:35:17.789 --> 04:35:17.799 align:start position:0%
also spoke with um Courtney eshbach at
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
OS and uh pointed out some of the
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
problems that I was having in terms of
 
04:35:24.990 --> 04:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how the bill was
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
put together and uh one of the things
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
she pointed out was that there are too
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
many definitions in the bill they we
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
don't need most of them because they're
 
04:35:37.629 --> 04:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
re re iterated in the text uh there
 
04:35:40.789 --> 04:35:40.799 align:start position:0%
needs that any definitions need to go
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
into a previous section of the of the um
 
04:35:49.470 --> 04:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
of the chapter of law not not in um
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
section four uh one
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
431 uh 4B which is where most of the
 
04:35:58.869 --> 04:35:58.879 align:start position:0%
bill is currently targeted and
 
04:36:03.551 --> 04:36:03.561 align:start position:0%
the uh for Just for information 4314 a
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
and 4B uh are were were put in back in
 
04:36:12.470 --> 04:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
2013 specifically for protecting water
 
04:36:14.910 --> 04:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
water quality
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
and uh they deal with n but a deals with
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
nitrogen B de B deals with phosphorus uh
 
04:36:24.750 --> 04:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
they're both really about what gets put
 
04:36:24.760 --> 04:36:25.470 align:start position:0%
they're both really about what gets put
on

04:36:25.470 --> 04:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
lawns uh except uh the way that they
 
04:36:31.510 --> 04:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
were written has to do with what was
 
04:36:36.189 --> 04:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
what is sold and one one big change with
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is how it's used and uh so uh
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
the existing law puts the onus entirely
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
on the retailers in ter and the uh
 
04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in terms of uh selling
 
04:36:55.830 --> 04:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
what they can sell for what purpose uh
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
this bill changes that so that it says
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
the uh owner or maintainer of a lawn
 
04:37:08.109 --> 04:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
needs to follow a particular set of U
 
04:37:11.189 --> 04:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
practices in order to avoid putting too
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
much nutrients on their lawn and having
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
them run off uh
 
04:37:20.590 --> 04:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
so uh one of the key aspects of of that
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
is that there is absolutely no way that
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
anyone in in state government is going
 
04:37:29.949 --> 04:37:29.959 align:start position:0%
to be able to enforce what any one uh
 
04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
homeowner or lawn maintenance person is
 
04:37:37.310 --> 04:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
doing with which B bags of fertilizer uh
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
it is so the key the key part of this
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill is really the education piece and
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
there is that education piece that has a
 
04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
bit of text that needs to be posted near
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
the fertilizer section I think that the
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
actual text shouldn't appear in the bill
 
04:37:57.551 --> 04:37:57.561 align:start position:0%
I think that it that parameters for the
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
text should and then the actual text
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
should be done by department rulemaking
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
so that it's a little bit more Flex ible
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
if they realize oh this isn't quite as
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
effective as we thought it was then they
 
04:38:12.269 --> 04:38:12.279 align:start position:0%
can tweak it um and then that
 
04:38:14.429 --> 04:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
educational material would be posted in
 
04:38:16.470 --> 04:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
retail locations where fertilizers are
 
04:38:20.510 --> 04:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
sold so that people will be educated
 
04:38:22.869 --> 04:38:22.879 align:start position:0%
about how you know which fertilizer they
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
should use on their lawn and um how to
 
04:38:30.429 --> 04:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
avoid putting on too much uh so uh I
 
04:38:32.709 --> 04:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
think that that education part is really
 
04:38:36.670 --> 04:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
critical um so I'm going to be working
 
04:38:36.680 --> 04:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
critical um so I'm going to be working
with

04:38:37.990 --> 04:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:38:42.029 --> 04:38:42.039 align:start position:0%
um uh working with uh Mr deers and Mr
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
Wyman and uh also Eric satel who is here
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
from the Farm Bureau uh to uh and uh and
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
OSS to come up with an amendment that
 
04:38:56.109 --> 04:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
moves things into the right part parts
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
of of the chapter uh excludes the parts
 
04:39:01.789 --> 04:39:01.799 align:start position:0%
of the bill that are not really
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
effective and really focus it is focus
 
04:39:08.590 --> 04:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
it Focus the bill on uh what the
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
definitions of what you can put your put
 
04:39:14.429 --> 04:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
on your lawn are and uh how we can get
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
that information out to the public thank
 
04:39:20.189 --> 04:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby and I I do
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the email that I received
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
from um Mr sautel had a lot of really
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
good um edits in in this uh
 
04:39:33.189 --> 04:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
document uh and I hope that you'll
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
you'll consider those uh in your
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment and also I mean I was not a
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
real fan of making our um retail
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
establishments separate u bags of
 
04:39:49.750 --> 04:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and put one in one place and
 
04:39:51.868 --> 04:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
one in another I I think that that's
 
04:39:52.750 --> 04:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
burdensome thing I you know especially
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
if they don't have the space to do these
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of activities uh and and I hope
 
04:40:02.990 --> 04:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
that um that that kind of thing is not
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
going to be included right so we can we
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
can avoid the separate locations part of
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
it the most important thing is having
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
the signage there saying this is what
 
04:40:16.030 --> 04:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
you should be putting on your lawn this
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
is what you shouldn't be putting on your
 
04:40:20.708 --> 04:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
lawn okay representative
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for really doing a
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
lot of uh leg work on this um my thought
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
is that we should put in there uh
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
depending on how you're drafting this
 
04:40:37.948 --> 04:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
that agriculture as defined by RSA
 
04:40:41.310 --> 04:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
234a should be exempt from anything in
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
because we are already guided on how we
 
04:40:48.510 --> 04:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
can apply fertilizer when we can do it
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
Etc and all our setbacks and I don't
 
04:40:54.190 --> 04:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
think that the agricultural Community
 
04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
should have to be looking to another
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
area for their laws that actually was
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
included in U Mr satel's edits yeah so
 
04:41:05.230 --> 04:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
he referenced that so the
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
the only so um by putting it into
 
04:41:14.430 --> 04:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
431 uh 4B 4 a and 4B and making sure
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
that the language in those two sections
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
is really specific to Lawns that will
 
04:41:22.350 --> 04:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
avoid the the bleed over into
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh the one place where there
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
is where there may be some uh ambiguity
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
uh is uh for golf courses and for sod
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
farms and for both of those uh I would
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
be putting I'll be putting in something
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
that says that those operations need to
 
04:41:43.868 --> 04:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
have a nutrient management plan and if
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have a nutrient management plan
 
04:41:50.190 --> 04:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
then they are exempt from the ex from
 
04:41:52.990 --> 04:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
the conditions otherwise uh there was
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
also some question about um Frozen
 
04:41:59.910 --> 04:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
Ground uh and um Mr sautel pointed out
 
04:42:04.030 --> 04:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
very appropriately that uh four five to
 
04:42:05.990 --> 04:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
six inches of frozen ground probably
 
04:42:09.150 --> 04:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
isn't actually the right measurement uh
 
04:42:12.310 --> 04:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
if the ground is frozen to 1 inch that's
 
04:42:14.550 --> 04:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
you get just as much runoff as if it's
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
frozen to 5 in so it's a matter of if
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's less than one inch you might have
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
some fluctuation during the day uh so
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
late in the season if it's you if you
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
have half an inch frozen in the morning
 
04:42:31.150 --> 04:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
and then it's um and then it warms up
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
during the day it might not be uh a
 
04:42:36.750 --> 04:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
problematic to spread fertilizer if
 
04:42:39.628 --> 04:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about say mid April uh and
 
04:42:42.390 --> 04:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
you already have grass starting uh but
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
the most important thing is that you
 
04:42:47.310 --> 04:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
don't put nutrients down when there's no
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
when there are no plants to take them up
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's something that uh
 
04:42:55.830 --> 04:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
a principle that that I'll also be
 
04:42:58.270 --> 04:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
paying attention in terms of U putting
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
this together so is your intention to
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
also strike out uh the dates or months
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned in the in the bill
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh I think I'm going to consult with uh
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
Mr deers and Mr satel uh about uh
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
whether the appropriateness of those
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
dates because I think that there that
 
04:43:24.030 --> 04:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
some some dates might it might be
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have some dates uh and uh
 
04:43:30.030 --> 04:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure I'm getting the
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
right one so I'm going to talk to talk
 
04:43:35.590 --> 04:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
to people who are familiar with this
 
04:43:38.230 --> 04:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative kraton thank you
 
04:43:41.350 --> 04:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh representative Bixby I I
 
04:43:42.788 --> 04:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
agree with the direction you're you're
 
04:43:45.310 --> 04:43:45.320 align:start position:0%
taking this thing uh one question I have
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
is the signage is that a consum or is
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
that a retail owner responsibility to
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
purchase does the state provide those
 
04:43:56.910 --> 04:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
and how are they paid for what are your
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that so uh what I I I took a
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
look at a couple of other states and
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
Maryland has some very nice signs that
 
04:44:09.390 --> 04:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
they have available as PDFs on their
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
website that can be printed at different
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
sizes and uh I think that might be uh
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
the way to go because uh I I think that
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
printing out uh a few sheets of eight
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
and a half by 11 is not a huge financial
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
burden uh as long as the design is
 
04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't require any particular work so
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
the department would make the signs and
 
04:44:36.750 --> 04:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
and then they could be printed out by
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
retailers Roger thank you okay
 
04:44:43.270 --> 04:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh yes thank you um
 
04:44:44.750 --> 04:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
I agree with the direction that you're
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
taking and I think this is a good first
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
step but interestingly enough there was
 
04:44:50.910 --> 04:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
an article in the Boston Globe this
 
04:44:54.190 --> 04:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
morning that says EPA study finds almost
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
no progress in River stream pollution
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
and there's a statement that says for
 
04:45:01.070 --> 04:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
decades federal and state officials have
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
struggled to control Farm runoff the
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
biggest source of nutrient pollution
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is not typically federally
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
regulated and I'm thinking this isn't
 
04:45:11.708 --> 04:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill for it but I think
 
04:45:14.910 --> 04:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
sometime down the road we might want to
 
04:45:17.550 --> 04:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
start at least uh maybe doing a study
 
04:45:20.190 --> 04:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
committee or looking into
 
04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
that yes so I actually happen to have
 
04:45:26.230 --> 04:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
read that article as well and it was
 
04:45:29.070 --> 04:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
really focused largely on Midwestern
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
states and uh I think that uh the one
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
thing that uh UNH has been doing a lot
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
of work on is studying uh nutrient
 
04:45:45.628 --> 04:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
Management in um agricultural lands in
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and uh and
 
04:45:52.830 --> 04:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
doing a certain amount of monitoring and
 
04:45:57.150 --> 04:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
looking at patterns uh and I think that
 
04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
we can reach out to UNH to find out uh
 
04:46:03.788 --> 04:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
if there are generalized practices in
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
the state that need to to be modified in
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
order to account for that or if we're
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually doing fairly well on that on
 
04:46:14.750 --> 04:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
the agricultural end so I think that
 
04:46:17.070 --> 04:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
this is one thing where State specific
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
information is really
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
critical representative Murray um thanks
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question this is actually
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
for Mr sautel if that's am I able to do
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
that sure I invite Mr sautel up to
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
the to the
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
microphone if you may take a question or
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
two and I want to thank you so much for
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
your uh your document that you sent
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
along with edits to uh to this bill they
 
04:46:45.440 --> 04:46:46.430 align:start position:0%
along with edits to uh to this bill they
were

04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
helpful representative Murray thank you
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair so my question for you was
 
04:46:53.708 --> 04:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
around um the I think it was around the
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
percentage available of phosphate and
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that there might have
 
04:47:00.070 --> 04:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
been some contradicting language around
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
it uh yes and and well two things first
 
04:47:07.548 --> 04:47:07.558 align:start position:0%
that level is no longer that 67% is no
 
04:47:09.990 --> 04:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
longer the level that probably we should
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
use if we're going to change the RSA
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
should be 0.
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
five and uh the section that you're
 
04:47:18.280 --> 04:47:18.290 align:start position:0%
talking about I think
 
04:47:18.290 --> 04:47:20.830 align:start position:0%
talking about I think
[Music]

04:47:20.830 --> 04:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:47:23.310 --> 04:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
is let me check
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
here in one place in in the existing
 
04:47:30.548 --> 04:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
document in one
 
04:47:34.830 --> 04:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
F you say uh phospherous contact tent or
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
phosphate or for phosphoric acid
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
whichever you use and I would say that
 
04:47:42.510 --> 04:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
the same ter terminology should be used
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
throughout the document this as if I
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
recall from what representative Bell
 
04:47:50.110 --> 04:47:50.120 align:start position:0%
said uh this was a conglomeration of a
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
number of different sources and they all
 
04:47:55.470 --> 04:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
use different uh terminology so if you
 
04:47:57.590 --> 04:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
just say available phosphorus which is
 
04:48:02.110 --> 04:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
the title U word used throughout the
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
document I think it would be less
 
04:48:06.430 --> 04:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
confusing to consumers but in one F in
 
04:48:08.548 --> 04:48:08.558 align:start position:0%
the definition of phosphorous
 
04:48:12.750 --> 04:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
fertilizer as written it says content uh
 
04:48:14.548 --> 04:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
is greater
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
than and then
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
in um I
 
04:48:23.190 --> 04:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
think farther down in the
 
04:48:32.670 --> 04:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
it um
 
04:48:38.910 --> 04:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
it also is in it's in 1f and Roman two
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
so Roman two
 
04:48:45.628 --> 04:48:45.638 align:start position:0%
says cannot be greater than so which is
 
04:48:48.270 --> 04:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
it uh which do you want it to be you've
 
04:48:49.350 --> 04:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
got a
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
different different terminology in there
 
04:48:53.788 --> 04:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
and I think just the wording uh the word
 
04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:01.310 --> 04:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
out does that answer your question yeah
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
so I can I can just give a little bit
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
more clarification in terms of what
 
04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
process I'm going to use for that uh
 
04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
there's an organization called I it's
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
a CO or some some combination of those
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
letters uh that is it's an organization
 
04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
of uh industry groups and uh academic
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
groups that uh figure out what
 
04:49:27.750 --> 04:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
definitions make sense
 
04:49:31.070 --> 04:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
for uh fertilizer and soil amendments
 
04:49:34.628 --> 04:49:34.638 align:start position:0%
and soil conditions Etc uh first for
 
04:49:36.830 --> 04:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
laws in in States in order to get
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
basically get states to have very
 
04:49:42.750 --> 04:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
similar definitions on in their laws so
 
04:49:44.510 --> 04:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
they have they have a specific
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
definition for uh no phosphate
 
04:49:48.910 --> 04:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and I'm going to be working
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
with director Ryman who has access to
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
their uh proprietary list of definitions
 
04:49:58.110 --> 04:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
to um come up with to get as many of the
 
04:50:00.430 --> 04:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
sort of nationally approved definitions
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
as possible for uh for the amendment
 
04:50:06.350 --> 04:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
could I add one thing Madam chair sure
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh in in that
 
04:50:11.670 --> 04:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
definition uh I think it would be who us
 
04:50:15.150 --> 04:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
to put in the RSA particularly that what
 
04:50:18.310 --> 04:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
you are talking about is a level of uh
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
expressed as p205 which is a chemical
 
04:50:23.230 --> 04:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
formula that doesn't appear in anywhere
 
04:50:26.310 --> 04:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the uh current legislation
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
it just says available phosphorus and
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
and if this is going to be an
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
educational piece I think that should be
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
included in this so everybody's is on
 
04:50:36.430 --> 04:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
the same page some places use the word
 
04:50:38.708 --> 04:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
phosphorus some places use phosphate
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
some PL places use phosphoric acid but
 
04:50:44.788 --> 04:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
if it's expressed as p205 which is the
 
04:50:47.430 --> 04:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
analysis it's not what's in the soil
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's the analysis uh that that chemical
 
04:50:54.868 --> 04:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh formula does not occur in the soil
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
but uh that's what's in the
 
04:50:57.000 --> 04:50:58.590 align:start position:0%
but uh that's what's in the
bag

04:50:58.590 --> 04:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
bag
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay so just a a little educational
 
04:51:04.590 --> 04:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
Point beyond that there's actually an
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
awful lot of phosphorus in uh New
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
England soils bound up in a nonsoluble
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
form and uh a lot of that some of that
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
phosphorus can be ma made available to
 
04:51:22.750 --> 04:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
plants by various microbial activity um
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
which is a which is one reason that we
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't need to put as much phosphorus on
 
04:51:30.750 --> 04:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
as the as a soil test might initially
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
suggest uh the p205 is a high highly
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
soluble form which means that is very
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
rapidly available to the plants but also
 
04:51:40.830 --> 04:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
can get washed away very rapidly if it's
 
04:51:41.868 --> 04:51:41.878 align:start position:0%
put on in
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
excess uh in addition to that if I might
 
04:51:48.350 --> 04:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the wording in in Roman 5B which
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
would be the signage aart it says most
 
04:51:54.190 --> 04:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire soils
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
provide uh enough phosphorus that's not
 
04:51:59.230 --> 04:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
true they may contain but they don't
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily provide it and there's a
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
myriad as I as I pointed out in somewhat
 
04:52:06.750 --> 04:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
in my email uh there are so many
 
04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
different physical and chemical factors
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that determine how much is
 
04:52:14.270 --> 04:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
available to the plant and that would be
 
04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
typically normally in one of a number of
 
04:52:21.230 --> 04:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
different orthop phosphate uh forms most
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the commercial fertilizers sold or
 
04:52:25.708 --> 04:52:25.718 align:start position:0%
synthetic fertilizers are in either
 
04:52:28.830 --> 04:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
water soluble or citrate soluble orthop
 
04:52:31.230 --> 04:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
phosphates uh and those are much more
 
04:52:33.990 --> 04:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
available uh as represented Bixby said
 
04:52:36.548 --> 04:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
to the plant key is don't put it on
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
there if the plant's not growing so
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
maybe the S the term the the term as far
 
04:52:46.510 --> 04:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
as uh having dates in there the term
 
04:52:49.110 --> 04:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
should be during the growing season only
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:55.868 --> 04:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
season okay and that varies from I live
 
04:52:57.750 --> 04:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
in Lee but the growing season a whole
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh Point well taken
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions or comments
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
from the committee regarding this so it
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
looks like um the direction we're going
 
04:53:16.910 --> 04:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
in with this bill uh as uh
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby is working with
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
these other parties is uh that that we
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
we seek to amend this
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
04:53:30.750 --> 04:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh I guess that's all any
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah do anybody have any
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
all okay all right well thank you
 
04:53:45.150 --> 04:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby for um for your
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
efforts working with uh several parties
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
please let us know if there's anybody
 
04:53:51.470 --> 04:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee that you need
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
assistance from all
 
04:53:59.270 --> 04:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
right moving along to hb1 1294 relative
 
04:54:01.030 --> 04:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
to prohibiting the state of New
 
04:54:03.628 --> 04:54:03.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from enforcing the regulations
 
04:54:06.990 --> 04:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
of the Environmental Protection Agency
 
04:54:09.510 --> 04:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
04:54:12.868 --> 04:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
1294 now we
 
04:54:16.430 --> 04:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
heard uh we heard testimony about this
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill is it first of all I'm interested
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
to know if anybody's working on any kind
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
of amendment on this bill oh
 
04:54:25.910 --> 04:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Penza I see you wildly
 
04:54:28.110 --> 04:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
raising your
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
hand you go right ahead please speak on
 
04:54:35.548 --> 04:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
this then what are you working on so um
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
I don't support the the bill um but I
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
understand the reason why it was put in
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
and as I spoke during testimony so I
 
04:54:49.868 --> 04:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
I'm it this is hard to to navigate in a
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill um you know there's uh constituents
 
04:54:55.030 --> 04:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
that are of course in Rochester um
 
04:54:57.910 --> 04:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
summersworth and in Dober that have um
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
that are kind of flipping out over this
 
04:55:02.190 --> 04:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to tackle this the best
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
way in protect ing overreach and in a
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
sense City or um Municipal governments
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
Town governments from signing on
 
04:55:17.070 --> 04:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
something that is um going to tax um
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
going to tax the the citizens of that of
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
said town or city so that's really where
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
this is happening it's a Rain Tax what
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
and I mean every single person that was
 
04:55:30.830 --> 04:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
on this I don't even know what you want
 
04:55:34.030 --> 04:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
to call it commission study is um was
 
04:55:37.470 --> 04:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
signed by a city manager um that put put
 
04:55:41.350 --> 04:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
each City in a contract um so people's
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
land based upon how much land that they
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
have could get taxed for runoff which is
 
04:55:49.030 --> 04:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
for rain it's really insane um
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh grer uh put in you
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
know let's just abolish it well we can't
 
04:55:57.190 --> 04:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
do that but uh so it's kind of been
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
punted to me and um a constituent in
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
Dober really wants me to work on it so
 
04:56:04.830 --> 04:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
I'm close um hopefully it'll be will be
 
04:56:04.840 --> 04:56:05.628 align:start position:0%
I'm close um hopefully it'll be will be
there

04:56:05.628 --> 04:56:05.638 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:56:11.190 --> 04:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
soon okay so I I just wonder if the
 
04:56:13.910 --> 04:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that you're working on would
 
04:56:16.910 --> 04:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
be considered a non- gerine Amendment or
 
04:56:20.548 --> 04:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
not I mean as the bill is written
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
certainly I I think um I don't want to
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
speak for anybody but me I mean I don't
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
think that we can nullify the EPA but I
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
do believe that there is a problem in
 
04:56:34.628 --> 04:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
that the EPA has got some overreach here
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
they're mandating a community to do
 
04:56:39.868 --> 04:56:39.878 align:start position:0%
something probably Based on data that's
 
04:56:43.628 --> 04:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
not real anymore that's old and it's a a
 
04:56:47.150 --> 04:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
huge burden and cost to that Community
 
04:56:47.160 --> 04:56:48.670 align:start position:0%
huge burden and cost to that Community
um

04:56:48.670 --> 04:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:51.230 --> 04:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
so you know that's my thought on that
 
04:56:54.070 --> 04:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what you know what you
 
04:56:55.390 --> 04:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
might be able to come up with now
 
04:56:58.230 --> 04:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative ger you had a a comment
 
04:57:00.830 --> 04:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
and then I'll have represent ktoa before
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
you speak so I just wanted to speak to
 
04:57:06.350 --> 04:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
German non- derness so the contract is
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
is truly um it's through the EPA in a
 
04:57:11.708 --> 04:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
sense so I think that I mean I've
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
brought it up to um to the clerk he
 
04:57:18.110 --> 04:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
feels it's Germain um because it's a
 
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
we're I'm bringing it down right so
 
04:57:22.590 --> 04:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
we're saying non enforcing anything to
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
non- enforcing something that's very
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
specific okay so so you have spoken to
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
the clerk about it good thank you very
 
04:57:31.548 --> 04:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
much for doing that representative ger
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
your comment yes thank you very much
 
04:57:36.230 --> 04:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair and I wanted to um kind
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
of connecting to to your point Madam
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
chair around data what data we have what
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
data will be ultimately useful uh and
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Bixby and I had a
 
04:57:46.948 --> 04:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
conversation after that hearing with
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
representative grassy from Rochester
 
04:57:52.030 --> 04:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
he's familiar with these issues going
 
04:57:54.868 --> 04:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
back uh years and one of the things that
 
04:57:56.830 --> 04:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
that he pointed out was that there is a
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
dispute over the methodology uh which is
 
04:58:02.110 --> 04:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
being used to determine the levels uh in
 
04:58:04.548 --> 04:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
the Stream and that the EPA is insisting
 
04:58:07.628 --> 04:58:07.638 align:start position:0%
on a particular methodology which is
 
04:58:09.750 --> 04:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
when the body of water runs at its
 
04:58:11.590 --> 04:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
lowest level uh which is when
 
04:58:13.430 --> 04:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
concentrations are going to be the
 
04:58:15.868 --> 04:58:15.878 align:start position:0%
highest um as opposed to obviously other
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
times of year when you're talking about
 
04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
much lower concentrations so I wonder um
 
04:58:24.510 --> 04:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
that led me to to to think that aside
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
from legislation that there's more to
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
the to to the issue here that the state
 
04:58:33.110 --> 04:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
in its work with the EPA uh
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative Grassi was saying that
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
there are ways that the state would be
 
04:58:39.868 --> 04:58:39.878 align:start position:0%
able to apply a different methodology
 
04:58:41.230 --> 04:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
and then the outcome is going to be
 
04:58:43.708 --> 04:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
different but that requires I think and
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
represented Bixby might be able to you
 
04:58:48.910 --> 04:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
know your memory may be better uh uh
 
04:58:50.510 --> 04:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
than mind with this but the state would
 
04:58:53.270 --> 04:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
have to take over certain activities
 
04:58:55.590 --> 04:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
that are currently being done by the EPA
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
in order for us to apply the methodology
 
04:59:00.150 --> 04:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's something that I would
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
like to see explored because I I I see I
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
think this is a real issue I wish the
 
04:59:07.470 --> 04:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
bill had addressed the real issue and
 
04:59:09.990 --> 04:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that this question about how
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
we determine the concentration is
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
extremely important and what the EPA
 
04:59:16.670 --> 04:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
does as opposed to what the state is
 
04:59:17.670 --> 04:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
able to
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
um representative Granger brought this
 
04:59:28.548 --> 04:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
bill before us not to nullify the EPA
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
but to use it as a placeholder to
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
educate this committ committee on on on
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
this ongoing
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
issue I truly believe that is an
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon this committee that we
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
study this issue to get to the best
 
04:59:44.548 --> 04:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
possible um solution for these
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
communities and it would be my
 
04:59:48.868 --> 04:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation to an to do an interim
 
04:59:51.548 --> 04:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
study on this
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill represent VI so
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
um I um I also there recognize and I
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
know that there is a real problem that
 
05:00:06.030 --> 05:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
is being responded to with this bill uh
 
05:00:08.230 --> 05:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
the bill as written is not a good
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
response to it I think we all recognize
 
05:00:15.390 --> 05:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
that uh one of the so um there are two
 
05:00:19.868 --> 05:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
things that come to mind one is that uh
 
05:00:21.830 --> 05:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is this is something that clearly
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
needs study another thing that comes to
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
mind is that this is about this is about
 
05:00:29.910 --> 05:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
a water quality issue and it is not
 
05:00:32.430 --> 05:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
really the official purview of our
 
05:00:34.910 --> 05:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
committee this would be bet the people
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
who are on the resources committee
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
actually know this territory much better
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
than we do uh so that's that's a couple
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
of thoughts the other another thing is
 
05:00:48.390 --> 05:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
that um we have in the room right now
 
05:00:51.510 --> 05:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
someone from the Water Division at Dees
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
who might be able to give us a little
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
bit more information about how this what
 
05:00:58.350 --> 05:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
how this process is working if you'd be
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
willing to to come up and speak so Mr
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:11.670 --> 05:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon Mr deers
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
Welcome to our committee thank you and
 
05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
um Enlighten
 
05:01:19.470 --> 05:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
us all right so for the record my name
 
05:01:22.110 --> 05:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
is Ted deers I am the assistant director
 
05:01:23.628 --> 05:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
of The Water Division at the New
 
05:01:25.590 --> 05:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
05:01:28.110 --> 05:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
Services I have been working on Great
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
Bay issues for about 20 years so I have
 
05:01:34.510 --> 05:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
some familiarity uh with the situation
 
05:01:37.070 --> 05:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
out there and I will say that it is
 
05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
complex uh as has been intimated uh I
 
05:01:42.548 --> 05:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
think through this discussion and it's
 
05:01:45.670 --> 05:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
an interesting uh uh what I like to call
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
the dance between the federal state
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
local uh laws and regulations so um the
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
basic story is this is that in the early
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
2000s we began measuring uh in a robust
 
05:02:02.030 --> 05:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
way uh nitrogen levels in Great Bay over
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
the last 20 to 30 years we've seen a
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
dramatic decrease in the uh eelgrass
 
05:02:09.150 --> 05:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
which is a fundamental part of Great Bay
 
05:02:11.230 --> 05:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
we've also seen a dramatic loss of
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
shellfish about 98% of the original
 
05:02:15.230 --> 05:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
oysters that were in Great Bay are no
 
05:02:17.628 --> 05:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
longer there we've seen a degradation of
 
05:02:19.470 --> 05:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
water quality in the rivers that flow
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
into Great Bay with low dissolved oxygen
 
05:02:23.788 --> 05:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
which is bad for fish and we've seen
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
other uh effects such as increase of
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
macroalgae that is sort of nuisance
 
05:02:30.750 --> 05:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
algae that that floats around in the bay
 
05:02:32.070 --> 05:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
all of these things have some
 
05:02:34.670 --> 05:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
implication back to nutrients so this is
 
05:02:36.190 --> 05:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
where we get to the conversation about
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
nutrients and why it ended up probably
 
05:02:41.788 --> 05:02:41.798 align:start position:0%
in your committee so the the issue there
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
is is in F phosphorus is a problem which
 
05:02:45.830 --> 05:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about uh largely in
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers nitrogen is a problem
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
in estuaries and and in the ocean and so
 
05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
the the challenge there is that you know
 
05:02:57.548 --> 05:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
n nutrients are like it's it's food
 
05:03:00.510 --> 05:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
right everything needs food um if you're
 
05:03:02.230 --> 05:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
hungry and you eat one hamburger you
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
feel pretty afterwards uh if you're
 
05:03:06.030 --> 05:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
hungry and eat a dozen hamburgers you
 
05:03:08.110 --> 05:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
don't feel so good afterwards this is
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
the same issue and so in the Great Bay
 
05:03:12.310 --> 05:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
as this started to become documented
 
05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
well documented they were looking at the
 
05:03:16.830 --> 05:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
relationships between nutrient nutrient
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
levels and and we can get very much into
 
05:03:20.788 --> 05:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
the weeds if we want to talk about the
 
05:03:22.150 --> 05:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
difference between concentration and
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
load which is fundamentally the
 
05:03:27.150 --> 05:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
disagreement uh over the numbers uh the
 
05:03:29.390 --> 05:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
EPA has put forward we can get to that
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
later but the issue really is how much
 
05:03:34.910 --> 05:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
is to too much and so understanding how
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
much is too much has been a very
 
05:03:39.190 --> 05:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
complicated and difficult conversation
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
for a dozen years or more and there have
 
05:03:44.590 --> 05:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
been lawsuits um there's been courses
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
that uh cases that have gone uh through
 
05:03:49.310 --> 05:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
appeal there have been all kinds of
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
permits um and there's been basically a
 
05:03:54.548 --> 05:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
path put forward by EPA uh that
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently we're on and I think that's
 
05:03:58.590 --> 05:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
been been referenced that there is a
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
permit there is a nutrients permit for
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
Great Bay that nutrients permit is the
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
result of the communities around Great
 
05:04:08.948 --> 05:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
Bay asking for a more flexible approach
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
in meeting the reductions that EPA had
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
deemed was necessary in order to restore
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
the Estuary back to its previous health
 
05:04:20.470 --> 05:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
so what they basically did was said okay
 
05:04:22.350 --> 05:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
we'll give you a flexible approach the
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
flexible approach is this either we can
 
05:04:26.350 --> 05:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
regulate your wastewater treatment plant
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
to a very very low level of nitrogen
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
output which is expensive or you you can
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
take on other alternative ways of
 
05:04:37.868 --> 05:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
reducing your nutrient input it could be
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
from um you know protecting uh restoring
 
05:04:43.510 --> 05:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
buffers along streams which has an
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
impact of of reducing nitrogen it could
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
be uh dealing with septic systems in
 
05:04:49.190 --> 05:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
your community it could be dealing with
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
storm water um you know a lot of
 
05:04:52.830 --> 05:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
communities have done a really good job
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
with storm water storm water is probably
 
05:04:58.350 --> 05:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
about 30 to 40% of the nutrients that
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
which is reaching Great Bay comes from
 
05:05:02.548 --> 05:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
Urban storm water Urban runoff that is
 
05:05:04.310 --> 05:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
run off from your driveways from your
 
05:05:07.390 --> 05:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
streets from your Lawns uh all of those
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
05:05:12.190 --> 05:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
activities so so the point the the the
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
challenge of course is that this is
 
05:05:17.110 --> 05:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
monumentally expensive uh If This Were
 
05:05:18.948 --> 05:05:18.958 align:start position:0%
cheap we wouldn't be having this
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
discussion so the just the investments
 
05:05:24.868 --> 05:05:24.878 align:start position:0%
in Wastewater alone Portsmouth just did
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
aund million upgrade exiter just
 
05:05:29.548 --> 05:05:29.558 align:start position:0%
replaced essentially replaced their
 
05:05:31.670 --> 05:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
facility with a 50 million up $50
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
million upgrade
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
New Market has tens of millions of
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in upgrades as does Durham uh
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
all of w whom are trying to really
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
reduce Rochester's done a phenomenal job
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
of reducing its its nitrogen output from
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
its wastewater treatment plant largely
 
05:05:50.910 --> 05:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
by right requiring TurnKey landfill
 
05:05:53.230 --> 05:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
which is which sends its leech eight
 
05:05:56.070 --> 05:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
over to uh to Rochester for them to
 
05:05:59.110 --> 05:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
treat at the site with reverse osmosis
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's been really successful at getting
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
lots of nasties out of the water
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
so all of this sort of comes together in
 
05:06:07.708 --> 05:06:07.718 align:start position:0%
that communities are now making these
 
05:06:10.510 --> 05:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
choices about how do they want to try to
 
05:06:12.750 --> 05:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
meet the permit limits they can either
 
05:06:14.110 --> 05:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
do it through the wastewater treatment
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
plant or they can choose alternative
 
05:06:18.190 --> 05:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
methods and so the communities
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
themselves got together the communities
 
05:06:22.110 --> 05:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
got together to decide how do we want to
 
05:06:23.628 --> 05:06:23.638 align:start position:0%
go about doing this they formed an
 
05:06:25.788 --> 05:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
alliance the municipal Alliance for
 
05:06:28.230 --> 05:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
adaptive management and so it's made up
 
05:06:30.670 --> 05:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
of the communities around Great Bay and
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
they've gotten together to to fund a
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
number of things one of the things that
 
05:06:37.390 --> 05:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
they're funding is the science that is
 
05:06:39.150 --> 05:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
the actual science of what is the right
 
05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
level so how much is really too much so
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's really that's really good they're
 
05:06:44.990 --> 05:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
putting they're putting lots of money
 
05:06:46.830 --> 05:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
towards that they're putting money
 
05:06:49.708 --> 05:06:49.718 align:start position:0%
towards uh best brager practices how do
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
you get how what are the best ways and
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the cheapest ways to get nitrogen out
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they're also putting money into just
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
making sure that they do Outreach
 
05:06:59.628 --> 05:06:59.638 align:start position:0%
together and that they push back on EPA
 
05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
together um and so you know that's been
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
an important part of this is those
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
communities interacting to make sure
 
05:07:08.990 --> 05:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
that they are getting their Fair shake
 
05:07:11.070 --> 05:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
out of the federal government so all of
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
those are going on and I would
 
05:07:13.830 --> 05:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that if you were to go
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
further with this that you would
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
probably want to hear from those
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
communities directly because they're the
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
ones who are really impacted and and
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who are largely you
 
05:07:24.030 --> 05:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
have their own destiny in their hands at
 
05:07:24.040 --> 05:07:24.788 align:start position:0%
have their own destiny in their hands at
this

05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:07:27.270 --> 05:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
moment that permit this General permit
 
05:07:30.150 --> 05:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be re um you know reissued
 
05:07:32.910 --> 05:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
here in the next year or so
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
relative what we're seeing so far is
 
05:07:36.708 --> 05:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
that EPA is relatively pleased with the
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
progress that's been made and that that
 
05:07:42.110 --> 05:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
General permit is likely to be reissued
 
05:07:44.830 --> 05:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
at the same time there's huge NSF study
 
05:07:46.110 --> 05:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
as well as some other funding that's
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
gone into work at UNH as well as and the
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
communities have been contributing to
 
05:07:52.030 --> 05:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
that on the orders of hundreds of
 
05:07:54.670 --> 05:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars a year in order to
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
get a better answer to this question of
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
how much is too much so that's going to
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
be ongoing and over the next couple
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
years as that science is really
 
05:08:04.150 --> 05:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
completed and we have a much better
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
understanding somebody mentioned the
 
05:08:06.830 --> 05:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
data and the timing on the data and all
 
05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
of that there's a lot of work going on
 
05:08:11.150 --> 05:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
right now I'm hoping that over the next
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
couple of years before the the
 
05:08:15.788 --> 05:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
reissuance of the permit again that
 
05:08:17.750 --> 05:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
there will be an ability to be able to
 
05:08:20.430 --> 05:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
have a much better number uh this idea
 
05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
of how much is too much so I know that
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a whirlwind trip
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
through um the trials and tribulations
 
05:08:30.430 --> 05:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
of the nutrient issue on Great Bay for
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
the last couple of decades but but
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what got us here and it
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
is a pretty complex issue um my my
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
question is is the apaa asking for
 
05:08:43.590 --> 05:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
unattainable that's a great question and
 
05:08:48.750 --> 05:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
the answer is that EPA doesn't think so
 
05:08:50.990 --> 05:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
and the Clean Water Act doesn't care
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you the federal
 
05:08:54.910 --> 05:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
Clean Water Act says you're going to get
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
to a certain point if it does if it is
 
05:08:59.230 --> 05:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
unattainable then they you know you can
 
05:09:01.830 --> 05:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
do only what you can do but at this
 
05:09:03.628 --> 05:09:03.638 align:start position:0%
point it's not clear that it's
 
05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
unattainable and so those restrictions
 
05:09:08.310 --> 05:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
will you know continue to be placed on
 
05:09:10.270 --> 05:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
the communities are there exemptions
 
05:09:11.830 --> 05:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
that EPA will
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
allow there are exemptions uh there are
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions that they put into these
 
05:09:17.788 --> 05:09:17.798 align:start position:0%
permits relative to how well the
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
community um you
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
know how how hard is it for them to get
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
there they can put time extensions on
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
things they have been very flexible on
 
05:09:30.270 --> 05:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
some of those things so yeah there there
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
are some exceptions but really those are
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
you know the Clean Water Act is
 
05:09:35.470 --> 05:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
relatively strict on how that works
 
05:09:37.030 --> 05:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
because I know you know in dealing with
 
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government especially in in
 
05:09:41.750 --> 05:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
my towns where we're dealing with FEMA
 
05:09:44.548 --> 05:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
for instance and then I know they're two
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
totally different worlds but you know
 
05:09:49.868 --> 05:09:49.878 align:start position:0%
there there are some things that a rural
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
community can't deliver to FEMA when
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
we're looking for reimbursement for
 
05:09:58.510 --> 05:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
flood damage or whatever and we can work
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
with them through Department of Homeland
 
05:10:02.548 --> 05:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
Security to sort of run inter
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
for the small towns and Rural
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
communities that can't meet
 
05:10:11.190 --> 05:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
certain um Expectations by the federal
 
05:10:14.030 --> 05:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
government and I'm wondering is that
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
what you guys in dees are doing to help
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
these communities who are finding that
 
05:10:24.430 --> 05:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
some of these requirements from the EPA
 
05:10:28.030 --> 05:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
are too honorous and too expensive that
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
um their their tax base simply can't
 
05:10:34.110 --> 05:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
afford the kinds of things that EPA is
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
requesting them to do do you guys run
 
05:10:38.070 --> 05:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
interference for that
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
Community um to help them obtain some of
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
these exemptions you bet we thank you
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
for the question we we definitely um
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
work very closely with the communities
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
to try to get them the best shake that
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
they can we don't write the permit EPA
 
05:10:55.110 --> 05:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
writes the permit so so we are in a
 
05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
position where we you know sitting in
 
05:10:59.310 --> 05:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
between the communities and EPA that
 
05:11:03.030 --> 05:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
said we have provided um as much funding
 
05:11:05.430 --> 05:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
and as much flexibility on funding as we
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
possibly can lots of loan
 
05:11:11.230 --> 05:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
forgiveness um we have $185 million of
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
arpa funds that we're currently putting
 
05:11:14.548 --> 05:11:14.558 align:start position:0%
towards water infrastructure in the
 
05:11:16.830 --> 05:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
state many many of those dollars are
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to the communities uh around Great
 
05:11:21.628 --> 05:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
Bay and and in that Watershed to be able
 
05:11:24.350 --> 05:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
to upgrade their facilities our srf
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
grants we've done a lot of those as well
 
05:11:28.548 --> 05:11:28.558 align:start position:0%
as with and with loan forgiveness there
 
05:11:31.628 --> 05:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
as well so we're trying as hard as we
 
05:11:31.638 --> 05:11:32.470 align:start position:0%
as well so we're trying as hard as we
can

05:11:32.470 --> 05:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh to fund uh to the best we can to help
 
05:11:37.110 --> 05:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
those communities to find the funding to
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
do the work that they um need to do
 
05:11:43.830 --> 05:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
because the bottom line is that um the
 
05:11:46.628 --> 05:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
cost to doing these kinds of projects
 
05:11:48.470 --> 05:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
and and everybody wants clean water
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
everybody wants uh to have great Bay
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
look great and and not be you know
 
05:12:00.350 --> 05:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
problematic but there there has to be
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of um B bance between what the
 
05:12:06.190 --> 05:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
communities can afford in terms of their
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
taxation uh and what can be delivered uh
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of of trying
 
05:12:17.350 --> 05:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
to Monitor and prevent clean up whatever
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
the issues having to do with
 
05:12:23.150 --> 05:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
nitrogen I'm representative
 
05:12:26.030 --> 05:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
kraton Mr deers thank you madam chair Mr
 
05:12:28.750 --> 05:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
deers is as always it's nice to hear
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
from you it's you're on the other side
 
05:12:31.830 --> 05:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the wall what happened I don't know
 
05:12:33.270 --> 05:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
you you got lost
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh so as I read this bill
 
05:12:39.470 --> 05:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's acute pain going on
 
05:12:41.548 --> 05:12:41.558 align:start position:0%
right now and what you describe to me as
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
a process of give and take between local
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
state and federal and that it's painful
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
but they're going through it but are you
 
05:12:53.310 --> 05:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
aware of why we have a bill in front of
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
us saying to abolish the
 
05:12:57.788 --> 05:12:57.798 align:start position:0%
EPA not really I I I sort of understood
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
it had something to do maybe with Milton
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
or do I wasn't quite sure EX what was
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
the the the situation and happy to you
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
know hear more about that absolutely
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you question representative
 
05:13:16.030 --> 05:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so um I'm wondering is uh is
 
05:13:19.910 --> 05:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
there something that uh you need you
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
would need from the legislature in order
 
05:13:25.470 --> 05:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
to enable you to uh work better with
 
05:13:25.480 --> 05:13:28.030 align:start position:0%
to enable you to uh work better with
this

05:13:28.030 --> 05:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue it's a good question um you know
 
05:13:34.510 --> 05:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
money always helps
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh so so there again there's a couple of
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of decision points here
 
05:13:42.430 --> 05:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
um one is
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
that is this idea of you know how do we
 
05:13:48.190 --> 05:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
determine what that right level of
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
nitrogen is and it's a and it's a really
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
seriously complex research question that
 
05:13:54.510 --> 05:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
has engaged you know dozens of
 
05:13:58.150 --> 05:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
researchers right now so certainly
 
05:14:00.070 --> 05:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
getting that through that will help to
 
05:14:03.150 --> 05:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
inform whatever is the next permit just
 
05:14:04.990 --> 05:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
to explain sort of this in in some in
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
some rough terms there's there's been
 
05:14:09.390 --> 05:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
serious controversy about what's
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
actually causing the problem in Great
 
05:14:16.150 --> 05:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
Bay is it is it too much nutrients is it
 
05:14:18.270 --> 05:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
is it too many too much sediments coming
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
out of the rivers into the Great Bay is
 
05:14:23.350 --> 05:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
it a combination of things which are the
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
driving forces that are causing this to
 
05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
happen because it's it's this this idea
 
05:14:31.270 --> 05:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
that certainly in all other estuaries
 
05:14:33.150 --> 05:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
that we know know of around the world if
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
you put too many nutrients in they cause
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
bad things to happen so so so that
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
certainly has driven a lot of the the
 
05:14:42.868 --> 05:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
permitting to date is understanding that
 
05:14:44.670 --> 05:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
from other places but understanding it
 
05:14:46.110 --> 05:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
better here so that is one place in
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
which you know I think continuing to to
 
05:14:50.110 --> 05:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
put pressure
 
05:14:52.910 --> 05:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
on uh to be able to get to those kinds
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
of answers are fundamentally at the end
 
05:14:57.310 --> 05:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
of the day what will drive uh what's
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to go into the next set of
 
05:15:02.430 --> 05:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
permits represent Marie
 
05:15:03.948 --> 05:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um thank you for
 
05:15:06.430 --> 05:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I guess my
 
05:15:08.750 --> 05:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
question to you would be as far as I I
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
think I understood you said UNH was
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
undertaking some of this the study on
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
what causation versus correlation I
 
05:15:17.030 --> 05:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
guess to kind of talk about some things
 
05:15:19.470 --> 05:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
um when do you expect to see some of
 
05:15:22.990 --> 05:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
that data coming back to you yeah I I
 
05:15:24.430 --> 05:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
expect that you're going to see some
 
05:15:27.470 --> 05:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
pretty significant um uh papers coming
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
out in the next year because that really
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
is what's going to
 
05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
um you that's when that research is
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
largely going to have some conclusions
 
05:15:38.548 --> 05:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
to it and that will start a long process
 
05:15:40.628 --> 05:15:40.638 align:start position:0%
I mean because once you sort of
 
05:15:43.350 --> 05:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
understand what's a more appropriate
 
05:15:46.430 --> 05:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
level of of of nutrients that that we
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
should be shooting
 
05:15:49.830 --> 05:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
for it's going to set off a whole chain
 
05:15:51.590 --> 05:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
reaction of well then how do you
 
05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually figure out who's responsible
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
for that and and that that will then
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
take a while for that to get figured out
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is not this is it's taken a long
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
time to get to this point it's going to
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
take a while to get back out of it so
 
05:16:08.830 --> 05:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
then my question is if if we don't know
 
05:16:11.030 --> 05:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
specifically what's causing the problems
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
in Great Bay how can
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
we how how does the EPA then come out
 
05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
and say well you have to do X Y and
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
Z if they don't know what the problem
 
05:16:28.590 --> 05:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
really is why are they mandating us to
 
05:16:31.230 --> 05:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
do things that may or may not solve the
 
05:16:32.750 --> 05:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
problem well because they pretty sure
 
05:16:35.548 --> 05:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
that they know what the problem is okay
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
gocha okay representative
 
05:16:41.230 --> 05:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:16:44.270 --> 05:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
call so when we had the public hearing
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
the the message that I got from the
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
people that spoke in favor of this bill
 
05:16:51.590 --> 05:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
um was that they can't afford it they
 
05:16:54.030 --> 05:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
don't want it and there's no problem
 
05:16:57.788 --> 05:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
okay and how you know so so I saw it as
 
05:17:00.830 --> 05:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
an issue of we don't want to be taxed
 
05:17:03.628 --> 05:17:03.638 align:start position:0%
for it I'm not sure that that's clear
 
05:17:06.548 --> 05:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
but I would say you know in nashwa where
 
05:17:10.510 --> 05:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
I live we have combined sewer overflows
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've been you know I think 35 years ago
 
05:17:15.708 --> 05:17:15.718 align:start position:0%
when they tore up my street they took
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
the storm water you know I mean they've
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
been doing that uh we now have a charge
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
every quarter for wastewater treatment
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
um you know it costs us a lot of money
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
to do that so I mean if we have to do
 
05:17:32.430 --> 05:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
that in in places like like Manchester
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
and and man Manchester and
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
Nashville then you know why should rural
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
communities be exempt from having clean
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
water you know having wastewater
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities that meet
 
05:17:47.868 --> 05:17:47.878 align:start position:0%
specifications just because they don't
 
05:17:49.788 --> 05:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
think they can afford it is that what
 
05:17:52.830 --> 05:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
you're hearing as part of the argument
 
05:17:55.350 --> 05:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
because that seemed to come through to
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
me when I when I heard it and I not sure
 
05:17:59.868 --> 05:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
it's correct yeah no it's it's a great
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
question I think the question is one of
 
05:18:03.948 --> 05:18:03.958 align:start position:0%
proportionality right that those who are
 
05:18:06.510 --> 05:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
the most responsible for the problem
 
05:18:08.548 --> 05:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
hold the greatest you know
 
05:18:10.990 --> 05:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility to try to fix it and what
 
05:18:12.788 --> 05:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
we know about Great Bay is that those
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
communities which are closer into Great
 
05:18:17.868 --> 05:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
Bay bear more of the responsibility so
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
you know the doers and portsmiths and
 
05:18:22.590 --> 05:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
and exitor um they certainly have a
 
05:18:24.708 --> 05:18:24.718 align:start position:0%
great deal more
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
of if you look at nitrogen inputs that's
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
where more of it is coming from so when
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
you get out towards Milton and some of
 
05:18:33.470 --> 05:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
the other communities
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
surrounding um what you do see is that
 
05:18:38.070 --> 05:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
they're what they're being required to
 
05:18:40.708 --> 05:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
do is much much less than what those
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
other communities are required to do
 
05:18:45.910 --> 05:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
right around the periphery of Great Bay
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
and so that that you you do see that
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
proportionality um that is and that's
 
05:18:53.030 --> 05:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
really about kind of where is the source
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
of this stuff coming
 
05:18:56.750 --> 05:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
from I think does that get out what you
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
sorry it just seemed to me like uh it
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
was a tax issue that that I shouldn't
 
05:19:07.868 --> 05:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it I'm not part of the
 
05:19:10.910 --> 05:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
problem um and and I don't have any
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
money anyway but you know I mean you can
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
use that argument anywhere but in NASA I
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean we just get build for it I mean you
 
05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
know I mean I don't really have a say
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
about wastewater treatment you know I
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
mean you know we have uh combined SW
 
05:19:29.910 --> 05:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
overflows it flow flows into the marac
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
river we've got speci specifications and
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have to meet okay
 
05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
and and it seems to me that other parts
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the state when they have these issues
 
05:19:42.868 --> 05:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
arise um you know they feel that they're
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
being unfairly treated and that they
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
should be exempt and you know I'm not
 
05:19:51.070 --> 05:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
sure why we would even want to consider
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
a bill and I know this is a misplaced
 
05:19:55.548 --> 05:19:55.558 align:start position:0%
bill but why we would want to even
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
consider a bill um that would give
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
priority over to a community when every
 
05:20:05.470 --> 05:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
other community in the state has to meet
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
Clean Water and Wastewater regulations
 
05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I see what you're saying okay
 
05:20:13.470 --> 05:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
representative Penza um and and I I just
 
05:20:15.310 --> 05:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
as a point of order to that um
 
05:20:19.150 --> 05:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
representative ger brought up um I I
 
05:20:20.910 --> 05:20:20.920 align:start position:0%
know that we we need to get a better
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
background about what the problem is
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
that this bill is reporting to solve um
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I understand too that the committee
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
is not uh overall not in favor of of any
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
kind of nullification of the EPA but we
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
do need to have a good understanding of
 
05:20:40.548 --> 05:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
why what what the problem is and if the
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
if in constructing any kind of amendment
 
05:20:46.430 --> 05:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
um that would address that problem I
 
05:20:49.868 --> 05:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
think would would be helpful so
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
um we're we're running a little short on
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
time but I I do want to entertain your
 
05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I have a bunch of questions
 
05:20:59.670 --> 05:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
so I'll just I'll I think I'll just use
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
one so you were talking about um when
 
05:21:05.590 --> 05:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
you were talking about the grape a and
 
05:21:08.708 --> 05:21:08.718 align:start position:0%
what's going in and um
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
nutrients um the one thing that is not
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
being talked about at all has to do with
 
05:21:16.430 --> 05:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
the pollution that's going in Great Bay
 
05:21:18.990 --> 05:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
and and they're they're only they're not
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
really looking at that at all because
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
you're talking about all these changes
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
right they're they're not looking at
 
05:21:26.270 --> 05:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
that they're they're they're wanting to
 
05:21:28.708 --> 05:21:28.718 align:start position:0%
pin it on nitrogen and all that kind of
 
05:21:30.230 --> 05:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
stuff so the constituent that I have
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
that's in Dober
 
05:21:34.110 --> 05:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
has literally had UNH done all of the
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
testing she has data that's showing
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's completely conflicting to the EPA
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
she's had a farm for a long time so
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
meaning for her runoff because she has a
 
05:21:47.788 --> 05:21:47.798 align:start position:0%
lot of land and would get a lot it would
 
05:21:52.150 --> 05:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
cost her a lot with this rain tax um so
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
she's got data running through the UNH
 
05:21:57.628 --> 05:21:57.638 align:start position:0%
which is incredible that's showing that
 
05:21:59.230 --> 05:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
the nitrogen levels have actually
 
05:22:02.190 --> 05:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
decreased so and that's that's huge too
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
because we low nitrogen causes all these
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
other types of problems so there's so
 
05:22:08.590 --> 05:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
much conflicting data and I I think it
 
05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
what it really comes down to is this
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
level of overreach but no one's really
 
05:22:16.190 --> 05:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
talking about the pollution into into
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
Great Bay and I don't know if that has
 
05:22:20.350 --> 05:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the sewer systems
 
05:22:22.390 --> 05:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
and all of that kind of stuff but you
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
know I understand that it is you
 
05:22:26.590 --> 05:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
constituents had no idea that this was
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
hitting them and um and there just
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
hadn't been any communication
 
05:22:35.350 --> 05:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
and at that do it all started with a um
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
with a do city council meeting when it
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
was unanimously you know uh shut down in
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
regards with like the Rain Tax so and
 
05:22:44.430 --> 05:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to ask you was
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
money like you said money so you know
 
05:22:49.070 --> 05:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
what could you have what what do you
 
05:22:51.670 --> 05:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
need the money for is my question you
 
05:22:53.910 --> 05:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
said what are you looking for money for
 
05:22:56.708 --> 05:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
if I had one so this great great
 
05:22:58.150 --> 05:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
question what would I do if I had a
 
05:23:00.548 --> 05:23:00.558 align:start position:0%
million dollars um or or a 10 million or
 
05:23:02.830 --> 05:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
100 milli ion what we would do is we
 
05:23:05.868 --> 05:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
would pass it to the communities so
 
05:23:08.030 --> 05:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we do with money that we get
 
05:23:09.628 --> 05:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
so if there were dollars if the
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
communities had needs uh to treat
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
pollution because that's really what we
 
05:23:16.350 --> 05:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
are talking about I mean we are talking
 
05:23:18.548 --> 05:23:18.558 align:start position:0%
about pollution now again there's
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
certain components of that pollution
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
which cause various different things to
 
05:23:24.708 --> 05:23:24.718 align:start position:0%
happen in the environment um and I will
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
just say that the UNH is also looking at
 
05:23:28.030 --> 05:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
things other than nutrients they're
 
05:23:30.110 --> 05:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
looking at a lot of things but it's not
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
just nutrients
 
05:23:33.708 --> 05:23:33.718 align:start position:0%
because there are lots of different what
 
05:23:35.708 --> 05:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
they call confounding factors involved
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
this this idea of correlation versus
 
05:23:40.190 --> 05:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
causation getting a better handle on
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
what's the causation so you know I think
 
05:23:45.030 --> 05:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
if there were dollars to be spent it
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be from for things the very things
 
05:23:48.948 --> 05:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
you're talking about getting a better
 
05:23:51.390 --> 05:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
handle on storm water getting a because
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's where the that's where so many of
 
05:23:55.510 --> 05:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
those nitrogen that is coming from the
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
the the nutrients are coming from storm
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
water so if you're looking at where's
 
05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
that storm water coming from well it's
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
coming from you know parking lots and
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and and driveways and sidewalks and
 
05:24:08.190 --> 05:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
Lawns and all of that other stuff so
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
yeah if if if there were dollars to be
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
spent on things and again we were
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
blessed with $185 Million worth of arpa
 
05:24:17.868 --> 05:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
funds all of those dollars are going out
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
to communities just like yours
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so we've been
 
05:24:27.030 --> 05:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill for a while and I
 
05:24:28.990 --> 05:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
think one thing that is very clear is
 
05:24:31.708 --> 05:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get it resolved on uh
 
05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
this afternoon right uh I think that we
 
05:24:37.628 --> 05:24:37.638 align:start position:0%
have a couple of a few potential paths
 
05:24:41.390 --> 05:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward uh one is we could just throw up
 
05:24:43.470 --> 05:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
our hands and say it's too hard and itl
 
05:24:47.230 --> 05:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
it another is that we could say we're
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
not going to solve it in the next two
 
05:24:53.910 --> 05:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
weeks maybe we should um take this on as
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
an interim study in our committee
 
05:24:58.230 --> 05:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
another possibility would be to convert
 
05:24:59.990 --> 05:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
it into a study committee and see if we
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
could get uh a couple members of
 
05:25:05.628 --> 05:25:05.638 align:start position:0%
resources onto that study committee
 
05:25:09.628 --> 05:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
because uh that resources really has a
 
05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
much broader sense of experience with
 
05:25:14.190 --> 05:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
this bill than we do but I I would
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
propose that we um bring our
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
conversation to this bill on this bill
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
to an end and and consider one of those
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
two study options as a as what we should
 
05:25:27.510 --> 05:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
be thinking about going
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
forward I
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:32.670 align:start position:0%
forward I
agree

05:25:32.670 --> 05:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
agree
 
05:25:34.030 --> 05:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
okay just a quick question
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Penza yeah for
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby so if this went to
 
05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
the second piece that you said in
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
regards with um a study committee that
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
could possibly have um some resources
 
05:25:50.030 --> 05:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
folks on it would then would we pull
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
legis I mean depending on what is the
 
05:25:54.628 --> 05:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
goal of that to possibly put forward
 
05:25:54.638 --> 05:25:56.230 align:start position:0%
goal of that to possibly put forward
legislation

05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
or yes so the goal of a study committee
 
05:26:01.190 --> 05:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh look at the look at the look at the
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
entire issue uh and bring in as many
 
05:26:10.670 --> 05:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
experts as we can to explain to the
 
05:26:14.430 --> 05:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
study committee uh what What's what the
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
issues are and uh what the possible ways
 
05:26:19.548 --> 05:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
of dealing with it it are and then the
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
study committee would uh look at the
 
05:26:25.990 --> 05:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
information they had and say this is
 
05:26:30.110 --> 05:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
something for which we have a potential
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh leg legislative solution or at least
 
05:26:34.510 --> 05:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
some legislation that could help and
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
then they would file that legislation
 
05:26:42.270 --> 05:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
for next uh next term uh and so that's
 
05:26:45.150 --> 05:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh and I would be lean more towards a
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
study committee rather than a study
 
05:26:49.390 --> 05:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
interim study because with a study
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
committee we could get people from
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
resources onto it agree yeah represent
 
05:26:57.470 --> 05:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and I just
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh just sort of
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
bring back into the fact that there is
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
some ongoing research out there that
 
05:27:09.350 --> 05:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're expecting data within the next
 
05:27:12.190 --> 05:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
calendar year so how does that factor
 
05:27:15.350 --> 05:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
into the the the study Avenue that we're
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
instructing people to go down well I
 
05:27:21.390 --> 05:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
think that um the people who are
 
05:27:24.110 --> 05:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
studying it from UNH and from Dees would
 
05:27:25.830 --> 05:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
definitely be on the list of people
 
05:27:27.270 --> 05:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
invited to speak with the study
 
05:27:30.030 --> 05:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee even though it's not yes
 
05:27:30.040 --> 05:27:32.310 align:start position:0%
committee even though it's not yes
because

05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
in research is always ongoing and
 
05:27:38.350 --> 05:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's always some information that new
 
05:27:39.708 --> 05:27:39.718 align:start position:0%
information that you have actually
 
05:27:41.470 --> 05:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
figured out and there's always something
 
05:27:44.350 --> 05:27:44.360 align:start position:0%
that you still realize you need to look
 
05:27:47.670 --> 05:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
into further so uh there's there's not
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a point where suddenly we
 
05:27:52.110 --> 05:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
know everything it's going to be so I
 
05:27:53.628 --> 05:27:53.638 align:start position:0%
think the study committee will be able
 
05:27:55.948 --> 05:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the most current
 
05:27:58.708 --> 05:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
information is and use that in order to
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
make a judgment about legis future
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
legislation okay all right I think we've
 
05:28:10.110 --> 05:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
said enough about hb12
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
94 let's move on to cacr 14 thank you Mr
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
deers for uh lending us
 
05:28:20.230 --> 05:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
sometime uh cacr 14 relating to the
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
environment and natural resources
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
providing that the state shall maintain
 
05:28:25.390 --> 05:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
and improve a clean and healthful
 
05:28:28.390 --> 05:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
environment for present and future
 
05:28:31.510 --> 05:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
Generations um I open it up to comments
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:42.030 --> 05:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
this okay I don't see Hands flying up in
 
05:28:42.040 --> 05:28:42.708 align:start position:0%
this okay I don't see Hands flying up in
the

05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:46.350 --> 05:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
air yeah go ahead representative
 
05:28:49.910 --> 05:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair uh looking
 
05:28:49.920 --> 05:28:50.670 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair uh looking
at

05:28:50.670 --> 05:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:28:52.670 --> 05:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
cicr uh
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
14 um I agree with everything that's in
 
05:28:58.590 --> 05:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
it but I don't think
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of going into the as a cacr
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's already in there and that
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh it it could Cloud the issue further
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:29:13.708 --> 05:29:13.718 align:start position:0%
uh I agree with it but in the testimony
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
we heard it just it seemed to me that
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
was redundant and it would cloud the
 
05:29:19.788 --> 05:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
issue rather than amplify the
 
05:29:19.798 --> 05:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
issue rather than amplify the
issue

05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:29:25.390 --> 05:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
over okay representative Bixby yes so um
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I I think I'm probably going to
 
05:29:31.390 --> 05:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
come to the same uh end point as my
 
05:29:36.110 --> 05:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
colleague but um I I think that uh as
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
written it does not
 
05:29:38.080 --> 05:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
written it does not
really

05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:29:42.868 --> 05:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh it it does not quite capture the
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
issue exactly and I think it may in fact
 
05:29:49.590 --> 05:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
be a useful thing to have something like
 
05:29:51.628 --> 05:29:51.638 align:start position:0%
that in the Constitution at some point
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that the language as
 
05:29:58.030 --> 05:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
presented is uh good enough I also think
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
that it is very unlik to get very far in
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
this legislature so I think there's no
 
05:30:07.948 --> 05:30:07.958 align:start position:0%
point in spending much effort on it and
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
I would um be inclined to say this
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
should be an
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
I I would be in agreement with that
 
05:30:14.638 --> 05:30:16.430 align:start position:0%
I I would be in agreement with that
representative

05:30:16.430 --> 05:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:30:19.628 --> 05:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
Bixby representative ger you have your
 
05:30:22.430 --> 05:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
hand up yes I do thank you madam chair
 
05:30:22.440 --> 05:30:23.270 align:start position:0%
hand up yes I do thank you madam chair
uh

05:30:23.270 --> 05:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:30:25.470 --> 05:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
I kind to see the path that that we're
 
05:30:27.628 --> 05:30:27.638 align:start position:0%
going on I understand that I accept that
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
but uh I I do want to to say that you
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
know we've seen recently in Wyoming the
 
05:30:35.470 --> 05:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
the impact that something like this can
 
05:30:37.628 --> 05:30:37.638 align:start position:0%
have to actually have a constitution
 
05:30:39.470 --> 05:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
Montana thank you I'm sorry Montana
 
05:30:42.350 --> 05:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you uh that that there are real
 
05:30:44.350 --> 05:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
world consequences for having something
 
05:30:46.990 --> 05:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
like this in your Constitution uh that
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:30:51.030 --> 05:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
prioritize natural resources in public
 
05:30:52.910 --> 05:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
health uh then at some point the rubber
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
has to has to hit the road and the
 
05:30:57.150 --> 05:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution is the place where we uh
 
05:30:59.310 --> 05:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
enshrine where we codify the rights that
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
are to be protected
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
to me these rights are as fundamental as
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
any other so uh I I understand as I said
 
05:31:08.910 --> 05:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
where we're headed I I accept the
 
05:31:10.628 --> 05:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
reality of it but I I do also want to
 
05:31:13.030 --> 05:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
say that I think that a point that I
 
05:31:14.510 --> 05:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
made during the hearing I'd like to just
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
reiterate which is that particularly
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to Dees one of my
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
frustrations I tremendous respect for
 
05:31:22.430 --> 05:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
the folks at Dees and the work that they
 
05:31:24.510 --> 05:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
do but it is not oriented toward
 
05:31:26.670 --> 05:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Environmental
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
Services I've had this discussion with
 
05:31:29.750 --> 05:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
some folks at Dees before it's a
 
05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
permitting agency you tick the boxes you
 
05:31:35.150 --> 05:31:35.160 align:start position:0%
get the permit that to me is not what
 
05:31:38.590 --> 05:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
that agency should do as you said this
 
05:31:39.708 --> 05:31:39.718 align:start position:0%
is actually a reflection of
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had with with with
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
the director whimsi in particular with
 
05:31:46.390 --> 05:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
regard to why certain things could be
 
05:31:47.590 --> 05:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
done and can't be done and that
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
effectively is the answer uh so in any
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
event I think an amendment like this the
 
05:31:55.350 --> 05:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of it would be to to have the
 
05:31:58.430 --> 05:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
effect of directing agencies like Dees
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
to the job of Environmental Protection
 
05:32:04.270 --> 05:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
which is not the fundamental mission of
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
Dees as it currently
 
05:32:10.548 --> 05:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
exists represent dsy yeah uh just
 
05:32:13.830 --> 05:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
quickly I I agree with the you know that
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
this is not the vehicle but I also think
 
05:32:18.270 --> 05:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
that we might want to do an ad hoc
 
05:32:21.230 --> 05:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee to see uh about putting a bill
 
05:32:23.868 --> 05:32:23.878 align:start position:0%
forward and that's primarily I think
 
05:32:27.628 --> 05:32:27.638 align:start position:0%
because um it can be a symbol of Hope um
 
05:32:30.150 --> 05:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
for young people uh you know I've been
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
reading recently how young people feel
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
that um very hopeless about the fact
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
that their environment is being trashed
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
and there's nothing that they can do
 
05:32:42.910 --> 05:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
about it and I think for us to have some
 
05:32:46.190 --> 05:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a statement like this in our
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
constitution uh sets up you know a a
 
05:32:53.110 --> 05:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
goal uh shows that we are concerned and
 
05:32:55.910 --> 05:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we want to leave a better Planet
 
05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know to Future Generations uh than
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
what we have right now
 
05:33:03.548 --> 05:33:03.558 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you madam
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
chair just to agree I think we are alone
 
05:33:10.750 --> 05:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
or almost alone with the District of
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
Colombia in not having something like
 
05:33:17.430 --> 05:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
the protection of our environment and it
 
05:33:22.430 --> 05:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
was such a surprise to me when I started
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
that I should have known but I did not
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
know that the Department of
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services was not here here
 
05:33:32.910 --> 05:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the environment so I must
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
agree with the two or four mentioned
 
05:33:37.470 --> 05:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
speakers that we should have it in our
 
05:33:39.708 --> 05:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
constitution because I don't believe
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
it's happening in quite the way I hoped
 
05:33:44.990 --> 05:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
it would thank
 
05:33:48.030 --> 05:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
you I would just say that
 
05:33:51.070 --> 05:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that it should be put
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
into our constitution I don't think that
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's the place for it I also believe
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
that um and New Hampshire Dees is not
 
05:34:01.230 --> 05:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
just a permitting agency or regulatory
 
05:34:03.788 --> 05:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
agency they have a mission statement
 
05:34:06.510 --> 05:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
their mission is the New Hampshire
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services is
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
to help sustain a high quality of life
 
05:34:12.510 --> 05:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
for all citizens by protecting and
 
05:34:14.510 --> 05:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
restoring the environment and Public
 
05:34:16.548 --> 05:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
Health in New Hampshire the protection
 
05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
and wise management of the state's
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
environment are the main goals of the
 
05:34:26.788 --> 05:34:26.798 align:start position:0%
agency so um the state statute RSA
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
21- um Dees was leg legislative created
 
05:34:33.510 --> 05:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislatively Created through the
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
consolidation and reorganization of four
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
previously separated agencies so uh to
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
say that we need a constitutional
 
05:34:46.590 --> 05:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to enshrine uh whatever the
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
wording is in this bill I think is
 
05:34:54.070 --> 05:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's not
 
05:34:54.080 --> 05:34:56.470 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's not
necessary

05:34:56.470 --> 05:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:34:59.548 --> 05:34:59.558 align:start position:0%
representative kraton okay thank you
 
05:35:02.310 --> 05:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
ma'am I I just just for the record I
 
05:35:05.470 --> 05:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
guess which so I I chair the Exotic
 
05:35:07.670 --> 05:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
Aquatic weeds and species committee for
 
05:35:10.230 --> 05:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and that
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
primary one of the primary people on
 
05:35:13.990 --> 05:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
there is from
 
05:35:17.628 --> 05:35:17.638 align:start position:0%
thees and uh I I will tell you that what
 
05:35:19.628 --> 05:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
has been said here about DT Dees could
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
not be further from the truth I mean
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
that that lady on that committee is
 
05:35:27.070 --> 05:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
completely dedicated to the preservation
 
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
of clean Waters in the state and she
 
05:35:32.750 --> 05:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
works overtime more than anyone I know
 
05:35:34.628 --> 05:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
and and will'll respond to anyone in
 
05:35:38.510 --> 05:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
this state and her only or only mission
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
is the preservation and protection of
 
05:35:42.990 --> 05:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
the waters in this state and so to
 
05:35:45.628 --> 05:35:45.638 align:start position:0%
disparage thees as a block checking
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
organization I think is completely
 
05:35:51.190 --> 05:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
disingenuous and so I I don't mean to
 
05:35:53.150 --> 05:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
get upset but these are really good
 
05:35:55.070 --> 05:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
people and they are focused on
 
05:35:57.470 --> 05:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
preserving our environment as it is and
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
that that's just having dealt with them
 
05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
straight up for the last four
 
05:36:04.990 --> 05:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
years get off my stove box
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
thanks sir I appreciate representative
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
Cron's point and and I want to clarify
 
05:36:12.910 --> 05:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
my own which is not about the people who
 
05:36:15.190 --> 05:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
work at Dees I don't doubt that at all
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
and I know as a fact that what
 
05:36:18.430 --> 05:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
representative kraton is true but I also
 
05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
have talked to people at Dees who feel
 
05:36:24.350 --> 05:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
boxed in because the processes are
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
permitting Pro or are are primarily
 
05:36:29.190 --> 05:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
permitting processes I've been in um
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
meetings with the previous was he the
 
05:36:33.990 --> 05:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner Mr sandborne uh
 
05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
who repeatedly made it clear uh that
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
their job was to balance business
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
interests with environmental interests
 
05:36:42.190 --> 05:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh so I I just want to clarify
 
05:36:43.430 --> 05:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative kraton's
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
comments I want to make it clear that I
 
05:36:46.390 --> 05:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
have the greatest respect for the folks
 
05:36:48.510 --> 05:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
at Dees and I've never met anyone there
 
05:36:50.070 --> 05:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
who isn't absolutely committed as
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Katon said it is the
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're the processes within the agency
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
that ultimately do when it comes to air
 
05:36:59.670 --> 05:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
quality permitting for example or
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
landfill permitting if you tick the
 
05:37:04.510 --> 05:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
boxes uh we do not air on the side of
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection right we you
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
check the boxes you get the permit and
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
as you said that is not a reflection of
 
05:37:12.990 --> 05:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
the commitment of the folks in Dees to
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
environment one last comment and then I
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
want to move on
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
please so if we're going to go back to
 
05:37:26.670 --> 05:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional amendment I don't
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary I think there were
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
um lots of point points in there that we
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
are that that are protected you know
 
05:37:35.430 --> 05:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
life liberty property Pursuit of
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
Happiness all I think all those things
 
05:37:40.350 --> 05:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
are um you know even things that are in
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
there that just enshrine with our rights
 
05:37:44.390 --> 05:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
and consent and all that kind of stuff
 
05:37:47.470 --> 05:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
um in regard in being good stewards so
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to piggyback on on what
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative Jama said because I
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
literally have had uh four conversations
 
05:37:58.990 --> 05:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
where I I've been told that same thing
 
05:38:00.310 --> 05:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
that they
 
05:38:04.110 --> 05:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
um they can't they they can't look they
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
it's I don't want to say it's not common
 
05:38:07.270 --> 05:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
sense but they can't look outside that
 
05:38:09.868 --> 05:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
box so if everything you know even
 
05:38:11.910 --> 05:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
though we know something that's a that's
 
05:38:15.548 --> 05:38:15.558 align:start position:0%
an issue we don't um we we don't really
 
05:38:17.310 --> 05:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
look outside of that if everything falls
 
05:38:19.390 --> 05:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
in it falls in line and so it's not
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
process representative kulan thank you
 
05:38:28.470 --> 05:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I just want to say I'm
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
completely against this this bill and I
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
think the only function it would serve
 
05:38:36.628 --> 05:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
is to be a placeholder for court rulings
 
05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah I don't support it okay
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
thank you all right we're gonna move
 
05:38:44.910 --> 05:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
on from
 
05:38:50.350 --> 05:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
cdr4 to discuss um HB 1630 relative to
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%

um can
can

05:39:02.788 --> 05:39:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:05.830 --> 05:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
um okay yeah let's let maybe we should
 
05:39:08.070 --> 05:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
set some time limits here because I know
 
05:39:10.270 --> 05:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
we can have this discussion till 8
 
05:39:10.280 --> 05:39:11.270 align:start position:0%
we can have this discussion till 8
o'clock

05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
05:39:11.280 --> 05:39:15.150 align:start position:0%
o'clock
tonight

05:39:15.150 --> 05:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:19.030 --> 05:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
um for me this is a rather large and
 
05:39:22.150 --> 05:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
complicated uh bill it is introducing a
 
05:39:27.190 --> 05:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
whole new level of um of
 
05:39:33.030 --> 05:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
um government we are uh the es has
 
05:39:35.230 --> 05:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
claimed that that they would need eight
 
05:39:38.230 --> 05:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
positions to support uh the provisions
 
05:39:39.628 --> 05:39:39.638 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:39:39.638 --> 05:39:41.468 align:start position:0%
in this
legislation

05:39:41.468 --> 05:39:41.478 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:39:44.468 --> 05:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
um the bill itself would have a two to
 
05:39:44.478 --> 05:39:46.310 align:start position:0%
um the bill itself would have a two to
foure

05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
foure
 
05:39:46.320 --> 05:39:47.948 align:start position:0%
foure
implementation

05:39:47.948 --> 05:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
05:39:50.548 --> 05:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of work to be done
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
between you know Dees study and
 
05:39:57.110 --> 05:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and it
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
was discussed um
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
in testimony and also amongst some of
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
our colleagues here in the
 
05:40:08.830 --> 05:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
05:40:12.270 --> 05:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
um while there are some states around us
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are either started to implement
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
eppr legislation and those who are
 
05:40:21.948 --> 05:40:21.958 align:start position:0%
considering it
 
05:40:25.030 --> 05:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
um we've yet to see
 
05:40:28.948 --> 05:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
really how the implementation has gone
 
05:40:30.788 --> 05:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
if it's it's gone well if there are
 
05:40:34.830 --> 05:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
things that um could be done better or
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
different and
 
05:40:41.150 --> 05:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
so I think that you know this particular
 
05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill um would need significant amendment
 
05:40:47.230 --> 05:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
to it I don't know if anybody is working
 
05:40:49.590 --> 05:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
on any amendments to this bill but I
 
05:40:53.788 --> 05:40:53.798 align:start position:0%
think the way it is in currently um is
 
05:40:57.548 --> 05:40:57.558 align:start position:0%
probably not ready for for Prime Time
 
05:41:01.948 --> 05:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
representative Duty yes uh Madam chair
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know I agree with you I mean I epr
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
uh we we should be considering epr we
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
should be studying epr and it's not um
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
just focused on EP when we get a very
 
05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
complicated bill that is going to make
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
numerous changes um you know to to the
 
05:41:27.990 --> 05:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of certain processes and
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
and this is a very comp complicated bill
 
05:41:33.628 --> 05:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
I think we owe it to our constituents
 
05:41:36.310 --> 05:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
and everybody to look at it very
 
05:41:39.270 --> 05:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
carefully so I would hope I mean that we
 
05:41:42.750 --> 05:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
use this as as a basis and that and I
 
05:41:44.990 --> 05:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we move forward if it's
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
a study committee but that we have a
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
vehicle where we can study it over the
 
05:41:54.190 --> 05:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
summer where we can bring in experts to
 
05:41:56.390 --> 05:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
really do work sessions not just
 
05:41:59.910 --> 05:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
testimony but work sessions and and uh
 
05:42:03.110 --> 05:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
and try to craft a bill that we submit
 
05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
in the fall that you know could be a
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
first step for New Hampshire you know I
 
05:42:12.030 --> 05:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't want us to bite off so much that
 
05:42:14.350 --> 05:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to fail but I do think that
 
05:42:16.708 --> 05:42:16.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in this bill that we could
 
05:42:19.948 --> 05:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
use as a template to move
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
forward okay um I get to you after me I
 
05:42:27.628 --> 05:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
05:42:32.510 --> 05:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I agree with with you and I think
 
05:42:34.990 --> 05:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of parts of this bill that
 
05:42:36.628 --> 05:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
I would like to see the solid waste
 
05:42:40.030 --> 05:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
working group examine um the the the
 
05:42:42.910 --> 05:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
committee that uh representative eel
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
chairs um I I would love to have the
 
05:42:47.830 --> 05:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group maybe have a
 
05:42:50.390 --> 05:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or something to take a look
 
05:42:52.788 --> 05:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
at the provisions of this kind of
 
05:42:55.590 --> 05:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and see what pieces of it
 
05:42:57.910 --> 05:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
would fit what pieces make sense what
 
05:43:01.628 --> 05:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
don't make sense for New Hampshire so
 
05:43:03.628 --> 05:43:03.638 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I am with that and
 
05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know if we want to then
 
05:43:08.230 --> 05:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
say you know interm
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
study or you know just pass something
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
like this along to the solid waste
 
05:43:17.948 --> 05:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
working group for them to consider
 
05:43:17.958 --> 05:43:19.830 align:start position:0%
working group for them to consider
representative

05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:43:22.830 --> 05:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
brard I I part uh part of me agrees with
 
05:43:25.350 --> 05:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
representive Duty I I think we need to
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
see the proof yeah Maine we need to see
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
the proof Oregon California that this is
 
05:43:33.868 --> 05:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
working for your state it's lessening
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
the financial burdens on
 
05:43:39.788 --> 05:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities um is is that the case is
 
05:43:41.390 --> 05:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
is it putting any additional financial
 
05:43:43.990 --> 05:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
burden on the consumer uh I think we
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
need much more feedback from producers
 
05:43:50.830 --> 05:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
in general what we again I I don't need
 
05:43:54.190 --> 05:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
to hop on the uh initial study committee
 
05:43:59.070 --> 05:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
that I was on but we did not nearly um
 
05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
get as much feedback uh as we should
 
05:44:03.310 --> 05:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
have from from producers from the
 
05:44:05.150 --> 05:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and so I think I think
 
05:44:09.150 --> 05:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
that's the uh the overall uh big one for
 
05:44:12.230 --> 05:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative H Haskins
 
05:44:14.548 --> 05:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm not in a
 
05:44:16.670 --> 05:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
position to know what the best path
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
forward is I wish I did I do know that
 
05:44:21.948 --> 05:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
Source reduction is the number one goal
 
05:44:25.548 --> 05:44:25.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for Waste Management so
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
that line sort of stuck with me as okay
 
05:44:32.030 --> 05:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
here's the problem how do we get there
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
and again it's big it's massive and I
 
05:44:37.510 --> 05:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
wish I had
 
05:44:39.868 --> 05:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
constructive advice about how we get
 
05:44:42.590 --> 05:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
there I just know we have to start we
 
05:44:47.628 --> 05:44:47.638 align:start position:0%
have to make a plan and um I hope that
 
05:44:49.590 --> 05:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
the study committee if that's the way we
 
05:44:52.830 --> 05:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
go could do that well I know with the um
 
05:44:55.628 --> 05:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
the the go key goal of source reduction
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
that the solid waste working group is a
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle is working on that um along with
 
05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders that are on that
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
um the representative from the Senate as
 
05:45:12.070 --> 05:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
well as uh representative from Dees um
 
05:45:15.708 --> 05:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
and I think you know the the key points
 
05:45:17.708 --> 05:45:17.718 align:start position:0%
to this
 
05:45:20.310 --> 05:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
legislation is Source
 
05:45:22.990 --> 05:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
reduction it's how we get there and
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's working
 
05:45:28.868 --> 05:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
elsewhere representative uh Na you had a
 
05:45:29.990 --> 05:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just really want
 
05:45:31.430 --> 05:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
to Second what she had to say which is
 
05:45:33.190 --> 05:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of times during the
 
05:45:36.548 --> 05:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
testimony that reducing the source of of
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
waste was the number one goal of these
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
different committees that have studied
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
it so you know I'm not a fan of asking
 
05:45:43.548 --> 05:45:43.558 align:start position:0%
for study committees and asking for
 
05:45:44.868 --> 05:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
reports and then not following their
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations the other piece that you
 
05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
know I'm sure all of us took from the
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
testimony was the recommendation that it
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
would need it would require eight staff
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
members a Dees so you know I I think
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing an interim study or I think
 
05:46:00.270 --> 05:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
contining to look at this legislation is
 
05:46:02.030 --> 05:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
really important yeah there needs to be
 
05:46:03.510 --> 05:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
a balance between those two things right
 
05:46:04.948 --> 05:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
like we probably don't want to add eight
 
05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
sta people right but we do need to start
 
05:46:08.910 --> 05:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
working on this exactly represent
 
05:46:08.920 --> 05:46:10.110 align:start position:0%
working on this exactly represent
sofikitis

05:46:10.110 --> 05:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
sofikitis
 
05:46:14.110 --> 05:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
is there some mechanism involved with
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
asking the speaker to move this to the
 
05:46:18.590 --> 05:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
solid waste working
 
05:46:21.270 --> 05:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
group um no but you know this is
 
05:46:24.628 --> 05:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
certainly a topic that they are um they
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
have they will have on their plate that
 
05:46:27.788 --> 05:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
they do have on their plate because it
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
is a a one of the mechanisms to achieve
 
05:46:35.510 --> 05:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
um Source reduction representative Bixby
 
05:46:38.590 --> 05:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so one of the uh people who
 
05:46:42.310 --> 05:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
testified uh mentioned that Maryland is
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
doing a um a need to assessment which is
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
a preliminary step to doing uh their epr
 
05:46:52.468 --> 05:46:52.478 align:start position:0%
bill so they don't they don't have they
 
05:46:54.510 --> 05:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
aren't they haven't fleshed out an epr
 
05:46:56.830 --> 05:46:56.840 align:start position:0%
bill as a whole they are doing a needs
 
05:46:58.430 --> 05:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
assessment I don't I haven't looked at
 
05:46:58.440 --> 05:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
assessment I don't I haven't looked at
that

05:46:59.590 --> 05:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:47:03.628 --> 05:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
uh carefully but my sense is that uh
 
05:47:06.910 --> 05:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
what that in involves is having someone
 
05:47:11.070 --> 05:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
in their um their equivalent of Dees who
 
05:47:14.270 --> 05:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
is actually paid to work on figuring out
 
05:47:17.430 --> 05:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
what would need to go into an epr Bill
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh I'm uh I'm wondering if that so I I'm
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
I see two possible ways forward with
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
this uh one is uh seeing if we can mend
 
05:47:30.990 --> 05:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
it to do such a such a needs assessment
 
05:47:33.150 --> 05:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
I think we might it might be tight on
 
05:47:34.948 --> 05:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
the time frame but it it might be
 
05:47:37.070 --> 05:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
possible to to figure out A needs
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
assessment uh bill that would replace
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
this to to create an initial first step
 
05:47:45.110 --> 05:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
the other other possible mechanism would
 
05:47:48.350 --> 05:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
be uh to do an interim study uh as
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh suggested uh
 
05:47:53.708 --> 05:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
where we would you know in this
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
committee figure out what the next steps
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
are um I think that
 
05:48:04.070 --> 05:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh the um it's the fact that we don't
 
05:48:09.110 --> 05:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
have uh Buy in from industry on this yet
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
means that it's not going to as as as it
 
05:48:14.468 --> 05:48:14.478 align:start position:0%
is currently written it's not going to
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
go it's not going to be effective
 
05:48:18.708 --> 05:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
because the only way you can do epr
 
05:48:20.868 --> 05:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
successfully is if you do have industry
 
05:48:23.628 --> 05:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
Buy in I
 
05:48:26.788 --> 05:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
agreed representative ger and then
 
05:48:29.590 --> 05:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you madam chair uh I also
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
support interim study because I I I
 
05:48:33.510 --> 05:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
think I want to Second what
 
05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative NAB said which I I think
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
articulated it well I I also just want
 
05:48:39.390 --> 05:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
to on a cautionary note around data we
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
like data when we like it we don't like
 
05:48:42.070 --> 05:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
it when we don't like it right I mean
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
the study the study includes evidence
 
05:48:46.750 --> 05:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
from I think five or six provinces in
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
Canada which shows that there is no
 
05:48:51.910 --> 05:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
correlation discovered between epr
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
policies and cost right so we don't like
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
it because it's Canada right well if
 
05:48:57.190 --> 05:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's California maybe we don't like it
 
05:48:59.110 --> 05:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
because it's California right
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh well but again we there is data that
 
05:49:05.510 --> 05:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the study was basing uh the its
 
05:49:07.350 --> 05:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion that this is not going to to
 
05:49:09.150 --> 05:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
provide a cost shift there is data for
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
that so it's not as if we don't have
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
data so I just wanted to put that there
 
05:49:13.628 --> 05:49:13.638 align:start position:0%
as a cautionary note right if we're
 
05:49:16.750 --> 05:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to say that there is no data when
 
05:49:18.910 --> 05:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
there is data that concerns me that
 
05:49:22.110 --> 05:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're choosing which data we see
 
05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
as worthy of acknowledging and which we
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh choose to set aside representative
 
05:49:27.760 --> 05:49:30.310 align:start position:0%
uh choose to set aside representative
Penza

05:49:30.310 --> 05:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
Penza
 
05:49:33.628 --> 05:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
wow I have to go after that just kidding
 
05:49:33.638 --> 05:49:35.590 align:start position:0%
wow I have to go after that just kidding
um

05:49:35.590 --> 05:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:38.310 --> 05:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
so I just you know I'm not sure if the
 
05:49:41.270 --> 05:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
study committee um um you were part of
 
05:49:44.510 --> 05:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
that correct okay so during that study
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
05:49:49.708 --> 05:49:49.718 align:start position:0%
what you weren't happy with kind of the
 
05:49:52.510 --> 05:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
results it didn't seem to right
 
05:49:56.350 --> 05:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
correct okay so I just don't understand
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
why the representatives that are um that
 
05:50:03.548 --> 05:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
are proponents of this haven't gone to
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
these were my kind of questions haven't
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
gone to our federal delegation because I
 
05:50:10.868 --> 05:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
believe that that's where this starts I
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
mean if if you want industry buyin you
 
05:50:15.468 --> 05:50:15.478 align:start position:0%
need to have that on such a you have to
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
have that on a national level which then
 
05:50:20.788 --> 05:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
will equate down to a local level I
 
05:50:23.948 --> 05:50:23.958 align:start position:0%
agree with we need to have with with the
 
05:50:25.990 --> 05:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
source with what representative has
 
05:50:28.628 --> 05:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
Haskins said but why aren't we why and
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
our representativ reaching out to our
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
federal delegation to try did you guys
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
talk about that at all in your study
 
05:50:38.830 --> 05:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee it was very limited uh again
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
4day study committee uh and
 
05:50:46.548 --> 05:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
so again what we what we talked about
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
was very limited uh again we didn't look
 
05:50:51.868 --> 05:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
in any state statute a particular State
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
Statute and analyze it word by word uh
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:50:59.190 align:start position:0%
and so
it's

05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
yeah that's pretty much representative
 
05:51:05.430 --> 05:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
kulan thanks for taking my question so
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
there is actually there's conflicting
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
studies and data and evidence on this
 
05:51:14.670 --> 05:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
subject even um you know
 
05:51:17.830 --> 05:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
institutional uh sources that support
 
05:51:20.948 --> 05:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
epr do say that it is a natural
 
05:51:23.708 --> 05:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
byproduct of epr policies that it does
 
05:51:26.910 --> 05:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
affect prices and price increases will
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
be put on to the the consumers and I'm H
 
05:51:33.150 --> 05:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to forward it to you guys
 
05:51:35.590 --> 05:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
and another point is that uh with the
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
issue of out estate waste and Source
 
05:51:40.830 --> 05:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
reduction we would need Massachusetts to
 
05:51:44.548 --> 05:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
pass epr policies to cut down on if
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
there's 50% of ways coming from Mass we
 
05:51:49.830 --> 05:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
need them to sign on to epr too they do
 
05:51:49.840 --> 05:51:50.948 align:start position:0%
need them to sign on to epr too they do
have

05:51:50.948 --> 05:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:51:53.830 --> 05:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
epr I'm sorry but Massachusetts has a
 
05:51:56.190 --> 05:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
bottle bill which is the foundation of
 
05:51:59.548 --> 05:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
epr so I mean I don't know why you you
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
know and it has nothing to do with epr
 
05:52:04.150 --> 05:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
their trash coming into Hampshire is
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they're passing restrictive laws
 
05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
and closing landfills has nothing to do
 
05:52:08.400 --> 05:52:15.788 align:start position:0%
and closing landfills has nothing to do
with

05:52:15.788 --> 05:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
epr uh let's
 
05:52:21.830 --> 05:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh a little decorum
 
05:52:25.548 --> 05:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
Howard I think the bill is
 
05:52:31.150 --> 05:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
I think the bill before us is is
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
actually like three or four bills so um
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
what I want to say two things about
 
05:52:39.310 --> 05:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
about the the um the subject one of them
 
05:52:40.750 --> 05:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
is that we sort of need to treat this
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
like a super fun cleanup you know that
 
05:52:44.910 --> 05:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
where where the the industry takes
 
05:52:47.150 --> 05:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility and and the other thing
 
05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that I want to say is we need to make a
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
commitment to this as a committee what
 
05:52:53.830 --> 05:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do we need to be
 
05:52:56.270 --> 05:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
behind it and and make a strong
 
05:53:03.030 --> 05:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.040 --> 05:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:09.150 --> 05:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
kraton yes ma'am so I'm just trying to
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
to dig off and perhaps um representative
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
basally help me out here so intern an an
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
interim study comes back to the
 
05:53:20.270 --> 05:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee whereas if you send it to a
 
05:53:23.310 --> 05:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee then that is it could be an
 
05:53:25.350 --> 05:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
established subcommittee or one that we
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
propose but those members in there would
 
05:53:32.190 --> 05:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
include members of Industry members of
 
05:53:34.948 --> 05:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
nonprofits members of different agencies
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
involved okay that's a study all right
 
05:53:39.350 --> 05:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
so okay that's okay a study committee
 
05:53:42.030 --> 05:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
but not interim study so there are there
 
05:53:45.310 --> 05:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
are several different ways of studying
 
05:53:49.430 --> 05:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
things interim study is within the uh
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
policy committee a study committee is
 
05:53:55.788 --> 05:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
within the legislature so it's just
 
05:53:58.590 --> 05:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
House and Senate members uh and and
 
05:54:02.190 --> 05:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
those members have the power to uh call
 
05:54:05.070 --> 05:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
witnesses from wherever and uh the
 
05:54:07.468 --> 05:54:07.478 align:start position:0%
witnesses can either say yes or no will
 
05:54:12.070 --> 05:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
come uh and then a a commission is uh
 
05:54:15.590 --> 05:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature plus uh
 
05:54:18.270 --> 05:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from Beyond the legislature
 
05:54:21.990 --> 05:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
and those stakeholders are appointed by
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
Often by the governor sometimes by other
 
05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
bodies that they represent or or
 
05:54:29.430 --> 05:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
recommend Ed to the governor by bodies
 
05:54:34.070 --> 05:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
they represent um in terms of the ease
 
05:54:38.150 --> 05:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
of Passage uh an interim study is the
 
05:54:41.788 --> 05:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
easiest thing to pass and then you get
 
05:54:44.110 --> 05:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
and then a study committee is the next
 
05:54:47.750 --> 05:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
step and then it's much harder to pass a
 
05:54:52.110 --> 05:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
stud a commission uh because there is uh
 
05:54:55.788 --> 05:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
and in terms of ease of running it's
 
05:55:00.150 --> 05:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
probably uh some the interim study and
 
05:55:02.750 --> 05:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
the uh study committee are probably
 
05:55:04.670 --> 05:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
similar in terms of the ease of running
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
it a commission is more complicated to
 
05:55:08.468 --> 05:55:08.478 align:start position:0%
run because you're coordinating more
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
people from more places uh you uh do
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
have the advantage of having those
 
05:55:18.468 --> 05:55:18.478 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in the room with the
 
05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh and uh so um generally if
 
05:55:27.190 --> 05:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a fairly
 
05:55:27.200 --> 05:55:28.310 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a fairly
broad-reaching

05:55:28.310 --> 05:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
broad-reaching
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
complicated problem uh then a commission
 
05:55:34.628 --> 05:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
might be more suited towards it uh if
 
05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
you're looking for looking at something
 
05:55:40.390 --> 05:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
that is uh you're trying to figure out
 
05:55:43.150 --> 05:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of legislation in
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
fact an interim study might be better uh
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
an interim study if we want to make sure
 
05:55:51.510 --> 05:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
it happens an interim study is the is
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
probably the best bet because if we make
 
05:55:55.948 --> 05:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
it into a study bill uh a study
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee the Senate May say not so much
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
and then it goes away it doesn't
 
05:56:05.948 --> 05:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
happen Okay thank you representative
 
05:56:08.750 --> 05:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
chair so in listening to this and in
 
05:56:14.948 --> 05:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
listening to the uh represent brard talk
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
about how they couldn't get the
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
producers to come to testify in front of
 
05:56:22.030 --> 05:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
their committee but yet we have
 
05:56:23.910 --> 05:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
producers sitting on the solid waste
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
working group
 
05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
already I would think that that would be
 
05:56:31.190 --> 05:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
the more pertinent Avenue to take um and
 
05:56:33.070 --> 05:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
asking them to do it because you already
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
have the stakeholders on the in the
 
05:56:39.030 --> 05:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
group and can be there to readily answer
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
any questions and it also is part of
 
05:56:44.910 --> 05:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
what their goal is that's my personal
 
05:56:50.270 --> 05:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um I just
 
05:56:55.628 --> 05:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
want to be clear um we do have to decide
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
on a disposition for this bill so if
 
05:57:02.190 --> 05:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to say
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that may be the desire of
 
05:57:06.750 --> 05:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
individuals to have swag take it up but
 
05:57:08.788 --> 05:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
we don't have the authority to ask them
 
05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
to take it up is that correct right and
 
05:57:12.600 --> 05:57:14.628 align:start position:0%
to take it up is that correct right and
so

05:57:14.628 --> 05:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:18.590 --> 05:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
um but what I think I so I think but to
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
my point I think interim study would
 
05:57:22.510 --> 05:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
give us the best possible opportunity to
 
05:57:25.070 --> 05:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
be able to take a look at what is before
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
us and kind of parse out what is
 
05:57:29.990 --> 05:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
implement able in the short-term medium
 
05:57:32.590 --> 05:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
longterm of this very complex D Bill and
 
05:57:34.110 --> 05:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
get some additional input like
 
05:57:36.590 --> 05:57:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby was mentioning
 
05:57:39.430 --> 05:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby so there was one other
 
05:57:40.868 --> 05:57:40.878 align:start position:0%
thing that I had mentioned earlier was
 
05:57:46.390 --> 05:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
the possibility of um rewriting it to uh
 
05:57:51.110 --> 05:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
be a um uh a feas was the term I Ed
 
05:57:53.310 --> 05:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
needs assess a feasibility assessment or
 
05:57:56.670 --> 05:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
needs assessment and uh I was wondering
 
05:57:58.990 --> 05:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
if I we could ask representative partial
 
05:58:01.830 --> 05:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
if that is an amendment that he would be
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
willing to try to put together in the
 
05:58:06.510 --> 05:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
next couple of
 
05:58:12.270 --> 05:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
weeks um okay um just briefly yeah I
 
05:58:13.628 --> 05:58:13.638 align:start position:0%
will try to be deef and I want to thank
 
05:58:17.590 --> 05:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
you um I would tend to agree that I
 
05:58:19.390 --> 05:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
think one of the real stumbling blocks
 
05:58:22.150 --> 05:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
with this right now and there are a few
 
05:58:24.150 --> 05:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
one of them is the
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh assessment by the DS uh the needs
 
05:58:29.070 --> 05:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
assessment and I think that that would
 
05:58:31.468 --> 05:58:31.478 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate place to try to see if
 
05:58:33.990 --> 05:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
we can move that uh stumbling block as
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
it were with an amendment to the bill
 
05:58:39.708 --> 05:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
that focuses really just on that aspect
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
of it um I I would be more than willing
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
to draft something got effect and uh
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
then at the same time I do have to agree
 
05:58:50.468 --> 05:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
with uh representative brard four days
 
05:58:52.390 --> 05:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
really wasn't enough time and I would
 
05:58:54.868 --> 05:58:54.878 align:start position:0%
also remind the committee that
 
05:58:57.070 --> 05:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
originally this bill the bill that was
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this legislation came
 
05:59:02.110 --> 05:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
before us requesting a study
 
05:59:05.390 --> 05:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
commission and upon the I think in the
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
retrospect the sage advice of this group
 
05:59:09.310 --> 05:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
we did reduce that to a committee rather
 
05:59:09.320 --> 05:59:10.070 align:start position:0%
we did reduce that to a committee rather
than

05:59:10.070 --> 05:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:59:12.430 --> 05:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
commission um I don't know if they would
 
05:59:15.628 --> 05:59:15.638 align:start position:0%
be willing to take a second committee on
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
last point I'm sorry I'm going on here
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
uh at the time the uh Solid Waste uh uh
 
05:59:25.190 --> 05:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
commission was in here they
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
expressed not a lot of not a lot lot of
 
05:59:30.868 --> 05:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
they they they really like the idea of
 
05:59:32.990 --> 05:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
epr but they were questioning whether or
 
05:59:34.390 --> 05:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
not they were the appropriate Avenue of
 
05:59:36.750 --> 05:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
it at that time if you remember they
 
05:59:39.310 --> 05:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
said they thought this legislation was
 
05:59:40.910 --> 05:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
of the nature that really needs to be
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
its own have its own life independent of
 
05:59:46.670 --> 05:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
their Solid Waste committee um just a
 
05:59:48.948 --> 05:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
reminder on those little couple
 
05:59:51.868 --> 05:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
points and and again toer right yes I
 
05:59:53.350 --> 05:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to do whatever
 
05:59:53.360 --> 05:59:56.548 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to do whatever
it

05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
takes so would
 
06:00:03.070 --> 06:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh would the committee be amenable to
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
this bill um being replaced totally with
 
06:00:11.868 --> 06:00:11.878 align:start position:0%
just uh a more brief
 
06:00:11.878 --> 06:00:13.868 align:start position:0%
just uh a more brief
uh

06:00:13.868 --> 06:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
request for Dees to do A needs
 
06:00:22.150 --> 06:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
assessment or I mean I mean other than
 
06:00:24.510 --> 06:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
that you know I would suggest and I
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
think we all are on the same page of of
 
06:00:30.030 --> 06:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to do do something um to achieve
 
06:00:33.788 --> 06:00:33.798 align:start position:0%
the goal of not only what Dees is
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
looking for but also what the solid
 
06:00:38.510 --> 06:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
waste working group is looking for and
 
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
what this committee has also said in
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
terms of wanting to seek ways in which
 
06:00:45.628 --> 06:00:45.638 align:start position:0%
we can
 
06:00:50.070 --> 06:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh address the issue of need of um of
 
06:00:50.080 --> 06:00:51.070 align:start position:0%
uh address the issue of need of um of
waste

06:00:51.070 --> 06:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
waste
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
reduction um so I mean I might even you
 
06:00:58.510 --> 06:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
know entertain the idea of just itl the
 
06:01:01.628 --> 06:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
bill and then request to send a letter
 
06:01:04.350 --> 06:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
from this committee to Solid Waste
 
06:01:08.590 --> 06:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
working group saying hey this was Sample
 
06:01:11.788 --> 06:01:11.798 align:start position:0%
legislation would your committee
 
06:01:15.788 --> 06:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
consider looking into this issue and
 
06:01:19.628 --> 06:01:19.638 align:start position:0%
making some suggestions for future
 
06:01:22.510 --> 06:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
legislation representative BL brard I'd
 
06:01:23.868 --> 06:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
certainly be in favor of that Madam
 
06:01:26.430 --> 06:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
chair I think it's a brilliant
 
06:01:26.440 --> 06:01:28.750 align:start position:0%
chair I think it's a brilliant
idea

06:01:28.750 --> 06:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
idea
 
06:01:31.150 --> 06:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative Duty uh yeah I would be
 
06:01:33.868 --> 06:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
totally against that uh first of all if
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
we do A needs assessment and we uh send
 
06:01:38.070 --> 06:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
it over to Dees the first thing they're
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to come back is saying it's going
 
06:01:41.468 --> 06:01:41.478 align:start position:0%
to cost us
 
06:01:43.390 --> 06:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and where are we going to get
 
06:01:44.990 --> 06:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
the money so everything is going to be
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
dead in the water my preference is for
 
06:01:49.270 --> 06:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh inter room
 
06:01:52.270 --> 06:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
study representative Howard I just have
 
06:01:54.990 --> 06:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
a question if we give it to the uh Solid
 
06:01:57.468 --> 06:01:57.478 align:start position:0%
Waste committee um will we get it back
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
or do they
 
06:02:00.240 --> 06:02:02.190 align:start position:0%
or do they
they

06:02:02.190 --> 06:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
they they
 
06:02:07.468 --> 06:02:07.478 align:start position:0%
would no the solid waste working group
 
06:02:10.070 --> 06:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
would then consider this as something
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
for them to to take on and to take a
 
06:02:14.350 --> 06:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
look at I mean I can't speak for
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative eel or what plans she has
 
06:02:19.830 --> 06:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
for 2024 and what they're studying and
 
06:02:22.390 --> 06:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
looking at but certainly if we can give
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
them something to start with uh and and
 
06:02:29.350 --> 06:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
they can discuss it amongst um both the
 
06:02:31.230 --> 06:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
representative from Dees representative
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
from the Senate all the producers and
 
06:02:36.628 --> 06:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
and solid waste haulers and other people
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
that at least there's more input into
 
06:02:42.910 --> 06:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
that process than there would be in an
 
06:02:46.030 --> 06:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
interim study um
 
06:02:49.070 --> 06:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
and you know that would be something
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:55.830 --> 06:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
at representative Bixby yeah so before
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
we say we're going to kick it over Solid
 
06:03:00.868 --> 06:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
Waste working group uh we should make
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
sure that there's someone who there that
 
06:03:07.230 --> 06:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
they actually want to receive it uh and
 
06:03:11.430 --> 06:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
I think that um another possibility is
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we could do an interim study on
 
06:03:17.150 --> 06:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
this and we could in uh involve the
 
06:03:20.230 --> 06:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group as one of our
 
06:03:23.548 --> 06:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.788 --> 06:03:28.798 align:start position:0%
expertise okay any other comments
 
06:03:31.230 --> 06:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
okay I think uh we are done talking
 
06:03:31.240 --> 06:03:32.350 align:start position:0%
okay I think uh we are done talking
about

06:03:32.350 --> 06:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
16:30 and we can move on to HB
 
06:03:38.590 --> 06:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
11184 and I want to thank the committee
 
06:03:41.310 --> 06:03:41.320 align:start position:0%
members for um all of your attention on
 
06:03:43.468 --> 06:03:43.478 align:start position:0%
all of these bills as the hour is
 
06:03:47.270 --> 06:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
getting late um we've got some real good
 
06:03:49.788 --> 06:03:49.798 align:start position:0%
conversation going on and I appreciate
 
06:03:53.070 --> 06:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
that uh hb1 1184 relative to making an
 
06:03:54.750 --> 06:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation to The Organic
 
06:03:54.760 --> 06:03:56.190 align:start position:0%
appropriation to The Organic
certification

06:03:56.190 --> 06:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
certification
 
06:03:56.200 --> 06:04:02.310 align:start position:0%
certification
program

06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.670 --> 06:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
um okay on one hand I think I don't
 
06:04:15.310 --> 06:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
think there's a member on this committee
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
that is unfriendly or against our
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
organic farmers in this state I think
 
06:04:27.310 --> 06:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
that um we all support organic gardening
 
06:04:30.948 --> 06:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
and organic farming organic
 
06:04:34.110 --> 06:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
produce uh I do think that we have some
 
06:04:35.350 --> 06:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
differences of
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
opinion of um what that support should
 
06:04:39.240 --> 06:04:40.548 align:start position:0%
opinion of um what that support should
look

06:04:40.548 --> 06:04:40.558 align:start position:0%
look
 
06:04:40.558 --> 06:04:43.590 align:start position:0%
look
like

06:04:43.590 --> 06:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
um I know from testimony from um
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper from
 
06:04:55.030 --> 06:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
agriculture he doesn't believe this bill
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
if it if it wasn't passed that it would
 
06:04:58.990 --> 06:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
harm New Hampshire
 
06:04:59.000 --> 06:05:02.270 align:start position:0%
harm New Hampshire
farming

06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:07.350 --> 06:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
um he also said that people can put New
 
06:05:09.948 --> 06:05:09.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Gran on their packaging if
 
06:05:12.468 --> 06:05:12.478 align:start position:0%
they were to get certified in some other
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
place other than from the New Hampshire
 
06:05:14.798 --> 06:05:16.670 align:start position:0%
place other than from the New Hampshire
agriculture

06:05:16.670 --> 06:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
06:05:20.788 --> 06:05:20.798 align:start position:0%
Department he said that the fees
 
06:05:24.310 --> 06:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
alone would not be able to support this
 
06:05:28.230 --> 06:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
program even if they were to continue
 
06:05:30.468 --> 06:05:30.478 align:start position:0%
uh with I guess the appropriation that
 
06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
they were looking for was an additional
 
06:05:33.360 --> 06:05:34.788 align:start position:0%
they were looking for was an additional
additional

06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
additional
 
06:05:38.868 --> 06:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
$220,000 for this year for this
 
06:05:41.670 --> 06:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
year um they already have three people
 
06:05:46.190 --> 06:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
doing this the problem is that um I
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
guess with
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
the commission that he's the advisory
 
06:05:54.468 --> 06:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
Council that he has been working with
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
has said to him that this program needs
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
to be funded more
 
06:06:04.430 --> 06:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
robustly if they were to continue doing
 
06:06:08.190 --> 06:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
it um we have 4,000
 
06:06:14.788 --> 06:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
Farms 66 of them are uh certified in
 
06:06:19.628 --> 06:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
state and um I guess we are one of 12
 
06:06:24.910 --> 06:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
states that have an uh an
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
organic uh state
 
06:06:28.638 --> 06:06:31.310 align:start position:0%
organic uh state
program

06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
um the people who want to continue this
 
06:06:38.430 --> 06:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
program mentioned that they have a
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
familiarity with our
 
06:06:43.070 --> 06:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
inspectors Department of Agriculture is
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with New Hampshire Farm issues
 
06:06:47.628 --> 06:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire should support its New
 
06:06:49.350 --> 06:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire organic
 
06:06:54.430 --> 06:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
farmers so given that I think that uh we
 
06:06:56.350 --> 06:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
can start some discussion about this
 
06:06:58.990 --> 06:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
particular B representative
 
06:07:02.350 --> 06:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah I I what you said I think is
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
is really true I mean I think we all
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to support the organic farmers and
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'm you know in up in the air about this
 
06:07:11.270 --> 06:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I I do see it as a marketing
 
06:07:13.270 --> 06:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
program but I do think that it's
 
06:07:16.310 --> 06:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
important what about the possibility
 
06:07:18.270 --> 06:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to throw it out again of
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
maybe doing an interim study and working
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
with our federal delegation to see if
 
06:07:28.030 --> 06:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
there's any funding program
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
that uh would be available for let's say
 
06:07:33.628 --> 06:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
the next 5 years uh to be able to fund
 
06:07:37.708 --> 06:07:37.718 align:start position:0%
it um I I don't know I mean you know I
 
06:07:40.270 --> 06:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's hard to take money from
 
06:07:42.750 --> 06:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund for a small slice of
 
06:07:45.270 --> 06:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
Farmers on the other hand I just don't
 
06:07:47.230 --> 06:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
want to leave them high and dry so I'll
 
06:07:50.708 --> 06:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
throw that out representative ktoa thank
 
06:07:51.868 --> 06:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
06:07:54.910 --> 06:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
chair um as the commissioner said they
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be left high and dry you know
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
the misnomer that he left the dairy and
 
06:08:03.390 --> 06:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
the meat uh Farmers high and dry was was
 
06:08:06.670 --> 06:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
false um they chose not to they had you
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
know over six months we also know that
 
06:08:13.350 --> 06:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
there's substantial number of Organic
 
06:08:16.030 --> 06:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
Crop Farmers that are being certified
 
06:08:17.430 --> 06:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
not by the
 
06:08:19.708 --> 06:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
state we also
 
06:08:19.718 --> 06:08:21.230 align:start position:0%
state we also
know

06:08:21.230 --> 06:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:08:25.670 --> 06:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
that through the USDA they can recoup up
 
06:08:29.230 --> 06:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
to 75% % of the fees that it cost them
 
06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
to be organ organic up to
 
06:08:36.628 --> 06:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
$750 and as you know that was stated the
 
06:08:38.750 --> 06:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
cost for some was $900 and the other
 
06:08:41.150 --> 06:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
cost was
 
06:08:43.750 --> 06:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
$1,400 they have not seen a fee increase
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
in this state and they were paying $300
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
to be certified so if you take
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
300 and 75% of $1,400 it might cost them
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
another $100 or $200 is to be certified
 
06:08:57.718 --> 06:08:59.230 align:start position:0%
another $100 or $200 is to be certified
by

06:08:59.230 --> 06:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
mafka the other thing is is that
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
top which is USDA organic transition is
 
06:09:11.670 --> 06:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
GI working with Farmers with a $100
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
million grant program already for
 
06:09:14.798 --> 06:09:17.190 align:start position:0%
million grant program already for
organic

06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
organic
 
06:09:19.510 --> 06:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
farming my personal
 
06:09:23.230 --> 06:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
opinion is that they need to either
 
06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
self- sustain this
 
06:09:27.948 --> 06:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
program because we should shouldn't be
 
06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
favoring less than 2% of
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:38.910 --> 06:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
else representative NAB thank you madam
 
06:09:41.230 --> 06:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
chair um you know it's I know I've only
 
06:09:42.510 --> 06:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
been on this committee for a year but
 
06:09:44.510 --> 06:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's my feeling that we are very
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of farmers unless US unless
 
06:09:50.110 --> 06:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
it costs us any money so I I just want
 
06:09:51.990 --> 06:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
to be and I understand that we're trying
 
06:09:53.510 --> 06:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
to be fiscally conservative but I also
 
06:09:55.390 --> 06:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
want to be really careful and say no to
 
06:09:57.910 --> 06:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
supporting this um and it so I'll say
 
06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
that and I'll also point out that
 
06:10:02.150 --> 06:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
organic farmers it's not just marketing
 
06:10:04.030 --> 06:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
like organic farming is better for the
 
06:10:05.948 --> 06:10:05.958 align:start position:0%
soil it's better for our insect
 
06:10:07.468 --> 06:10:07.478 align:start position:0%
populations it's better for our bird
 
06:10:08.708 --> 06:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
populations it's better for our
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
consumers there are pieces of it that
 
06:10:12.548 --> 06:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
are better as a whole for our state and
 
06:10:14.468 --> 06:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
for our constituents that are not it's
 
06:10:15.788 --> 06:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
not just better for the farmers you know
 
06:10:17.548 --> 06:10:17.558 align:start position:0%
it's not just we're not just doing this
 
06:10:19.590 --> 06:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the organic farmers I think it it
 
06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
plays a much bigger role in our
 
06:10:21.990 --> 06:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
environment I think it's important to
 
06:10:23.150 --> 06:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
remember that when we're thinking about
 
06:10:25.510 --> 06:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
this so I take everything that the chair
 
06:10:27.628 --> 06:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
said I I totally agree that it's a
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
complicated issue but um I just wanted
 
06:10:32.510 --> 06:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
to say those two points thank you
 
06:10:32.520 --> 06:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
to say those two points thank you
representative

06:10:33.910 --> 06:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
Howard I thought one of the uh
 
06:10:38.868 --> 06:10:38.878 align:start position:0%
interesting testimonies was that um many
 
06:10:40.590 --> 06:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
organic farmers were going outside the
 
06:10:42.670 --> 06:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
state to get their to get their
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
certification and um it seems sort of
 
06:10:47.150 --> 06:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
like a viable option to me and I I sort
 
06:10:49.150 --> 06:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
of could picture things with you know
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
certified organic and grown in you know
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
two different stickers side by side um
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
because I I think the sticker price on
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:02.670 --> 06:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
high representative Bixby did you have a
 
06:11:04.868 --> 06:11:04.878 align:start position:0%
comment yeah so
 
06:11:07.230 --> 06:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
um my
 
06:11:12.430 --> 06:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
my my feeling about this is that uh this
 
06:11:17.468 --> 06:11:17.478 align:start position:0%
is something that uh would be so the the
 
06:11:20.190 --> 06:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriation on this I think is
 
06:11:22.548 --> 06:11:22.558 align:start position:0%
essential I see it as Bridge funding so
 
06:11:26.910 --> 06:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
that the um the depart the program in
 
06:11:30.230 --> 06:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
the department can continue long enough
 
06:11:35.350 --> 06:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
to provide a solid basis for the for the
 
06:11:37.750 --> 06:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh for the farmers who are now in that
 
06:11:42.110 --> 06:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
program so that a um a more robust
 
06:11:44.270 --> 06:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
program can be worked out in the next
 
06:11:48.150 --> 06:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
couple of years uh at this point uh
 
06:11:49.910 --> 06:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
there have been some attempts to figure
 
06:11:53.670 --> 06:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
out a way to get a uh a satellite
 
06:11:57.390 --> 06:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
program using uh
 
06:11:59.468 --> 06:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
with with essentially a New Hampshire
 
06:12:04.830 --> 06:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
base but having a third party uh um
 
06:12:10.230 --> 06:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
certifier be the um be the the uh Point
 
06:12:12.110 --> 06:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
organization with the
 
06:12:17.310 --> 06:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
USDA uh and that process is still very
 
06:12:21.310 --> 06:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
much in um in the discussion phase it is
 
06:12:23.468 --> 06:12:23.478 align:start position:0%
they don't have a solid commitment from
 
06:12:26.430 --> 06:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
another uh certifier yet that would say
 
06:12:29.430 --> 06:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
say that would be possible uh so it's
 
06:12:31.150 --> 06:12:31.160 align:start position:0%
something that they're still exploring
 
06:12:35.270 --> 06:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
it would it also requires on NOA to get
 
06:12:39.350 --> 06:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
a uh to spin off a separate uh LLC
 
06:12:41.948 --> 06:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
because under USDA
 
06:12:45.788 --> 06:12:45.798 align:start position:0%
rules uh the NOA would as as an advising
 
06:12:49.390 --> 06:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
organization cannot be the certifying
 
06:12:52.990 --> 06:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
organization so uh there's a lot of
 
06:12:55.750 --> 06:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work in terms of uh
 
06:12:58.590 --> 06:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
trying to hammer out an agreement that
 
06:13:01.868 --> 06:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
will be best for New Hampshire's organic
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
farmers uh it's not going to gel in the
 
06:13:07.070 --> 06:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
next six months and I think what what
 
06:13:09.788 --> 06:13:09.798 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it really
 
06:13:14.030 --> 06:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
buys another year for NOA and the
 
06:13:17.548 --> 06:13:17.558 align:start position:0%
department and uh other reg Regional
 
06:13:20.190 --> 06:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
organizer or certifying organizations
 
06:13:23.468 --> 06:13:23.478 align:start position:0%
who might be able to cooperate with NOA
 
06:13:26.750 --> 06:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
to create us a more solid working plan
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby if I recall
 
06:13:30.830 --> 06:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner said that he would continue
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
this program till the end of the year if
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
we did not pass this legislation yes
 
06:13:39.468 --> 06:13:39.478 align:start position:0%
that gives us so that gives us to the
 
06:13:42.468 --> 06:13:42.478 align:start position:0%
end of this growing season uh which
 
06:13:45.750 --> 06:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
still is a very tight timeline for what
 
06:13:47.830 --> 06:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh no is trying to pull together in
 
06:13:52.270 --> 06:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
terms of uh creating a satellite program
 
06:13:56.708 --> 06:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that uh fund Prov in this
 
06:14:00.110 --> 06:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
funding for the Department to uh which
 
06:14:01.788 --> 06:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
would be supplemented by fees and their
 
06:14:04.868 --> 06:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
fees are going to increase uh in the
 
06:14:10.070 --> 06:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
next for the 25 growing season uh that
 
06:14:14.468 --> 06:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
will um I think uh give no for the the
 
06:14:18.070 --> 06:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
time to pull together a a more solid uh
 
06:14:21.750 --> 06:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
plan uh for the future going forward
 
06:14:21.760 --> 06:14:23.390 align:start position:0%
plan uh for the future going forward
representative

06:14:23.390 --> 06:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:14:25.990 --> 06:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
smart yeah I just wanted to speak to the
 
06:14:29.590 --> 06:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
point point of organic farmers are
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
better for the soil and better for the
 
06:14:36.270 --> 06:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
environment than regular Farmers um our
 
06:14:40.110 --> 06:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
soil and our land is our job security
 
06:14:42.270 --> 06:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
and we have regulations that we have to
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
follow as Farmers whether we're organic
 
06:14:49.788 --> 06:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
certified or not and um no I don't know
 
06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
any farmer who wants to go out of his
 
06:14:51.600 --> 06:14:53.270 align:start position:0%
any farmer who wants to go out of his
way

06:14:53.270 --> 06:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:14:58.350 --> 06:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
to do damage to his crops or his soil or
 
06:15:02.270 --> 06:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
his animals or anything to that effect
 
06:15:05.070 --> 06:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
just because he doesn't have a
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
USDA um certified organic farmer in New
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire signed to put on his food as
 
06:15:16.868 --> 06:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell what I see is they get
 
06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
more money for their produce um but that
 
06:15:21.788 --> 06:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean they had better
 
06:15:23.390 --> 06:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
practices for their
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:31.590 --> 06:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
now I forgot what I was gonna say okay
 
06:15:34.230 --> 06:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
well we'll go to representative ger then
 
06:15:37.230 --> 06:15:37.240 align:start position:0%
and when you when you remember let me
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
know thank you madam chair I apologize I
 
06:15:40.868 --> 06:15:40.878 align:start position:0%
just step out for a moment at the
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
beginning of this conversation but I
 
06:15:43.750 --> 06:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate a point I made
 
06:15:45.230 --> 06:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
during the hearing which is I I hope
 
06:15:47.548 --> 06:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
that the fee structure will will be
 
06:15:49.430 --> 06:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
Revisited it seemed to me that was an
 
06:15:51.548 --> 06:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
issue too if if they're going by the
 
06:15:54.190 --> 06:15:54.200 align:start position:0%
income of the farmer right now going
 
06:15:56.150 --> 06:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
right on the S so the number of Acres
 
06:15:57.868 --> 06:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't correspond to the
 
06:16:00.190 --> 06:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
income of the farmer so I just hope that
 
06:16:02.150 --> 06:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
as a part of whatever solution we end up
 
06:16:04.510 --> 06:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
with that that that fee structure gets
 
06:16:07.628 --> 06:16:07.638 align:start position:0%
Revisited so that is the fee structure
 
06:16:12.350 --> 06:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
and the the authorization to uh work out
 
06:16:13.750 --> 06:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
the fee structure is something that is
 
06:16:16.510 --> 06:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
in current law and uh that's something
 
06:16:18.910 --> 06:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's not really part of this
 
06:16:21.230 --> 06:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill yeah I no I understand that I just
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to say I wanted to put that out
 
06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
there because I don't think whatever
 
06:16:26.468 --> 06:16:26.478 align:start position:0%
solution we end up with is is going to
 
06:16:29.230 --> 06:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
be satisfactory unless we also address
 
06:16:31.788 --> 06:16:31.798 align:start position:0%
the issues with the fee structures it
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
exists thank you representative Penza
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay I remember now um so to the point
 
06:16:40.868 --> 06:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
that representative Bixby made in
 
06:16:44.030 --> 06:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
regards with NOA so they would have to
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh if you can clarify they would have to
 
06:16:49.150 --> 06:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
like break off or do something as a
 
06:16:53.670 --> 06:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
separate entity to be able to um be a
 
06:16:58.030 --> 06:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
certifier yes so under USDA organic
 
06:17:00.270 --> 06:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
rules the
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
organization that provides advice and
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
advocacy uh for uh organic farmers
 
06:17:10.030 --> 06:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be the same organization that
 
06:17:13.430 --> 06:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
certifies so mafka actually is two
 
06:17:15.190 --> 06:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
different branches there's the main
 
06:17:16.510 --> 06:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
organic farmers and gardeners
 
06:17:20.750 --> 06:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
Association which does uh advising and
 
06:17:24.390 --> 06:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
does advocacy and uh education stuff and
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
then there's mafa certif certification
 
06:17:29.110 --> 06:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
Services which is a separate
 
06:17:33.310 --> 06:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
LLC that uh just does the certification
 
06:17:37.390 --> 06:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
and uh there they have entirely separate
 
06:17:40.270 --> 06:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
accounts uh the only support that the
 
06:17:42.270 --> 06:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
certification Services gets from the
 
06:17:46.868 --> 06:17:46.878 align:start position:0%
main organization is that it um they
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
they have some uh workspace available on
 
06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
the the mafka campus that uh that so but
 
06:17:56.670 --> 06:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
other than that they're financially
 
06:17:58.670 --> 06:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
completely separate representative
 
06:18:01.990 --> 06:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
cont thank you madam chair and um
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong representative
 
06:18:08.830 --> 06:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
Bixby but because we're looking at um
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
06:18:14.468 --> 06:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
2025 funding this not this year could
 
06:18:16.750 --> 06:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
that then fall under the budget
 
06:18:20.750 --> 06:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
process uh no it's so 20 fiscal year
 
06:18:25.350 --> 06:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
2025 is within is in this bium and then
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
any future future funding would be under
 
06:18:29.468 --> 06:18:29.478 align:start position:0%
the budget process if that were deemed
 
06:18:29.478 --> 06:18:30.868 align:start position:0%
the budget process if that were deemed
appropriate

06:18:30.868 --> 06:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
06:18:30.878 --> 06:18:34.270 align:start position:0%
appropriate
followup

06:18:34.270 --> 06:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing in this bill to
 
06:18:48.350 --> 06:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:51.390 --> 06:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
sustaining at the same time uh being
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
able to so
 
06:18:58.430 --> 06:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that's uh that's something that we
 
06:19:01.230 --> 06:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
can revisit during the budget process
 
06:19:03.670 --> 06:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
for the next
 
06:19:10.110 --> 06:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:13.510 --> 06:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
06:19:16.230 --> 06:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
um is there any plan for any kind of
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill represent vict I
 
06:19:20.230 --> 06:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
don't plan any amendments I think that
 
06:19:23.910 --> 06:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
it is uh it it it either stands on its
 
06:19:26.628 --> 06:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
merits as it is or it doesn't and U I
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
think that uh that's something that
 
06:19:31.868 --> 06:19:31.878 align:start position:0%
we'll decide on representative K's um
 
06:19:37.110 --> 06:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:41.110 --> 06:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I mean I recall that Rob
 
06:19:44.070 --> 06:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
Johnson from from Farm Bureau had
 
06:19:48.150 --> 06:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um he thought that there
 
06:19:50.190 --> 06:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
should be some sort of sunset provision
 
06:19:53.708 --> 06:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
on the funding uh for the or Organic
 
06:19:55.868 --> 06:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
certification program to give it some
 
06:19:58.230 --> 06:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
time and then if it didn't work out then
 
06:20:00.430 --> 06:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
at least you had a sunset provision okay
 
06:20:03.190 --> 06:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
would you would um I could put together
 
06:20:05.948 --> 06:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
a an amendment I could work with you on
 
06:20:09.150 --> 06:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment to uh for a potential
 
06:20:11.510 --> 06:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
Sunset if you'd be amendable to that
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay well um we'll we'll have to discuss
 
06:20:17.628 --> 06:20:17.638 align:start position:0%
that yeah um but I do know the sentiment
 
06:20:20.590 --> 06:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
of uh some folks on the committee who
 
06:20:23.230 --> 06:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
have said to me that you know if if we
 
06:20:25.708 --> 06:20:25.718 align:start position:0%
already have a mechanism in place where
 
06:20:29.310 --> 06:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
farmers can get certified
 
06:20:32.030 --> 06:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
organic then why would the Department of
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
Agriculture duplicate that effort I mean
 
06:20:36.830 --> 06:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
that that's been the question that's
 
06:20:40.070 --> 06:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
kind of come up yeah I I and I I hear
 
06:20:45.190 --> 06:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
that argument um and uh I also heard a
 
06:20:49.830 --> 06:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
lot of constituents who were very
 
06:20:49.840 --> 06:20:52.430 align:start position:0%
lot of constituents who were very
um

06:20:52.430 --> 06:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:54.628 --> 06:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
very um what's
 
06:20:54.638 --> 06:20:56.750 align:start position:0%
very um what's
it

06:20:56.750 --> 06:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:20:59.390 --> 06:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
very dedicated to having the program
 
06:21:02.430 --> 06:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
continue within the department and uh so
 
06:21:02.440 --> 06:21:03.830 align:start position:0%
continue within the department and uh so
I'm

06:21:03.830 --> 06:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
essentially I said I told them I would
 
06:21:09.150 --> 06:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
repr that represent them in this
 
06:21:11.830 --> 06:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
process and but I wonder though I mean
 
06:21:13.990 --> 06:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
if that meant that the fees on this
 
06:21:16.708 --> 06:21:16.718 align:start position:0%
program would be increased which is
 
06:21:20.230 --> 06:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
probably more likely because of the need
 
06:21:23.030 --> 06:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
to have more income for for this I
 
06:21:26.190 --> 06:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
wonder if there I mean there are only 66
 
06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
Farms right now that are with the
 
06:21:29.990 --> 06:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
current program and the current fee
 
06:21:32.430 --> 06:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
structure and I wonder how many of those
 
06:21:35.230 --> 06:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
would drop off if the fees went
 
06:21:38.270 --> 06:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
up that's a reasonable question uh but I
 
06:21:39.628 --> 06:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
think we're not we're not going to solve
 
06:21:43.510 --> 06:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
it today right represent comto thank you
 
06:21:46.510 --> 06:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I just want to reference
 
06:21:48.350 --> 06:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
the question that you just asked and
 
06:21:50.468 --> 06:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
what we heard from the folks that were
 
06:21:52.270 --> 06:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
testifying is that they would go
 
06:21:55.628 --> 06:21:55.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere else yeah I just represent
 
06:21:57.430 --> 06:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
Craton and then I think we'd be done
 
06:22:00.030 --> 06:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
with this yeah I'm just trying to square
 
06:22:04.670 --> 06:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
um 4,000 people or 4,000 Farms versus 66
 
06:22:06.868 --> 06:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
and why we would be spending
 
06:22:10.590 --> 06:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
$220,000 for 66 Farms just to do
 
06:22:13.110 --> 06:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
something that's already been done and I
 
06:22:17.430 --> 06:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:20.510 --> 06:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
us all right thank you and we're gonna
 
06:22:24.070 --> 06:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
move along to our last bill to uh weigh
 
06:22:28.868 --> 06:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
1618 um which I just received an
 
06:22:31.440 --> 06:22:33.750 align:start position:0%
1618 um which I just received an
amendment

06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:22:37.350 --> 06:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
for um they change it
 
06:22:41.430 --> 06:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
to okay so this is uh what is this
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment do okay so what um the uh this
 
06:22:50.150 --> 06:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
essentially addresses a criticism that
 
06:22:54.310 --> 06:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner had of the um the bill
 
06:22:56.708 --> 06:22:56.718 align:start position:0%
that representative wolf submitted uh
 
06:23:00.390 --> 06:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
and uh the way that it was
 
06:23:03.030 --> 06:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
originally constructed would have
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
required the department to uh cover all
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
four Scopes that in The Organic
 
06:23:11.670 --> 06:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
certification program and that would
 
06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
have been uh actually impossible for the
 
06:23:17.510 --> 06:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
Department to do uh the
 
06:23:20.430 --> 06:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh put together this
 
06:23:23.150 --> 06:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
language for representative wolf as
 
06:23:25.590 --> 06:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
something that uh would in fact be
 
06:23:28.750 --> 06:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
workable if we chose to pass this uh
 
06:23:32.708 --> 06:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
pass the Bill uh and um so essentially
 
06:23:35.910 --> 06:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
what it does is that it would uh require
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
the current uh program uh organic
 
06:23:42.910 --> 06:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
program in the department to continue uh
 
06:23:45.670 --> 06:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
as it is which is just for certifying
 
06:23:50.670 --> 06:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
crops uh and currently uh it's the ter
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
the the word may is in that in uh the
 
06:23:56.990 --> 06:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
commission May which means that the
 
06:23:59.948 --> 06:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the ability to say uh
 
06:24:02.628 --> 06:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
no we can't do this anymore uh this
 
06:24:05.510 --> 06:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
would uh make it a shall which means
 
06:24:07.430 --> 06:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
that only the legislature would be able
 
06:24:11.628 --> 06:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:16.670 --> 06:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
ktoa oh I to you m' oh okay thank you
 
06:24:24.390 --> 06:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair um this bill is almost a
 
06:24:27.310 --> 06:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
duplication of the previous Bill except
 
06:24:30.350 --> 06:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
that it puts it in law and there's
 
06:24:32.070 --> 06:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't talk about self being
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
self-funded at all and again you're
 
06:24:37.510 --> 06:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
talking less than 2% of the Farms would
 
06:24:41.310 --> 06:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
benefit while the rest of us do
 
06:24:45.910 --> 06:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:49.230 --> 06:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
kraton uh yes ma'am I just to be clear
 
06:24:52.190 --> 06:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
and it's really asking the question is
 
06:24:56.070 --> 06:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
is this duplicative of the previous bill
 
06:24:58.708 --> 06:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
number one and number two it what would
 
06:25:01.430 --> 06:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
the the last Financial note on this was
 
06:25:04.310 --> 06:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
800,000 and what is this a quarter of
 
06:25:07.390 --> 06:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
that I don't okay so
 
06:25:10.990 --> 06:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh well you don't get you don't get um
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes on on amendments but but
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
the the the cost to the Department of of
 
06:25:21.190 --> 06:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
this would be uh in the first year the
 
06:25:24.390 --> 06:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
220,000 that is in the previous Bill uh
 
06:25:26.990 --> 06:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
it is a an entirely separate bill from
 
06:25:33.350 --> 06:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
my bill uh and uh so uh I am essentially
 
06:25:36.948 --> 06:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
bringing forth this amendment as uh as a
 
06:25:40.110 --> 06:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
favor for representative wolf um whose
 
06:25:44.070 --> 06:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
Bill the the bill is um
 
06:25:47.670 --> 06:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
and uh he is he is an organic farmer
 
06:25:53.868 --> 06:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
himself and he uh was uh very much he
 
06:25:58.548 --> 06:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
was affected by the loss of the um Pro
 
06:26:02.510 --> 06:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
the handling and animal Scopes in the um
 
06:26:04.868 --> 06:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago when those uh ended
 
06:26:07.548 --> 06:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
up disappearing and he just does doesn't
 
06:26:10.070 --> 06:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
want to have the crop scope disappear
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
again uh so uh in terms of the cost of
 
06:26:21.548 --> 06:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
this it is um it it would be the 220,000
 
06:26:23.270 --> 06:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
the first year and less than that in the
 
06:26:24.750 --> 06:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
following years because there are
 
06:26:28.548 --> 06:26:28.558 align:start position:0%
capital expenses in the um in the that
 
06:26:33.990 --> 06:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
first year fiscal note um and it my it
 
06:26:37.670 --> 06:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
should be considered separately from my
 
06:26:41.110 --> 06:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay for a followup ma'am yep and
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
06:26:45.110 --> 06:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
separately but I thought you just said
 
06:26:47.150 --> 06:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
it was the same two bodies that we were
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
buying for that
 
06:26:54.070 --> 06:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
220,000 so the um there's no there's no
 
06:26:57.510 --> 06:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
difference so there's no if if my bill
 
06:26:59.670 --> 06:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
passes there this bill has absolutely no
 
06:27:04.230 --> 06:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
additional cost to your bill to my bill
 
06:27:07.910 --> 06:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
so uh if my bill if my bill fails and
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill passes then uh the cost would
 
06:27:13.670 --> 06:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
probably be about that about what my
 
06:27:16.788 --> 06:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
bill was okay thank you sir representing
 
06:27:20.230 --> 06:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
com tomor thank you madam chair just to
 
06:27:23.788 --> 06:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
clarify if this bill
 
06:27:26.910 --> 06:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
passes there's no reason to put a sunset
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
into the previous bill because it will
 
06:27:30.958 --> 06:27:34.430 align:start position:0%
into the previous bill because it will
never

06:27:34.430 --> 06:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:37.628 --> 06:27:37.638 align:start position:0%
Sunset that's correct representative H
 
06:27:40.948 --> 06:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair um I'm
 
06:27:44.468 --> 06:27:44.478 align:start position:0%
trying to think about an analogy to why
 
06:27:49.310 --> 06:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
I think Organics are so important I pay
 
06:27:51.990 --> 06:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
for public schools but I sent my kids to
 
06:27:54.430 --> 06:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
private schools I pay for a lot of
 
06:27:56.670 --> 06:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
things I don't live on Great Bay but I
 
06:27:58.910 --> 06:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
care desperately about that body of
 
06:28:03.788 --> 06:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
water so yes Organics cost more yes
 
06:28:07.230 --> 06:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
there are fewer organic farmers by far
 
06:28:09.390 --> 06:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
but they are producing something
 
06:28:13.788 --> 06:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
precious and I believe our our soil our
 
06:28:18.110 --> 06:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
water our air all benefit from that as
 
06:28:21.030 --> 06:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
my colleague um representative NAB said
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
I attest to
 
06:28:25.070 --> 06:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that representative kto thank you than
 
06:28:27.430 --> 06:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just because you're not
 
06:28:29.948 --> 06:28:29.958 align:start position:0%
certified organic doesn't mean you're
 
06:28:34.670 --> 06:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
not organic um so there is a difference
 
06:28:38.030 --> 06:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
in the organic farmers in the farmers
 
06:28:41.670 --> 06:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
that practice IPM and no till management
 
06:28:44.468 --> 06:28:44.478 align:start position:0%
and other best practices on their Farms
 
06:28:47.708 --> 06:28:47.718 align:start position:0%
also contribute just as much as your
 
06:28:49.230 --> 06:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
certified organic
 
06:28:52.270 --> 06:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
farmers okay as we
 
06:28:56.030 --> 06:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
um so for the this particular
 
06:28:58.628 --> 06:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
Bill what I see is that it it's it's
 
06:29:00.910 --> 06:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
more of a mandate to the uh Department
 
06:29:00.920 --> 06:29:02.110 align:start position:0%
more of a mandate to the uh Department
of

06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:29:04.910 --> 06:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture that's correct and it says
 
06:29:09.390 --> 06:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
basically whether the organic program is
 
06:29:13.548 --> 06:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
of Ben well I don't want to it would the
 
06:29:16.310 --> 06:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
Organics organic programs the organic
 
06:29:18.948 --> 06:29:18.958 align:start position:0%
Community does benefit New Hampshire I
 
06:29:20.708 --> 06:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to say that it
 
06:29:24.430 --> 06:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't but if um and I would never say
 
06:29:26.708 --> 06:29:26.718 align:start position:0%
that because it does I mean organic
 
06:29:29.430 --> 06:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
farming is important it is an important
 
06:29:33.948 --> 06:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
element of our farming and agricultural
 
06:29:36.788 --> 06:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
endeav but what I see with this bill is
 
06:29:38.788 --> 06:29:38.798 align:start position:0%
that it is forcing the
 
06:29:42.030 --> 06:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner to run a program whether
 
06:29:46.190 --> 06:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
that program is successful or not and I
 
06:29:48.670 --> 06:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
and I see that that's a problem I I
 
06:29:53.110 --> 06:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
would rather leave this as a May than a
 
06:29:55.548 --> 06:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
shall rather than
 
06:29:59.190 --> 06:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
um uh forcing us to have a program that
 
06:30:01.910 --> 06:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
may or may not be successful or
 
06:30:04.310 --> 06:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the organic
 
06:30:07.548 --> 06:30:07.558 align:start position:0%
community and if something better comes
 
06:30:10.990 --> 06:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
along um we still have to be required to
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
run a program that would be ineffective
 
06:30:16.590 --> 06:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
or not not beneficial to to the farming
 
06:30:20.350 --> 06:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
community and that's why I'm I I have an
 
06:30:23.830 --> 06:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to changing the words made a
 
06:30:23.840 --> 06:30:26.070 align:start position:0%
opposition to changing the words made a
shell

06:30:26.070 --> 06:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
shell
 
06:30:29.468 --> 06:30:29.478 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins I'd like to ask
 
06:30:32.230 --> 06:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby how much
 
06:30:34.430 --> 06:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
confidence he has that this program
 
06:30:37.430 --> 06:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:37.440 --> 06:30:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
effective

06:30:41.430 --> 06:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:43.948 --> 06:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:30:47.750 --> 06:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
am uh I'm not entire I I don't have a
 
06:30:49.388 --> 06:30:49.398 align:start position:0%
solid sense of
 
06:30:54.310 --> 06:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
that and um I uh I am bringing forth
 
06:30:55.430 --> 06:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
this amend
 
06:30:58.590 --> 06:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
because um representative wolf asked me
 
06:31:02.830 --> 06:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
to and uh I am not going to speak
 
06:31:06.750 --> 06:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
against his bill but uh thank you you
 
06:31:09.868 --> 06:31:09.878 align:start position:0%
can you can stop right
 
06:31:12.468 --> 06:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
there no but then you know so I take a
 
06:31:14.468 --> 06:31:14.478 align:start position:0%
look at this and I say well we have
 
06:31:17.388 --> 06:31:17.398 align:start position:0%
right now an organic program in New
 
06:31:20.310 --> 06:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is the least expensive of
 
06:31:22.590 --> 06:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
the three that are around or the few
 
06:31:26.030 --> 06:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
that are around and yet we only have 66
 
06:31:28.510 --> 06:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
Farms that are engaged in
 
06:31:33.388 --> 06:31:33.398 align:start position:0%
it so I'm I'm just not sure
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
that that it's gonna be any benefit to
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
this representative kouan takeing my
 
06:31:46.110 --> 06:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
question um so I can tell you from
 
06:31:49.150 --> 06:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
personal experience that younger farmers
 
06:31:52.990 --> 06:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
are migrating away from USDA certified
 
06:31:55.468 --> 06:31:55.478 align:start position:0%
organic and so I kind of take issue with
 
06:31:58.948 --> 06:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
this bill because there are non USDA
 
06:32:01.510 --> 06:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
options now like certified naturally
 
06:32:05.230 --> 06:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
grown and of certified regeneratively
 
06:32:09.110 --> 06:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
grown so we should not be mandating
 
06:32:11.868 --> 06:32:11.878 align:start position:0%
organic I don't think it if anything if
 
06:32:16.270 --> 06:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
like we should be uh you know setting up
 
06:32:17.948 --> 06:32:17.958 align:start position:0%
a hub
 
06:32:20.350 --> 06:32:20.360 align:start position:0%
to point people toward whatever
 
06:32:23.830 --> 06:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
certification that they feel is best I
 
06:32:26.110 --> 06:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
think uh so I don't like this bill if I
 
06:32:28.750 --> 06:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
had to pick one of the two I would pick
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's but I don't think
 
06:32:35.948 --> 06:32:35.958 align:start position:0%
it's fair to mandate uh certified
 
06:32:39.190 --> 06:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
organic any other questions
 
06:32:42.628 --> 06:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
comments okay it's 4:30 let's go home
 
06:32:45.150 --> 06:32:45.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you again uh

points that you all bring up

06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
