00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
complete there's a larger plan involved
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
with this sale
 
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the department has been working with
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
the town of Windham to ultimately turn
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
over route 111a and reclassify it to a
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
class 5 Highway then the town of Windham
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
will take over maintenance
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for that as part of
 
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.690 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for that as part of
that

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh discussion the department has agreed
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
to discontinue the former route
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
111a which if you look at the plan it
 
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
kind of skirts off into a larger parcel
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
of property
 
00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:55.850 align:start position:0%
of property
um

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
so as part of that once that
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
discontinuance is complete under the
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
middle of the road Doctrine what happens
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
it's a prescription not it's an easement
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
highway so under the middle of the road
 
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.670 align:start position:0%
highway so under the middle of the road
Doctrine

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
Doctrine
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
that old road is split in half and it
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
goes to each of the two of Butters that
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
the the remaining property so it'll go
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
to the parcel that's a budding route
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
111a and then as the state the other
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
side will go to the state
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
so we were contacted by Crystal Ball
 
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
Enterprises to sell this property we've
 
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:32.660 align:start position:0%
been working with them for I think since
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
2019 they've gone out they've they're in
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
the subdivision process now
 
00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:39.230 align:start position:0%
the subdivision process now
um

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
this parcel was acquired in 1961 and it
 
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:45.980 align:start position:0%
was part of a larger
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
larger parcel and we paid eight thousand
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
six hundred and fifty dollars for it
 
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.150 align:start position:0%
six hundred and fifty dollars for it
um

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
so the property has a contributory value
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
of 22 000. now this is a small awkwardly
 
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.130 align:start position:0%
of 22 000. now this is a small awkwardly
shaped

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
shaped
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh P property so in the interest of
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
transparency this is
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
kind of an interesting uh disposal so in
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
December of this year another party
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
surfaced and I I just want to be clear
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
because the other party may have come
 
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
maybe here today and may wish to address
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
the committee so I I just want to be
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
clear about that so another party has
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
has come and they've expressed interest
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
in the property
 
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
in the property
so

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
their purpose for their their purpose
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
for wanting the property is for
 
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.210 align:start position:0%
for wanting the property is for
conservation

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
but it has no conservation value really
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
what it is is this person wants to buy
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
the property to restrict access to that
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
larger parcel and
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
basically it's a gorilla tactic to stop
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
the otherwise legally permissible
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
development of the parcel the department
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
has clearly told them now we're going to
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
proceed with the sale to
 
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.650 align:start position:0%
proceed with the sale to
um

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
so I just I wanted to be clear that
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%

thank you questions
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Pearl thank you just looking
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
at the map and I'm kind of curious why
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
you cut the corner off so much on that
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
is that for a future widening of the
 
00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:42.419 align:start position:0%
intersection likely so what happens is
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
we will when we get an inquiry regarding
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
a piece of property what we'll do is
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
we'll prepare what we call a
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
departmental review and
 
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.570 align:start position:0%
departmental review and
um

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
what then happens is we send out this
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
this packet similar package of what you
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
got here we send it out to our Bureau of
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
Highway design our Bureau of Highway
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
Maintenance Bureau of environment Bureau
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
of planning and also Bureau of
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics and Rail and Transit
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
then they'll come in and comment so my
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
guess is and I'm not sure likely
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance probably came back and said
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
well we need this for either to maintain
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
it or Highway design came back and we
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
should keep this for future widening
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%

motion carries I would like to I would
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
like to back up on an item I missed I
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
have two items
 
00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:25.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Shea on 2302
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
revised status yeah so again
 
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
um the packet
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
23-002 is just a compilation of the
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
various rsas this committee May
 
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
encounter through the items that come
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
before you so it's just a One-Stop shop
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
the second item that you had from us is
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
a it's a looks like a cover letter
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
and behind that is a it's called
 
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
guidelines and procedures so this
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
committee has typically approved a
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
series of guidelines that they would
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
like the agencies to adhere to when
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
disposing of property
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
um the I can go through each
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
point or the committee can read it
 
00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:14.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
all right I'm sorry go ahead so the
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
number one is basically that the sale
 
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.029 align:start position:0%
number one is basically that the sale
price

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
price
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
um when negotiating that shouldn't
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
fluctuate more than 10 percent from the
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
amount that the committee has been
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
when you're when the Departments are
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
determining a broker commission there's
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
thresholds for their percentages under
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
for um commissions for properties with
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
improved buildings it limits it to five
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
percent or that's what's recommended
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
and then the last two things are more um
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
for our office it's if you need um
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
an item on the agenda you need to get it
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
to us no later than two weeks before the
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting otherwise you gotta
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
request a permission from the chair to
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
so again these were things that the
 
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:04.940 align:start position:0%
committee has adopted in previous
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
sessions again the first four items
 
00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
three items are to provide guidance to
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
the agencies on
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
when they want to dispose of a piece of
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
property what they should consider
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
any any questions of Miss Shea
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
