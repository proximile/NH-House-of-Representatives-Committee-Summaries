the Department of Education manage
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
special education dispute resolution

processes during State fiscal years 2020
 
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.230 align:start position:0%
processes during State fiscal years 2020
through

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
2022 we reviewed over 16 00 regulatory
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and corresponding internal
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
controls for six processes available
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
through the department to help parents
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
and schools resolve special education
 
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
disputes these were primarily issues
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
related to students with an
 
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
IEP the report includes a background
 
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
section and three chapters we will pause
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
after presenting each section to provide
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for questions or comments
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I will turn it over to

report thank you
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
Christine good morning has Christine
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
introduced me and my name is Paige
 
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
Lauren getting right into the executive
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
summary in page one we found the
 
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
department lacked adequate controls and
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
did not effectively manage dispute
 
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.550 align:start position:0%
did not effectively manage dispute
resolution

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
processes existing controls were not
 
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
were limited informal inconsistently
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
implemented and not clearly documented
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
or communicated dispute resolution
 
00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
requirements were unnecessarily complex
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
an issue we first reported on in
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
1991 many Department requirements were
 
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
established through ad hoc rules which
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
could not be enforced we also found
 
00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 align:start position:0%
Department practices were not always
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with laws and rules
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
ineffective internal controls and the
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
resulting issues we identified
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
compromise compliance and transparency
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
and potentially compromise State
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility for federal ass assistance
 
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
ineffectiveness also added unnecessary
 
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
costs and St and barriers for parents
 
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
and other stakeholders our
 
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation summary begins on page
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
five the department con concurred fully
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
or in part with all 20 of the
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
observations in the report five
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
observations may require legislative
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
action which I will note when it's
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%

after the audit period this concludes
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
the background chapter if there are any
 
00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:04.759 align:start position:0%
questions at this point okay from the
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
committee are there any questions on
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
that the next section we're going to get
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
into is management control and I think
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going to have a lot
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
of questions uh are there any questions
 
00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:17.550 align:start position:0%
of questions uh are there any questions
so

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
far page why why don't you continue then
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
please our management control chapter
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
starts in page

processes well-designed properly
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
implemented and monitored controls can
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
help efficiently and effectively achieve
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
objectives ensure responsibilities are

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
two under state laws there's a source
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
where the responsibility comes
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
from and I'm concerned that where the
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
issue is not performed not performed not
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
performed is mentioned four times uh
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
three time two times for the state and
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
then uh the others one or two times the
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
when you're doing this are you asking
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
the question why are they not
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
performed in conjunction with state law
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
we do I I believe some of the areas we
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
found was an un awareness of the the
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
requirement so some staff just did not
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
know this was a requirement um I not
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
sure if this
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
is I believe in observation number three
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
we talk about delegation of authority
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
and it's a contributing factor that it
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
was established in laws and rules but it
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't formally delegated to staff so
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
several of us served with uh John Reagan
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
when we went through this several years
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
back and requested the LBA audit and I
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
think this is reflecting some of the
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
concerns page
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
31 under observation number two
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
management did not proactively evaluate
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
and address issues or provide adequate
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%
oversight of
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
were hearing when we went with the the
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh Advocate the special education
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
Advocate um and I'd like to know perhaps
 
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
a little later from the Department where
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
are we on trying to ensure that this is
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
occurring properly and then I'm just
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
going through some of the areas that I
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
have so maybe I can wake up some of the
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%

pushed for the
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
audit and then going on to page um 18
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
under table
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
four uh New Hampshire shall evaluate the
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%

responsible for it in table

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
um going on to page
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
45 under observation five where it says
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement contract
 
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement contract
management

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
controls special education dispute
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
resolution contract manage was
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
ineffective nhed lacked comprehensive
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
controls existing controls were limited
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
and unimplemented and monitoring was
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
inadequate question is is this something
 
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's been ongoing over the last decade
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
um so that might be a question we can
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
answer in a few minutes um page 47
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh where it says regul regulatory
 
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
non-compliance New Hampshire Ed lack
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
controls to ensure contractors complied
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
with federal and state special education
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
laws and rules during dispute resolution
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
process that's
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
huge and we're letting out contracts are
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
is there any accountability for these
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
contracts um are are we getting the bang
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
for our
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
51 uh on the third paragraph down or the
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
second paragraph starting with
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
Contracting Contracting and retaining
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
enough investigators continue to be an
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
issue I know we're short uh and so
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
Staffing over at Department of Education
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
um is that an area that may be something
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's been recommended by by you that
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
the legislature tried to maybe fund some
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
of these uh areas page
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
52 in the second last paragraph on that
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
P page staff acknowledged there were not
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
enough hearing officers to comply with
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
mediation scheduling requirements that
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
kind of linked with what I just
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned um so I I get that on page
 
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
57 I'm almost done here uh the first
 
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
bullet New Hampshire
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
Ed did not establish procedures to
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
identify and disclose conflicts of
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
interest for five of six dispute
 
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.909 align:start position:0%
interest for five of six dispute
resolution

00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
processes so the people are being hired
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
to do these investigate now is there a
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
conflict in terms of um uh the
 
00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
contractor accepting and conducting
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
these processes is there a conflict with
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
that particular um uh person
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
investigating that contractor with the
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
the with the uh being too close I guess
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
to some of these
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
situations um then I I guess a big one
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
for me is on page
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
61 right on the top of the page there
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
last sentence without sufficient cost
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
tracking and controls New Hampshire Ed
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
could not ensure state and federal funds
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
were consistently expended
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately that's accountability for
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
the dollars that we're appropriating and
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
the next sentence down under inadequate
 
00:18:45.149 --> 00:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
contractor payment controls contractor
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
payment controls were inadequate and
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
insufficient to reduce fraud risk
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's a word that we don't want to get
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
fraud I don't know if I'm getting close
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
to where you ended I had other areas um
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
but I'll stop right there so those are
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
all areas which some captured my
 
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
attention really quickly here and it
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
kind of Echoes what Senator Reagan was
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
after and we were after i' just like to
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
know where are we now in terms of
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
addressing some of these really severe
 
00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.710 align:start position:0%
addressing some of these really severe
significant

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
issues is that a question for LBA or is
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
that question for believe that's for the
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
Department if you'd like them to talk
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
okay other concerns or questions
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank you I it
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
keeps saying management and I don't is
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
there a definition of management or who
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
is management or uh we Define management
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
as staff with the authority to supervise
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
and make policy and procedural decisions
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
on the operations so uh literal
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
management positions all the way up to
 
00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:53.669 align:start position:0%
management positions all the way up to
the

00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay so it would be the
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner assigning people to those
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
positions and they are supposed to do
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
what the implementation who's
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for implementing the
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
requirements okay yeah thank you perent
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
would talk thank you chairman good
 
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
morning I'm sure you have all his
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
questions in order an answer right yeah
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
okay um but thank you uh my question
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
goes back uh following along represent
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
lad's uh comment but mine simpler one
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
question or two um in the executive
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
summary when you offered the uh issues
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
um I fig page five or
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
something sure what number it was but um
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
P one page one there you go thanks um
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
and you outlined in your chart on page
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
five the uh issues and the concurrence
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
and non-c concurrence my question is um
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
what happens next to those
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations and who's responsible
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
for that so our the lb's responsibility
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
ends here um there is an executive order
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
for the Department to report on the
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
progress of our audits I believe it's a
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
90 I'm not positive the timeline but
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
they have to be reported to the
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
and there's incremental reporting after
 
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.230 align:start position:0%
and there's incremental reporting after
that

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
during the fiscal committee meeting
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
where we released this report uh they
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
also re required Christine corly update
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly updates on the progress of the
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
resolution of these
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
findings okay go ahead thank you
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so the the uh 45 days or the
 
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
90-day followup direction is that under
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
that March 15th date that you said that
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
or the rep was
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
released when the clock when's this
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
clock start again yes once the report
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
publicly release the clock starts okay
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you CH you're welcome
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
further questions yes representative
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
cascaden thank you um uh my question is
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
since this report is looking at data
 
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
since this report is looking at data
from

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
2017 has there been other legislative
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
audits done before or is this the very
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
first time on this
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
topic than oh when you do an audit then
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
you break it out into different topics
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
Okay so yes on dispute resolution so we
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh we referenced a couple audits in our
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
glossery okay there's a 1991 in a
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
1999 performance audit they weren't
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
directly for dispute resolution but they
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
did have certain findings that were
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to this audit but this is the
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
first time that we did an audit specific
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
to dispute resolution processes okay
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah further questions from
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent leus
 
00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:01.070 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent leus
thank

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
you is there a
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
person that is in charge of
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
overseeing these specific this
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
particular department or this particular
 
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
you know dispute resolution is there one
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
person who's responsible for making sure
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
this all
 
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
works so for the operational part it is
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
spread out across the department
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
depending on which dispute resolution
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
process uh monitoring is also part of
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
that that's also a different part of the
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
department um which is one of the
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
reasons why we have observation number
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
three because of how it's spread out
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
across the department So currently there
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
is not a person that's responsible not
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
for all six okay thank um I will say
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
that five out of the six that fall under
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
one manager
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
supervision there are multiple staff
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
members involved across the department
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
however okay yeah thank you representa
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
Terry uh thank you you uh I'd just like
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
to drill down a bit more on the question
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to um
 
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.909 align:start position:0%
with respect to um
management

00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
um what uh I presume that would would
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
include two classifications of people if
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
you will um those who are appointees
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
such as the commissioner and full-time
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps career employees of the
 
00:24:25.389 --> 00:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
department if that is
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
correct by the nodding of your head I
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
or no or
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
words I would like to follow up so
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
management will consist of the
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
appointees and classified and
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
unclassified okay could could you
 
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
characterize the the number or the
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
percentage with respect to
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
appointees uh as a percentage of the
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
total and the full-time employees as a
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total we talking like
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
5% 95 2080 could you since you're
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
Auditors I would assume that you're
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
going to have some kind of fix on that
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
we don't you don't know we don't how
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
many are employees and you just know
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
their management you don't Staffing
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
analysis you don't know okay so for the
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of this audit we didn't would
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
you say that it's likely that that most
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the the folks in the management
 
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
category are full-time career employees
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
rather than appointees I believe that's
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
true thank you thank you other questions
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you and thank you
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
for being here um on the the face of it
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
this appears to be a pretty damning
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
report as it relates to the study that
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
you've done the one question I guess I
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
have and we'll get into more questions
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure later but this has been a focus
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
department um what in your review what
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
role does the local school district play
 
00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
if any as it relates to this report so
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
we have not quite gotten to that point
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
yet there is uh the there are monitoring
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
and enforcement responsibilities the
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
department has over local educational
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
agencies or schools uh which an
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
observation in this does address their
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
role limited to dispute resolution
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
process requirements so is there a
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
followup and and the rest of your study
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
that will then cover that particular
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
area I'm sorry
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
right our office is currently performing
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
another audit of the special education
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
program that audit will cover uh
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
everything other than
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
this thank so there is a larger audit
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing right now yes this that's
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
correct we were on this one right here
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
was due process and that's where we
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
ended up going the direction of the
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
Advocate uh being separated from HHS and
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
d uh doe uh but we we did not go into
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
the other areas of special education
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know the whole gamut we didn't do
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
that yes just just another another point
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
was you you mentioned the concern about
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
the the loss of federal funds as a
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
result of what you found in this report
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
can you expand a little bit more on that
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
please sure so for receiving a grant
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
Award of federal funds agencies have to
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
develop internal controls um for to
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that the funds are being expended
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
appropriately and in accordance with the
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of those
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
grants uh it happens to be that those
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
internal control standards are the same
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
exact standards that we use to audit
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
agencies and not so much for those three
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
state processes that were developed but
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
for the three that are federally
 
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:50.200 align:start position:0%
required we found those internal
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
controls were not in place according to
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
the requirements of receiving Grant
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
Awards that's where we find um they're
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
potentially a risk at losing Federal
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
funding if Federal monitors or the
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
agency comes in and determines they are
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
also not sufficient internal controls
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
just as a follow again on that point do
 
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:14.200 align:start position:0%
you have any contact with the federal
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
agencies or is that clearly within the
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
purview of the department we do not yeah
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
 
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.590 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions
represent

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
being here and for your work I have two
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
questions so one you referenced that
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
although there wasn't a prior due
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
process audit that there were some
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
findings in the 1991 and I think you
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
said 1999 that were
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
relevant were those findings addressed
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
or are they still present concerns we uh
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
noted them in observations as
 
00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate normally we put an appendix
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
at the back to show the progress of the
 
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh previous audit findings however since
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
these are over 30 years old Federal
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and state requirements have
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
changed so much then we didn't take them
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
for one for one so where we found
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
long-standing issues
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
from these findings we noted them in
 
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.990 align:start position:0%
from these findings we noted them in
those

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
observations okay and then if I may um
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
and the audit that is ongoing looking at
 
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
the rest of special education Beyond due
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
process when would that be expected to
 
00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:27.029 align:start position:0%
process when would that be expected to
be

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
reported we don't expect that audit to
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
be completed until um closer towards the
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
end of this calendar
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
year man and does that audit represent
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
the same time period as
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
this that audit I believe is just for
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
one fisal year which one is that correct
 
00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.389 align:start position:0%
one fisal year which one is that correct
Jay

00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
Jay
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
yeah that manager is not here at the
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
moment so he would be able to answer but
 
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
I think it's just for one fiscal year do
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
we know which one
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
20 22 so it overlaps with this yes thank
 
00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:07.559 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent luno
 
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair along the
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
um the same line as as the question from
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative Damon oh and thank you
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
very much for uh for being here and and
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
leading us through this this very
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
detailed report um following um on
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's first question
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
I'm jumping ahead a little bit into a um
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
um a statement that you make on page 7
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
70 under regulatory but I think it
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
applies under management control as well
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
um in the last paragraph and it refers
 
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
to the two audits that um represent
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
Damon was was just referring to but then
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say nhed reportedly had no
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
plans to address recommendations in a
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
relevant report released in November
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
2021 so much more recent than than the
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
earlier reports
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh by the committee to study special
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
education dispute resolution opt options
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
and the burden of proof and doe process
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
hearings so the the the the com the
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
statement here is nhed reportedly had no
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
plans to address the
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations um I was wondering did
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
you get to a why um they've got no no
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
plans to address some um recommendations
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
that were clearly relevant to this area
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
right so when we say no plans it's more
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
of that internal control where there
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
should be procedures in place to address
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations from uh evaluations and
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
audit findings that's what we mean by no
 
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
plans they didn't have procedures in
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
place to ensure recommendations and
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
audit findings went through a specific
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
process to uh remediate those issues
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
um so that's why there why they hadn't
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
established it's a procedural control
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
that just wasn't
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
established it wasn't that they didn't
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
want to remediate findings it's the
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
procedures were in place to ensure that
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
happened yeah further questions
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
represent Celli thank you thank you very
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
much for being here and going through
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
this um with us um follow up on a couple
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
of um points made um I think
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Miler was uh talking
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
about the costs and um a note on page 63
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
under your recommendations uh develop
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
and Implement procedures to effectively
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
determine costs associated with special
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
ed dispute resolution processes for
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
staff contractors and
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um refer that back to also
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
um I think there been references to um
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
complexity of due process um
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and we've heard about that
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
um in testimony on uh prior legislation
 
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
that we've dealt with this year um would
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
you um agree that complexity and um in
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
some places ad hoc
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
rules um that uh are actually encouraged
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
at the local level um add to the
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
complexity and possibly add to the costs
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
for um the department and
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
also you highlight um stakeholder costs
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
which we have heard about for since I've
 
00:33:29.389 --> 00:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
been here um so is there a complexity
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
Factor associated with costs yes and I
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
believe we mentioned that in part of the
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
observation is that uh it's one of the
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
major barriers that stakeholders
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
reported which
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
either some I reported that they would
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
have to hire legal help because of that
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
um even as Auditors we found it very
 
00:33:55.149 --> 00:33:55.159 align:start position:0%
complex to understand these requirements
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh the ad hoc rules definitely
 
00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.909 align:start position:0%
uh the ad hoc rules definitely
contributed

00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
contributed
 
00:34:03.629 --> 00:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
um with the complexity because many of
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
these requirements weren't known to
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
everybody without being formally
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
established in laws and rules um which I
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
believe we do may have a little section
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
on that as a cost to stakeholders those
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
barriers yes
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I think it's mentioned in here
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
also um that um we have I'm sorry thank
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
you um we have the rules we have state
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
law and federal law and in some cases
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
never the twain shall meet um and that
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
um you know we do have charts and I'm
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm getting a chart um made copies of
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
for everybody um of where we have rules
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
that go above and beyond state or
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
federal law which in my mind um is two
 
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.550 align:start position:0%
federal law which in my mind um is two
problems

00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
um possibly the complexity is involved
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
there um as well but as a legislator I
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
have problems when we have rules that go
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
beyond um laws that have been passed
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
either federally or here in New
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um because there is um little
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislative input other other than Jael
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
car who maybe aren't um totally up to um
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
the level of knowledge um that we we
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
correcting um this term but
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
um is that um maybe over
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
regulation on the part of the state in
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
not in compliance with state or federal
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
law is that part of the complexity
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
issue so you're asking if having the
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
standards in excess oh is that over
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
relation the the rules in excess of of
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
law we did look at the uh the rules that
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
were noted on that chart I I think we're
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
skipping a little bit ahead yeah I'm
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah no and observation number I
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
think observation number 10 references
 
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
that standards and excess chart what we
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
actually found was that not everything
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
that should be included was included on
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
that chart um we did not have an opinion
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
or conclude on whether those standards
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
were appropriately in excess
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
we decided that was up for the
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
department and the legislature to
 
00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
decide thank you further questions or
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
shall we go on represent Woodcock and
 
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
then then we'll go on for further
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
presentation thank you I just I want to
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
go back I want to make sure I'm clear on
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
this on the page 567 that the 20
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations now that's the summary
 
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of as
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
audit yes okay and when I asked uh what
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
the next step was and you said there's
 
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.270 align:start position:0%
the next step was and you said there's
quarterly

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
updates on those things does this
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
committee or who gets those who follow
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively where do we see the
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
progress how do we get that so
 
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
the yeah so the Department
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
administrative Services W the 45 or
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
90day and incremental updates those must
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
be submitted to the Department of
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrative services and it's posted
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
to transparent New Hampshire so it's
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
publicly posted okay and then the fiscal
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
committee quarterly updates will be
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
either inform AAL or an agenda item on
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
meetings okay
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
um that's the extent of those two okay
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
all right I'll probably back to that in
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
a minute thank you much thank you
 
00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
chairman lad thank you very much FL for
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
than them we're going to go ahead with
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
it yes followup so so who has the final
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
oversight for the implementation and the
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
monitoring of the recommendations from
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
your report the department does we only
 
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
check in on prior Audits and the status
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
of Prior audits if there's an
 
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
overlapping audit topic or we're

directed to go back to that program or
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
agency so there's no legislative
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
oversight to this report it's it's
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
basically the department then that has
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
the that has the the ultimate management
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
of the department basically oversights
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
it report
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
correct yes and the fiscal committee can
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
request that the department comes back
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
and continue to report on the progress
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the uh findings in our reports as
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you okay I I think you
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
can take us further into the report here
 
00:38:37.079 --> 00:38:37.870 align:start position:0%
can take us further into the report here
and

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.990 align:start position:0%
and
then

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%

which was a long-standing issue several

dispute resolution practices and

understood and effectively
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
communicated School representatives were
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
not always aware of certain requirements
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
and some stakeholders reported a need
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
for training and education however the
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
department did not provide proactive
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
training and education for dispute
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
resolution requirements and did not
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
identify groups of stakeholders which
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
would benefit from receiving training
 
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.470 align:start position:0%
would benefit from receiving training
and

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
and

education this concludes the second

chapter if there are any questions at
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
this point are there questions from the
 
00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
committee regarding this this
 
00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:27.630 align:start position:0%
committee regarding this this
chapter

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh I I I'd like to go back to page 71
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
please and there's two sets of bullets
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
there we're using words not consistently
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
or clearly
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
implementing um the the bullet that says
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
report on whether leas took corrective
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
action to comply with federal and state
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
law in monitoring I would think that
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's something we we want to do after
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
going through a a a a due process and
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
then monitoring correct
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
action how did you assess that this was
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
not being done uh we were informed and
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
we did not find evidence that dispute
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
resolution monitoring was part of the
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
Department's program so special
 
00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
education monitoring was happening but
 
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
processes and the last bullet there says
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
enforce a requirement that Lea's
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
provider written report within 90 days
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
of a due process hearing describing Etc
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
um so that didn't come in either from
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
the laa to the the department correct
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
that was another requirement that we
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
found was not formally delegated to
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
ensure it was being
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
implemented okay and and that is that a
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
department issue or is that a local
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
school district issue the department is
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for ensuring the local
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
schools follow requirements thank you
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
Cornell so to get back to representative
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
chairman lad's question did do the elas
 
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
know that they're supposed to do that it
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
sounds like there's not a lot of
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
communication to the leas of what what
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for right so we did
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
ask I'm not I do not remember if we
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
asked this specific question but we did
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
ask certain procedural requirements in
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
our local education survey and we found
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
some of those many schools are not aware
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
of those requirements I'm not sure if
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
this was one of those that we asked
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
about thank you y and I'll follow up
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
with does doe I read in the report and I
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
don't know where but many of this is
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
done because the staff member At Doe has
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
a historical background of how things
 
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:45.640 align:start position:0%
did occur is not necessarily written
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
down in a book it's just I have the
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
history of this process and then folks
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
are changing or leaving their position
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
and you lose that history is that sort
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
of what's going on here that we we have
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's understood by this
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
person this person leaves and the whole
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
process leaves with that person right
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
and uh so our policies and procedures
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
observation addresses that as well a lot
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
of the institutional knowledge was
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
reliant on staff who had been there for
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
not that many years uh there was one
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
tene staff member in of the six who were
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
part of the dispute resolution processes
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
who was also nearing retirement so there
 
00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
was a huge risk of knowledge loss at
 
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.670 align:start position:0%
was a huge risk of knowledge loss at
that

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
Point further yes represent
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I uh I think that a
 
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
lot of this section um relates to what
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
overlap um with the leas and um I recall
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
that uh when we first started the
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
performance audit and looking at the
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
scope of work several of us um submitted
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
um issues that you weren't looking at
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
the local level when looking at do due
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
process you were just looking at um the
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
state level and so uh you know I'm very
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that um I knowing how broad
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
an issue special education is that there
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
is a separate audit that will um address
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
some of these areas and hopefully some
 
00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.559 align:start position:0%
of this overlap because um again on page
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
71 where um uh chairman lad was talking
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
about it says state law required leas to
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
notify the department when a parent had
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
rejected an IEP placement identification
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
or evaluation and again we've heard
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on that issue um uh previously
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh this year and um I I think that will
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
be something I want to bring up when we
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
get um into another step maybe the next
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
section of the uh of the uh audit
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
review but I I think that that's um
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
troubling um for both the state and for
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
the parents um when they've
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
rejected um let's say an IEP
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation and they're in limbo in
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
many cases um so I I think that some of
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
these um might be easily corrected um
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that's my hope and um we'll keep
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
watch on it thank
 
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to slip back to page 67
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's in the sort of in the same ballpark
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
that represent cordelli is speaking to
 
00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
that represent cordelli is speaking to
there's

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh where it says additionally comma
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
rules the last bullet there struck my
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
attention here it says did not establish
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
a process for parents to open due
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
process hearings to the public despite
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
being a federally established parental
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
right um so it gets back to my my
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
curiosi is do the local school districts
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
know the we we supposedly have directors
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
that are on top of uh directing special
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
education at the local level but are
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
they knowledgeable of all these
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in
 
00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
requirements that are in
[Music]

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
idea as I stated before we did ask about
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
certain requirements uh unfortunately
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
because the local processes were not
 
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.750 align:start position:0%
because the local processes were not
monitored

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
monitored
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
or reviewed during the processes much of
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
what we would like to know if was
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
happening at the local level was not
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
auditable at the state level um however
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the training and
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
education observation is because we did
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
find that there are certain requirements
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
that local education agencies
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
specifically stated they were unaware of
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
and would like more training
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that answers your question
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
is this responsibility the department or
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the local school
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
board it's the responsibility of the
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
department to make sure the requirements
 
00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
are being followed and in accordance
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
with how they should be
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
followed I I think it's both but it
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
starts with the Department thank you
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
further questions rips on my one on that
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
point did you have an assessment of
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me did you you have an assessment
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
relationship between the department and
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
the leas across the state I mean is
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
there is there a close working
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
relationship between the department and
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
the local school districts is there an
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
estrangement between the two of them I
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
mean how does what is the communication
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
issues that are between the two so for
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
this small of a scope we did do the
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
appendix D has the educational agency
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
survey um wasn't a great result that 22%
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
of the leas filled it out but the
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
results are generally positive there
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
were some certain areas like I said they
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
expressed more Assistance or better
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
procedures um but as far as the
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
relationship between the leas and the
 
00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:17.799 align:start position:0%
department itself I it was pretty
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
positive thank you yep thank
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
you you represent luno so so thanks very
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair th this isn't directly Rel
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
related to regulatory or or management
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
but sort of um just just in general was
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if you got any sense as to the
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
um the percentage of of uh of complaints
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
that that arose from students attending
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh Public Schools compared to uh to
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools or if there was the you
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
know um because because the um the Lea
 
00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
the public school is responsible right
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
for special education services at at uh
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
at the chartered um schools as well but
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there was maybe a a
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
proportionate percentage of the
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
complaints coming from Charters or or
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
disproportionate so we didn't include
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
the demographic data in our scope of
 
00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:16.799 align:start position:0%
file reviews um I'm sure the department
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
might have a little bit more information
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
on that okay thanks thank you yes
 
00:51:23.069 --> 00:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
Pell thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
my question um what is the federal
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
oversight of the implementation of these
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
requirements because we're talking about
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
the um the Department's requirements to
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
implement them but what how does the
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
federal government get involved in um
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
overseeing the insurance that these
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
regulations are
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
implemented I'll let the dep Department
 
00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:50.799 align:start position:0%
continue on that answer but uh as far as
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
what we saw in the federally required
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
reporting it's very limited to certain
 
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
for dispute resolution it's a very very
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
very very small portion of oversight um
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
limited to certain targets or
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
percentages of completion or Su success
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
rates or which is resulting in a formal
 
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
agreement for some of these processes um
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what else is part of that
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
because we didn't look at that process
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
but the department will be able to speak
 
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:20.510 align:start position:0%

that I can also just add to that um the
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um has a an
 
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
annual audit of uh the state's federal

auditor performs that audit and there
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
would be findings in that audit if there
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
were any issues that came up uh with the

um
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
being a former it guy um hits me and
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
that it says
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%

acknowledged the database was outdated
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
and insufficient tracking needs um we
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
again we've talked about this a little
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
bit um and for years I've heard about um
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
the database and I forget the acronym um
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
Ness and something or maybe that's a TV
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
channel I don't know um but um the uh I
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
I took the opportunity to you know just
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
glance through um and found at least
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
four or five um specific special
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
education uh
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
databases um one with power school a
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
module of power school which a lot of
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
districts um use I believe um and uh
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
Connecticut just three or four years ago
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
had a system developed for them and I've
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
got I think the majority of the
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
functional specifications that they use
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
for that um but I think that uh a new
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
system uh to manage special
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
education that would be used by all
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
districts not just some of them U I even
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
heard just recently that um maybe the
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
current system has some um abilities in
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
it for tracking that haven't been used
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you know I I think what we need is
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
someone to come in and do an
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the current system what um
 
00:59:09.789 --> 00:59:09.799 align:start position:0%
what is outdated what functionality is
 
00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:11.720 align:start position:0%
there what functionality is not being
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
used and then look at that um in
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
comparison to some of these other
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
systems that are available that I think
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
would help immensely in terms of
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
controls and tracking which are two of
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
the major um areas covered in in this um
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
report um so that's you number one for
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
me but um maybe number two and three um
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
99 um and this this I've let you know
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
you have your legislative um uh to-do
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
list well I've got my own um and one of
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
those comes on page
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
99 where it says some parents reported
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
feeling forced or pressured to sign a
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
agreements and um left no their options
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
to obtain necessary Ser services and
 
01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
fearful of
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
retaliation um we've heard that from
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
parents in the past um and that's um
 
01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's on my legislative to-do list um
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
um then on the next page 100 um we
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
suggest the legislator legislature
 
01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:21.799 align:start position:0%
consider reviewing usage agreements
 
01:00:21.799 --> 01:00:22.950 align:start position:0%
consider reviewing usage agreements
including

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure and non-disparagement
 
01:00:25.119 --> 01:00:26.750 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure and non-disparagement
clauses

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
clauses
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh to determine whether policy changes
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
are needed um and
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
um uh I I would say yes um um and I
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
worked on legislation for that um so um
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know we'll see what happens in the
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
future but uh certainly there are uh for
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
mediation and some of the due process
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
hearing um processes there are federal
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
requirements in terms of
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure but in many cases from
 
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
what I've heard from parents
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements are
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
required as a beginning step to go
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
forward with the mediation or something
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
which is not required under federal law
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's another area where
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
we can have um an impact um with
 
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um in the next session if
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
not with uh um non gerain amendments uh
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
on Senate
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
bills thank you if I could just clarify
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
the databases that we're talking about
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
for dispute resolution are separate from
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay the special education I believe the
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
acronym is nessus New Hampshire special
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
education information system so that
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
system handles all other aspects of
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
special education or most and so this is
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
a this is a their separate it's a
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
separate database there's multiple uh
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and databases as part of
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
this yeah so am I correct in my thinking
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
that maybe one comprehensive system to
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
combine some of those spreadsheets and
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous other um uh data sources
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
might uh help with tracking and controls
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
I believe the department uh I'm not sure
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
if they put it in their recommendation
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
or their response specifically but I
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
believe the department was looking into
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
other options right and I see one was a
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
Salesforce that's in use
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
um by other departments and um my big
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
notation there was no um we need
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
education yes represent luno thank you
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair just sort of a
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
process question does the um does the
 
01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:50.039 align:start position:0%
state need to make its own state laws in
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
order for the Department of Education to
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
enact rules to comply with um with
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
can you rephrase that a little bit so so
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
just as representative cordelli was
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
talking about there's federal laws and
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
there's state laws yes and and uh the
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
rule making the um that each that all
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
the Departments do basically have an
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
underpinning by in Statute in state law
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm wondering can the
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
can the department conduct Ru making uh
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
to with using a federal law as its
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
underpinning yes so for the state
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
complaint process there's actually no
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
state laws for state complaints it goes
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
strict uh straight from federal to the
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
rules okay and that's fine um some one
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
of some of the we still identified
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
issues between connecting those two but
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
you don't need to connect with the state
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
law between those two okay and and and
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
and I I know it's in here somewhere and
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
you probably talk about so followup are
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
there are there is there additional Ru
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
making that that you're recommending
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
that the department of Ed do in order to
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
be compliant with federal law yes uh so
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements observation
 
01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:13.710 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements observation
number

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
nine if I have that right um that's most
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the areas where we talk about the
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
federal requirements and the ru making
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
align with each other okay thank you
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes represent whitcock thank you going
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
back no no U but that the 20 I just want
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand this report I
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
looked at it I read it through the
 
01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
executive summ twice and I sort of scan
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
this so the the reports that you talked
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
about going through follow up at each
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
part of the executive summary they just
 
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
elaborate what was in the executive
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
summary right okay so uh repr leas a
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
while ago uh asked the question about
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
she was trying to find out I think who
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for what uh and then we
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
talked about additional uh special
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
education uh ongoing or soon to go uh
 
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
another audit so I'm looking at I'm
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
looking at um page 25 going back just to
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
the table
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
organization so and I'm probably
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
Incorrect and that's why I'm going to
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
ask you to help me here I'm assuming
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
that when it says offer the commission
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the commissioner of
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
Education alot right okay that's that's
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
the big guy okay so in terms of this
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
which only covers two years 20 to
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
22 but is
 
01:05:32.559 --> 01:05:34.870 align:start position:0%
22 but is
um

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh huge in terms of the implications of
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
of lack of oversight in and Regulatory
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
workare now am I am I looking at the
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
left-and side the governance unit that's
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
where all this falls under and on the
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
right hand side is going to be the
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
additional audit is that how we look at
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
that right
 
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:56.910 align:start position:0%
that right
so

01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
these these two sides are both dispute
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
resolution yes the majority of the
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
special education audit is going to fall
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
under the division of learner support
 
01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau of special education support
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's for most of the next audit the
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
next a okay so so you almost can write a
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
line down this this a on the left hand
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
side next a on the right hand side so
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the issues that
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mila had and cordelli
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
were talking about local school boards
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh in their their interaction and those
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
types of reference are going to be more
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
right hand side report right that hasn't
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
come yet but so all these um
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary issues only for just the
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
last two years not only how long it
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
could have been beyond that all on the
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
left-hand side for the most
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
part that right so yes so four uh five
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the six processes are on the left
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
side right one of the processes and
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring responsibilities are on the
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
right side yeah yes okay and may just
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
fall okay thank you so I'm looking
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
at what the part think represent luno
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
refering to but I have a high time
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is well over 75% of your
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
um 20
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations the department concurs
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
accurate and then there's some
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
partially how does that
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
happen that you have an exhaustive
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
report that identifies 20 major flaws
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
ongoingly on a daily basis
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
and the respond
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
concur it depends sometimes uh there may
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
be disagreement with the facts in our
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
observation and not specifically the
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh sometimes the
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
department may feel that the
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations are not feasible to
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
implement um
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
so if they're not feasible to implement
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
they just don't do
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
it it may be it depends again I'm not
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
speaking directly for the Department
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
okay but um if it sometimes if they may
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
not be able to implement because they
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
feel there's some kind of statutory
 
01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
restrictions or resource restrictions
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
and it's really up to them to determine
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's cost effective and makees
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
sense to change those or request more
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
resources so right one more simp yes go
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you the last one this
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this can you tell me
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
how many hours the staff invested in
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
doing this audit your staff your
 
01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
department we have that number but not
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
on us
 
01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
huh we right we we do have that number
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have it with us today though so
 
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
i' have to go back curious It's so
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
exhausted was curious how many hours of
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay it's a lot of effort yeah I just it
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
seems like it I started this audit in
 
01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.189 align:start position:0%
seems like it I started this audit in
March

01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
March
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
2022 so two years ago
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
yes and I had two to three staff in and
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
out during that time period wow okay hey
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman live thank
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
you paage uh when you're doing this
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
audit I'm looking at page 111
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh and looking at
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
contractors and processes that have or
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
have not been filed IE reference
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
fura uh using their own private email to
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
address confidential issues dealing with
 
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.910 align:start position:0%
address confidential issues dealing with
the

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
IEP um uh in your looking at contractors
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
and because it's been mentioned
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
throughout here uh is there a process
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
you found that's fairly consistent that
 
01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
there's criteria is spelled out there's
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
a a handbook available to contractors
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
what their responsibilities are they
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
shall report they shall do this this and
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is that available to the
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
contractors so it depended on the
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
contractor the hearing and the process
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
so the hearing officers we found who
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
were responsible for four out of the six
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
processes did have more robust
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
requirements and a handbook however we
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
also found that the handbook was not
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
required and the information Within it
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
was not being enforced so so there's no
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
oversight the management control part
 
01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
correct yes yeah repes
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
luno so thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
along those same lines and um and sort
 
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
of along lines of what representative
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
Woodcock was was talking
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
about there there there seems to be a a
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
lack of of and the there's consistency
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the report but I'm talking about in
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
respon from the Department to to some of
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
the findings and recommendations in the
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
in the report for example um on uh on
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
page 68 under regulatory framework where
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
the um where the department um concurs
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
only in part with the
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh the department goes
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
on to say the governance unit has
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
processes to help ensure that it
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
complies with federal and state
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
timelines and assess where these
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
procedures can be can be developed so
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
that they're more comprehensive and
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
formal so they say that I'm I'm and I'm
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
that that seems to be where they
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
disagree with either your finding a
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation but then on page 89 so
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
that's in regulatory framework and then
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
on page 89 under performance and
 
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement um um one of the findings is
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
so this is in the middle of page 89 we
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed a judgmental sample of 12 due
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
process complaint cases out of 115
 
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh from fiscal years 20 to 22 we found
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
due process timelines were not
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
sufficiently tracked in the database so
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
here we've got an example of of where
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
the where the the the department
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
disagrees with a finding under
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory framework saying that they've
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
got the process in place but then under
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
under performance and execution clearly
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have the process in place and
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
and I I guess this isn't so much of a a
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
question but but to you but maybe a
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
question to the committee do we need to
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
do a
 
01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
crosswalk um between regulatory per and
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
and performance and management controls
 
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
to to see where maybe the Department's
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
response is inconsistent with findings
 
01:12:19.229 --> 01:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
um found in other sections of the uh the
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
audit so this a question to you Mr
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
chair I want to be very careful not to
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
start into the executive
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and and what our
 
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility is of course we write law
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we are looking to see if is that law
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
being adhered to right now um and I I'm
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
concerned my concern I guess and maybe
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned this the fiscal as well if
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
not I will um I understand approximately
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
this is an approximate figure a huge
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
maybe 80% of our staff over a doe are
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
paid through federal dollars and we
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate the dollars for the other
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
side now I I might be off percentage one
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
way or the other and my concerns are is
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
that in your looking at this have you
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
found that there's been an effort to
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
comply with federal law and state law
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
however we're limited by the number of
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
Staff which we have over there that are
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with due process here from both
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
the federal and the state perspective
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh so did you see that you know if in
 
01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
looking at all these recommendations
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%

to further enhance our Pro practices I
 
01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
am confident that we can create a more
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
inclusive and Equitable educational
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
forward to answering some of these and
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have a really clear
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's Happening Here
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
in the field and in our office thank you
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions yes
 
01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.629 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions yes
representa

01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
representa
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you I'm thank you for being
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
here uh I'm just curious what was the
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
overall reaction with the doe when you
 
01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
saw this audit were you like shocked
 
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
were you expecting those
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
results so I think um that I I was a
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
little bit shocked because I do feel
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
like we have Pro processes and
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
procedures in place but I recognize that
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
they need to be more for formalized in a
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way that was my
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
gut thank you representative Miler thank
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and and thank you Dr Bren
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
for being here it's nice to see you here
 
01:21:44.189 --> 01:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
thank you nice to see you too I have a
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
couple questions how many staff do you
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
have in the special ed Department
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
dealing with the host kogal here that
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about investig ations
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
followup Etc then my first question is
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
how many staff do you have to cover this
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
department so this I'm just going to
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
give a general um not a specific number
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
to help you understand so in our
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
governance unit people that are
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the dispute resolution
 
01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
process which is separate from Rebecca's
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
office because we really want to keep
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the process um
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
separated from what they're doing at
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
special education to to maintain
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
maintain good relationships in the with
 
01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
our leas um so we have six is it six or
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
five D six people in our office and then
 
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
we contract with investigators that are
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
not part of our staff but they're
 
01:22:38.669 --> 01:22:38.679 align:start position:0%
contracted people and I think it's
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
either five or six the same thing with
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the um with the hearing officers and
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
then in Rebecca's staff I'm going to let
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
you do that with the monitoring because
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
then our office there's a mechanism
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's needed that when there is a
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
dispute we send it or any complaints or
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
the any of the things that you see in
 
01:22:59.470 --> 01:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
our um on that table we send it to
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
Rebecca's office so that it can be their
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
made aware of um and there's ways that
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
we need to strengthen that process but
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that she can go out and monitor the
 
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.070 align:start position:0%
so that she can go out and monitor the
elas

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
elas
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
M thank you very much thank you
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
representative Miler um we do we have
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
one staff member who does the IEP
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
facilitation um so she arranges all of
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
the facilitators who go to meetings with
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
parents and um districts and that's part
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
of her position and then we do have
 
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
monitoring we have currently nine people
 
01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:33.639 align:start position:0%
who do monitoring um we are just barely
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
started a new monitoring process we were
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
in our first round of this monitoring
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
and we are in the process of hiring one
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
individual who will Who the most of
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
their focus will be on um the
 
01:23:44.750 --> 01:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
information that comes from the
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
governance unit and then what the the
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
federal government has called um due
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
diligence reviews so if we hear a
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
complaint or we hear something from a a
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
a an outside entity we have to do our
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
due diligence and we have to determine
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
if it's a credible allegation so that is
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
something that we've been developing and
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
it currently is posted right now so
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of fulfilling that
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
position so monitoring I have people but
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for these things it would
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
be about two and a half people if you
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to one and a half people that you
 
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
want to look in my in my department
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
followup please second part
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
is representative lad earlier said that
 
01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
about 80 5% of the department staff is
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
funded through federal funds
 
01:24:30.910 --> 01:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
specifically as it relates to your
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
department how much federal funds comes
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
in and are those funds directed at the
 
01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
at Staffing or is some of that funds
 
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
directed to other department staff not
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
related to special ed needs so all of
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
our funding is either directed straight
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
to the districts um we received $54
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
Million last Year from the federal
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
government I we have not gotten our
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
allocation for this coming year so I I
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is um but a
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
majority of that funding goes directly
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
to districts and we um provide that to
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
them based on an allocation based on
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
their um this their child count and um
 
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch there's a it's a
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
formula that I could go get somebody
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
else to tell you um but we do provide
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
most of it to them and then the
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
remaining money comes to us for
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
discretionary funding or administrative
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
funding and then from um and then from
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
the state because I think that was your
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
other question we receive to to process
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
and run special education we received
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
$219,000 that does not include the
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
special education Aid money that goes
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
directly to districts or the court order
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
placement money and episod of treatment
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
money that all goes directly to
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
districts we don't use any of that money
 
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
to administer it or it's just the 219
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we use to administer um special
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
education special education Aid code
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
ordered placements and episodes of
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
treatment I may just clarify so your
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
staff is basically
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
funded primarily through federal funds
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
but the investigative piece is federal
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
is funded through state is that correct
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
So currently what we use our federal
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
funding for for salaries is um it pays
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
for 20% of my salary it pays for one
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
staff member who oversees um special
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
education Aid court ordered placements
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
and episodes of treatment it pays for
 
01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
three clerks that come in and assist us
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
with processing special education Aid
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
because it is a very short timeline to
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
do that we do that between July 30th and
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
December 1st so they come in for just
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
that amount of time and then it helps to
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
play pay for um part of the due process
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
hearing costs it does not pay for all of
 
01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
it it pays for just part of it thank you
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
represent Harry and then representative
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:46.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
um when we look at the um the
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
observations and we look at the
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations and then we note that in
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of uh the instances
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
that is with respect to the observations
 
01:27:02.109 --> 01:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
and recommendations that the department
 
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
concurs or partially concurs um that in
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
and of itself I think raises some very
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
uh interesting
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
questions but um those aside for the
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
moment uh let me let me ask you uh two
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
questions one do you feel that with
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
respect to your
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh concurrence and partial concurrence
 
01:27:30.109 --> 01:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
expertise to be able to
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
implement the um the recommendations
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
that have been made at least to the
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
extent that you agree with
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
them and then secondly um a very
 
01:27:50.669 --> 01:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
specific question um with regard to the
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
concern about unregulated agreement
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
contents and the
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
I believe you heard the extensive
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
comments that were made by
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli with respect to
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements would would as
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
I note the nhed response on pages 100
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
and 1001 I don't find that there is uh
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
any content here that addresses the
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
concern raised in the recommendation
 
01:28:22.229 --> 01:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
with respect to the non-disclosure
 
01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
agreements which um very unsettling and
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
and troubling so if you could answer
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
those two questions the first is do you
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
believe you have the expertise to be
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
able to work on these uh recommendations
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
to the extent that you agree with them
 
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
and then number two um the lack of there
 
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
being any response um to the concern
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
raised about the non-disclosure
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
agreements in your resp Department's
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
response on pages 100 and 101 but would
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
you please address uh for us now um what
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
your response would be to the troubling
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
aspects that are raised with respect to
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
non-disclosure agreements thanks sure
 
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to start and then
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand it over to my attorney
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
as well um so yes we have the expertise
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that for for um as far as
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
why we concur I um many I think that um
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
with with many of these audit findings
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
we saw how we can strengthen our program
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
and they found things that and unveiled
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
things that maybe we didn't recognize at
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
the time so yes we have the expertise
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
we'll be using Cadre another resource
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we'll be using the federal um
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
government's technical assistance so yes
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
I think that we have the expertise we
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
have wonderful stakeholders with um um
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
pick and our Advocates so I feel very
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
confident that we can come to Great
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
agreement to make some of these things
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
happen um the second um part of your
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
question is sort of a two part we had
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
really robust conversations with the
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
Auditors about our authority of what we
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
can impose on the leas and historically
 
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
the department has not really played
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
that role and we have to be very careful
 
01:30:12.109 --> 01:30:12.119 align:start position:0%
as we move forward because we have to
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that that we have the
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
resources and that we're not jamming up
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
the system so that there aren't Les
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
resolutions and Diana would you mind
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
continuing with
 
01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.430 align:start position:0%
continuing with
that

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
so uh good morning for the record Diana
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
Fenton um you know the non-disclosure
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
agreements has been a source of concern
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
for the Department um and I will
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
reiterate what what the Deputy
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner just said is that
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
historically this is a role the
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
department has not played and it was a
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
refreshing robust conversation with the
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
Auditors when it was brought to the
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
Department's attention that the
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
department really does have more
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
authority to enforce at the local level
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
than historically we had been led to
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe that being said the department
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
has to be mindful as we take on that new
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
role that we don't open ourselves up to
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
any liability recognizing that these are
 
01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
two-party agreements and if the
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
department were to suddenly impose
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
itself it could become a three-party
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
agreement and so anything we do in that
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
area um we need to just do it in a
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
mindful process and so we will be
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
working with the Attorney General's
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
office who is our legal counsel to make
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't cause unnecessary
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
problems but the non-disclosure
 
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
agreements is something that has
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
troubled not only this legislative body
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
but the department has been very aware
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
of and very concerned about and it's
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
nice to for the Department to know that
 
01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
there are Avenues by which they can be
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
addressed representa
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
cascaden uh thank you uh Mr chair thank
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um I I guess
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think in Big Picture
 
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
numbers whether dispute resolution
 
01:32:03.149 --> 01:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
processes have
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
been um more have been requested more
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
often or has it been pretty consistent
 
01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
over the years I don't know if you know
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
from like say for the last 10 years or
 
01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:19.719 align:start position:0%
has there been a spike of an increase or
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
a decrease or how are we with numbers
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
manageable thank you for the question um
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's interesting when you have
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
audit findings going back to 1991 and
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
1999 these processes have existed in
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
some form for a long time and they've
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
changed over time they have morphed um
 
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully they've morph to address the
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
needs that are being
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
seen um
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that recently we have
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
seen an uptick in in the numbers um and
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
I can certainly get you that those exact
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
numbers but I think part of it is an
 
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:10.109 align:start position:0%
numbers but I think part of it is an
interplay

01:33:10.109 --> 01:33:10.119 align:start position:0%
interplay
 
01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:13.159 align:start position:0%
with getting the information out to the
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
field to the leas to parents the
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
communication keeping those lines of
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
communication open and then being
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
responsive to those needs and so we have
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
seen an an uptick in
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
those just over the last I would say 3
 
01:33:30.239 --> 01:33:31.830 align:start position:0%
those just over the last I would say 3
four

01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
years and of course you know I have to
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
put a caveat on everything the numbers
 
01:33:39.590 --> 01:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic threw off those
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
statistics right and then we're seeing a
 
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
response to that and so when we look at
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
it historically we have to keep in mind
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
what was happening kind of society if
 
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
you will um because we have seen a
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
response to
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you repr
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair um uh
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
Dr brenon I I have um immense respect
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
for you and many in in the department
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
but I I honestly I was really surprised
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
by your statement because it seems to
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
contradict the um the the findings and
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations U that are laid out in
 
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
the um in the audit report and my my
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
question to you is um
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
do does does the does the department
 
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
recognize the gravity of of the findings
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
um that are that are in here
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
and how do you square statements like
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
calling some of these things
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
shortcomings um when when there are
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
there are you know findings in the
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
report that say you know things like and
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
this is a quote NH
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
could not provide reasonable Assurance
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh could could not provide reasonable
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
Assurance the rights of children with
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities and their parents were
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
protected and um and I I guess what I'm
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
asking you is is could you could you
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
convince me that that the department um
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
serious thank you so much for your
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
question which page did you find that on
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
on what response that's at the top of 94
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
top of 94 um so um first of all we do
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
take these audit reports this is my
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
second um audit with the LBA um working
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
when we had one with vocational rehab
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I find that these tools are a way
 
01:35:43.629 --> 01:35:43.639 align:start position:0%
for us to improve and to get better um I
 
01:35:46.149 --> 01:35:46.159 align:start position:0%
think we have 33,000 students with
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
special education um that have an IEP I
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
think when we look at some of the um
 
01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.470 align:start position:0%
think when we look at some of the um
responses

01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
responses
 
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know I think that the Auditors did a
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
fantastic job but to only think that 25
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
25 people responded to the parent survey
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
and 25 um special Educators responded to
 
01:36:09.790 --> 01:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
the audit when we have about
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
172 um I want to I want to make sure
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
that it's um that it's I just think that
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's an important fact to be looking
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
at this when we when we look at the
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
audit but I think that we want to have
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
continuous Improvement and we want to
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're doing that so this
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
is a tool to get us there I'm going to
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
just follow up on where Ripon luno was
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm concerned real concerned
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
with this cost tracking and
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
controls uh with our dealing with our
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
contractors and on page
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
61 the there this was alluded to
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
contractor payment controls were
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
inadequate and insufficient to reduce
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
possible I won't put the word to reduce
 
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:54.669 align:start position:0%
possible I won't put the word to reduce
fraud

01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
risk then I'm looking down on the bottom
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
of that page two com two of these uh
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
contractor payment transactions two
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
conflicted with documentation and case
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
records indicating invoiced work did not
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
occur resulting in potentially
 
01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:12.430 align:start position:0%
occur resulting in potentially
fraudulent

01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
fraudulent
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
payments have we identified fraud going
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
on there there is no fraud that's
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
happening with our hearing officers um
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
that was a technical error and we have
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
already worked with our office of
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
Business Administration to rectify our
 
01:37:31.950 --> 01:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
invoicing process and our and have had
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
meetings with our vendors on how um the
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
internal um how the invoicing must
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
go and I think that we are also working
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
with our attorney to make sure that our
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
contracts are better uh more well
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
written and do you receive the invoice
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
to work from the contractor for for
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
payment yes and we make sure that now
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
that the deliverables that are in the
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
contract are on the invoice and I can
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
get you a sample of the kind of invoices
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
or receipts documentation do that okay I
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm believing what you're saying
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
I just just want to make sure we're not
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
going down a path we don't want to go
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
down yeah that was um I think when um
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the senator asked me that was my first
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
reaction of oh my Lord this cannot be
 
01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
true but that was the first thing that
 
01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
we addressed and it was minor um and
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
we've reviewed many others after um the
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
auditor shared this information with us
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
so I feel 100% confident that there is
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
no fraud or um payments that for not for
 
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
work not being done and are those
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
payments paid in the fiscal year in
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
which they're doing this or is it
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
carried over where we had the issue with
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
the $122,000 yeah those are some of the
 
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that we are making of when the
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
um hearing officers need what's their
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
period of performance because what what
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
happens is some of these cases are going
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
on for a long time and we really want to
 
01:39:01.709 --> 01:39:01.719 align:start position:0%
try to shorten that process so that kids
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
can get the services over a thousand
 
01:39:04.679 --> 01:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
can get the services over a thousand
days

01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
y yeah represent Terry and then
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
represent Miler it it appear to follow
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
on it it appears as though you you
 
01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
addressed that in your response on page
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
64 the question that's been put to you
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
by chairman lad but as you as you do so
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
in the second in the one
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
two three four paragraph beginning be
 
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:35.310 align:start position:0%
two three four paragraph beginning be
bses

01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
bses
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
currently the second sentence Begins the
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
governance unit will modify hearing
 
01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:41.149 align:start position:0%
governance unit will modify hearing
officer

01:39:41.149 --> 01:39:41.159 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
contracts can you uh since that language
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
has been submitted to the Auditors have
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
you done so and if not what's the
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
this so
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
wait yeah I see where you're I'm just I
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
just want to read the governance unit
 
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
will modify hearing officer contracts to
 
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
require invoice be submitted to
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
nhed with dot dot dot so where are you
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
in the process of modifying the hearing
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
officer contracts since this verbiage
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
has been included in the auditor report
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
have you done so are you doing so and if
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
you haven't completed this um this
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
commitment when do you expect to
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
complete it well the invoices have been
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
completed um and we're and we are we're
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
talking about contracts now oh the the
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
contracts okay the government's unit
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
will modify hearing officer contracts to
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
require so when I'm not sure of the
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
timeline on the contracts but they are
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
typically three-year contracts and so
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
when that contract comes up again it
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
would be modified to include that
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
language so that is something that the
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
the person who oversees that contract
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
will be working on and will be doing we
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
initially wanted to make sure that the
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
invoicing was done right away so that we
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
could ensure that we were getting
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
correct payments and there was no um
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for fraud so the contracts
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
will be worked on oh yes so if the
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
contracts uh if if you're pointing to a
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
date in the future with respect to the
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
language being modified is there
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
anything that you can do in the room to
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
ensure that this is taking place before
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
you formalize it in contractual language
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
or are do we have to wait for this I
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
think that there's opportunity for us to
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
amend the contract but I believe and I
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to um give in incorrect
 
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
information but I think we are at the
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
very end of the three-year contract with
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.790 --> 01:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
officers per on IA thank you Mr chair
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of other questions obviously
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
you've had a chance to review this
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
report Etc and one of the key issues
 
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
here obviously is uh the relationship
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
between the department and the local
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
school districts and the U knowledge of
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
those at the Lea level uh in
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
understanding what the responsibilities
 
01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.350 align:start position:0%
understanding what the responsibilities
are

01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
Etc as as report throughout the report
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
it talks about the need to make sure
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
that there is an understanding of what
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
the respon responsibilities are so my
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
question to you is based upon the report
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
in your review uh what plans do you have
 
01:42:35.229 --> 01:42:35.239 align:start position:0%
to upscale and enhance the training uh
 
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
of local uh special ed uh directors for
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
example to make sure that there is
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
compliance uh with the elements that are
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
in this report that's my first question
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a a great question so
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I think what um some of our plans are
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
for making sure that the leas understand
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
the dispute um resolution process we
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
have Partners like pic that help educate
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
them we do trainings ourselves around
 
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
the state which we will now enhance and
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
make it more systematic and um more
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
systematic so and in a in a policy so
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
that it's ensured to continuously happen
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
um right now we have to make sure that
 
01:43:19.990 --> 01:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
our leas are telling the parents at the
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
meetings what their options are um and
 
01:43:25.709 --> 01:43:25.719 align:start position:0%
as far as the dispute resolution happens
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
and what choices that they have um so
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're one of the um we met with one of
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
our Advocates who had um an idea of when
 
01:43:38.229 --> 01:43:38.239 align:start position:0%
a we already recognize that when a
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
dispute or when a parent does not agree
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
with an IEP it's documented in nessus
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
and we know that there's um it's
 
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
partially reject partially you're going
 
01:43:51.550 --> 01:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
to have to get the terminology correct
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
but we have this information we have
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
this data we can run reports um and so
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
now we need to look at a systematic
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
approach of how often do we run the
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
report how many parents what districts
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
are maybe continuously having dispute
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
resolution processes we have to start
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
analyzing that kind of data and then
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
coming up with a good implementation
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
process um so that the leas understand
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
the process and the parents do two two
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
follow-ups please so do you have a
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
schedule for these training are these
 
01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
are these episodic based upon your
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
definition of what needs to be done at a
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
particular School District level so is
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
there a training schedule for this that
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
you've you've developed or what so we've
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
always had trainings but I think again
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
we need to formalizing and when we were
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
doing the trainings before it was kind
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
of um reactive to what were issues that
 
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
were going in in the field but now I
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have a formalized
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh training schedule that will be posted
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
um we'll make sure that our contractors
 
01:44:54.629 --> 01:44:54.639 align:start position:0%
know it we'll make sure our stakeholders
 
01:44:54.639 --> 01:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
know it we'll make sure our stakeholders
know

01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:44:59.149 --> 01:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
it when is that schedule to be posted I
 
01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't have an exact timeline but I'll
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
make sure um I think one of the Senators
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
said who's um how do we know that these
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
things are getting completed but we have
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
to go to fiscal I think it's quarterly
 
01:45:13.229 --> 01:45:13.239 align:start position:0%
and give updates on some of the reports
 
01:45:16.350 --> 01:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure um that those that those
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
schedules will be included and that
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
information will be shared my final
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
question is that as you as you look at
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
your step staing in your
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
department is it is it a correct
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
assumption that when you hire somebody
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
in that department that they have field
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
experience that they've been a director
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
of special ed for example at a school
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
district level that they in fact
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
understand the law that they're not just
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
a casual specialed person but they have
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
an in depth knowledge about what's going
 
01:45:50.669 --> 01:45:50.679 align:start position:0%
on yeah that's one of the um when we
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
interview people for positions that's um
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
one of the expectations and sometimes um
 
01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
there have been parents that know the
 
01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
process um the Ed IEP process really
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
well and understand all of the laws and
 
01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
processes as well thank you thank you we
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
have a number of recommendations made by
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
LBA six of which may require
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and we're hanging on to S SP
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
340 right now and 443 340 is dealing
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
directly with
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
IEPs and 443 deals with transportation
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
services for special education
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
youngsters um do you have you've had
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
this report for a bit here now are there
 
01:46:37.629 --> 01:46:37.639 align:start position:0%
any areas in which you have some
 
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions for legislation right now
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we could tack on I Can Only Hold on
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
these bills for at least another 30 days
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
and then they're out is there do we want
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
to use these bills as an Avenue to
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
trying to rectify some whether your your
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
needs so I mentioned the two bills that
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
we will need your support in to fix some
 
01:47:00.350 --> 01:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
of the confusion about the statutory
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
requirements but I'm going to let my
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
teammates talk about the transportation
 
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
go yeah thank you for that opportunity
 
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
so we do have the current house bills uh
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
that were brought forward in response to
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
the audit findings um I think we do have
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to look at those Senate
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
bills to see if there's some areas that
 
01:47:24.910 --> 01:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
we can be addressed uh I think that when
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
we look at these audit
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
findings we have to look at them in
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
terms of the department as a whole and
 
01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
be very mindful in terms of our
 
01:47:38.229 --> 01:47:38.239 align:start position:0%
implementation and and I go back to the
 
01:47:40.629 --> 01:47:40.639 align:start position:0%
comment that was raised about um our
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
oversight and our work with the with the
 
01:47:45.589 --> 01:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
leas I think that's a really important
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
area it is an area that is
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
um has a lot of opportunity and I think
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
it does does need to be looked at very
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
carefully again I go back to the
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
language in the audit report that the
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
Auditors we had a very robust discussion
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
with the Auditors about the Department's
 
01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
oversight of the laas and historically
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
the department has not acted in that
 
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
capacity and so as we look into this
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
area which is filled with opportunity uh
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
I would just want to do so very
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
carefully so that the department does
 
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
not open it up itself up to liab ility
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
um but that would be the area that I
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
would suggest we look at and this
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislative body look at for those two
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
retained Senate bills I think that is a
 
01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:35.719 align:start position:0%
great area to start and we appreciate
 
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
that opportunity thank you representer
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman Dr BR thank
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
you for for being here and I I I
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
recognize as representative Miler and
 
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
luno did year competency and the
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
leadership and the expertise you bring
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the the department I appreciate that
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
but I need to say I agree with u
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative luno as I heard the last
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
two or three minutes of your opening
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
statement it's just it didn't resonate
 
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
well with me thinking that we have well
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
over 75% of these 20 that you that your
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
department agreed with of issues that
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
are that are uh non-compliant and in in
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
Era and you close with in my in my
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
perception well everything's fine we're
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
doing well and we're on track and that's
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
how it came to me like uh it just didn't
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
resonate well because I don't think
 
01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
everything's fine I don't think
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
everything's well I don't everything's
 
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
on track and this just supports that and
 
01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
this is only a two-year picture and I
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know we look at so I just I I just I
 
01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that I have total
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
faith in you but I just was taking a
 
01:49:47.550 --> 01:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
step back listening to that closing well
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and um you know I am an
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
educator so I do see the um glass half
 
01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's um I I apologize if
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't uh appear that I'm taking
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
this serious or um I think that the
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
audit has pinpointed some areas that we
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
need to improve and need to work on and
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm um excited that we have the tool to
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
make it better um but I do recognize
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
that there are there were some
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
deficiencies that they put it they put
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
out there but I think that um overall we
 
01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
have um done my team has done a great
 
01:50:26.669 --> 01:50:26.679 align:start position:0%
job making sure that people understand
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
this very very complicated process and
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize like I said if it was I
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you thank you Mr
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you rep
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much uh Mr chair I
 
01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
want to sort of go back to um uh an area
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's you know clearly within
 
01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
the within the Department's um uh
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
framework and it's observation 8 which
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative lad was referring to
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
earlier that were
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
questioning whether or not the
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
department had um adequate Financial
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
controls and so this starts on page 60
 
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
but there's a there's a response from
 
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
the Department on the bottom of 64 that
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
that reads um so the the department
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
concurs in part with the recommendations
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
and so the response on the bottom of 64
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
reads um nhed will assess the need to
 
01:51:19.629 --> 01:51:19.639 align:start position:0%
develop additional internal controls and
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
update existing policies and procedures
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
relating to the following contract
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
development identification of fraud risk
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
improper pay payments ability to recoup
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
costs for any identified improper
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
contract payments and contractor
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
payments in the appropriate um um uh
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year I how is the department
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to could you sort of talk about
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
how the department will go about doing
 
01:51:45.069 --> 01:51:45.079 align:start position:0%
that assessing the uh the need to
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
develop additional Financial controls
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I think right now we have a
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
very um wonderful CFO
 
01:51:55.950 --> 01:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
at our department who oversees um our
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
business office and she can review um
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
some of the processes that we have in
 
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
place and give make sure that they are
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible and that the
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
internal controls are there um and then
 
01:52:13.310 --> 01:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
but what are they going to look at how
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
are they going to how are they going to
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
assess the
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
need assess the need for more internal
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
to develop additional internal control
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
controls well I mean I think that that's
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
a fiscal responsibility um and that
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
we'll be working with our fiscal team to
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that those happen I'm not a
 
01:52:33.669 --> 01:52:33.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal expert but I I have full
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
confidence on our team um at the OBM
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
you representative luno if I may add to
 
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
that um I believe that the department of
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
administrative Services also has further
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
oversight on those fiscal controls and I
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
think those are policies that are always
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
being developed I'm not directly
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
involved in that process I personally
 
01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:01.719 align:start position:0%
struggle to get my travel reimbursement
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
done correctly um but my understanding
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
from my years of employment at the
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
department and and within the state is
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
that that is an area that is beyond just
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
the governance unit or the Department of
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
Education something that the state is
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
constantly looking to work at um fraud
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
risk concerns all of us
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of the audit findings that's
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
always an issue and so it's kind of an
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
interplay between the office the
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
Department's fiscal Bureau and Das and
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
how that all works together but it is an
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
area that's constantly being uh worked
 
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
on so it's kind of our thoughts on it
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
but it's a much bigger picture follow up
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
on that Mr chair yes I yes than how how
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
does the the administrative Services
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
know when to get involved in uh in that
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
type of um
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
um you know fraud mitigation policy
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
review um assessing uh whether fraud uh
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
has has happened how does das know when
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
to get involved in
 
01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm a little out of my depth on
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
that I've never worked for das um some
 
01:54:19.149 --> 01:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
of it is just kind of anecdotal from
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
State Employment experience um I think
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
that there's two pieces to it there's
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
when fraud has occurred and that's not
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with here that's not
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion um and then there's just
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
the constant being proactive to address
 
01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
potential fraud risk
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
um it's important that state government
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of what department you're
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
talking about remain being proactive
 
01:54:45.790 --> 01:54:45.800 align:start position:0%
rather than reactive I think that's
 
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
always a struggle for state government
 
01:54:51.229 --> 01:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
and so I think just in terms of state
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
government as a whole
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
that is obviously a concern for everyone
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
here um and how do we make sure that our
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
technology our policies our practices
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
and our procedures are always one step
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
ahead to mitigate identify and detect
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
any fraud risk one final one final
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
followup on that this section
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
specifically relates to um to
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
contractors so so wondering will will
 
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
will uh Department of um administrative
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
Services as well as uh New Hampshire
 
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
education be able to um to um to assess
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
what the fraud risk is and whether fraud
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
has been um uh uh exists I guess whether
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
fraud has been committed uh uh when when
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
involved and thank you for the question
 
01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.109 align:start position:0%
involved and thank you for the question
representative

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
Leno I want to be clear there was no
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
fraud there are areas however where the
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
department can be stronger in protecting
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
against fraud and identifying fraud risk
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
and that is important to the department
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
it's important to our
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
constituents and when we look at our
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
contract and our contract language we
 
01:56:11.709 --> 01:56:11.719 align:start position:0%
will always look to strengthen that
 
01:56:11.719 --> 01:56:12.950 align:start position:0%
will always look to strengthen that
particular

01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:56:14.990 --> 01:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
area and we'll work with the Attorney
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
General's office when we look at those
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
contracts to see where we can strengthen
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you very much yeah
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a number of contracts in other
 
01:56:26.950 --> 01:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
areas you know like minimum standards
 
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
for public school approval which we've
 
01:56:30.629 --> 01:56:30.639 align:start position:0%
contacted with retired
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
superintendents some of those reports
 
01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:34.830 align:start position:0%
superintendents some of those reports
are

01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
sloppy and you know done on a piece of
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
paper and there it is and here's your 12
 
01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
grand for that report I think that's
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is tighten up our
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
reporting to ensure that it's specific
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and it answers the questions that you're
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:56:54.629 --> 01:56:54.639 align:start position:0%
um I I've looked at a number of those
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
others and I was appalled that I don't
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
think you're doing that anymore I think
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
that contracted service has been stopped
 
01:57:05.390 --> 01:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
but uh I agree this somewhere we have to
 
01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:09.639 align:start position:0%
work on um are there any other questions
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
from the committee right now represent
 
01:57:14.189 --> 01:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
BR go ahead represent Amon thank you Mr
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
question so broad
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
picture does the department as it is
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
currently staffed and funded have the
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
capacity to efficiently
 
01:57:38.229 --> 01:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
audit you want
 
01:57:43.149 --> 01:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
us um I think that we would have to do
 
01:57:46.589 --> 01:57:46.599 align:start position:0%
um a more comprehensive assessment of um
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
some of the um some of the things that
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
we found here to be able to answer that
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
question at this time depending on um
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
what route the legislation takes and
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
some of the things that they found in
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
here um for example using more of our
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
Authority in working with the
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
alas follow
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:58:17.069 --> 01:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
um far more of the recommendations than
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
not are not identified as having
 
01:58:22.990 --> 01:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
legislative involvement or potential
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
Solutions or
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
approaches so I would ask
 
01:58:34.030 --> 01:58:34.040 align:start position:0%
for some sense of
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
timeline in the we don't know if it's 45
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
or 90 days 45 is really not very many or
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
the quarterly reporting when the
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
department would be able
 
01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
to say we have the resources to do this
 
01:58:52.229 --> 01:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
or we need these kinds of resources and
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
I realize this is a big picture
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensive question but it's the it's
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of what the outcome
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
of this is not just a report sitting on
 
01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.709 align:start position:0%
of this is not just a report sitting on
a

01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
shelf exactly um it would be helpful for
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
us to come back after we have our
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
training with um the NC National Center
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
of improvement um systematic Improvement
 
01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
this summer our whole team is going to
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
this along with some of the special ed
 
01:59:21.679 --> 01:59:23.390 align:start position:0%
this along with some of the special ed
folks

01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:59:26.510 --> 01:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
and we're bringing our documents to get
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
great technical assistance and I think
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have a very comprehensive picture
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
of what our dispute resolution process
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
will look like and then we can be able
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
to communicate it out and make sure that
 
01:59:38.790 --> 01:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
we have all the resources that are
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
needed we look forward to that thank you
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further further
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
represent Hall maybe it's not a question
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
but thank you um first of all I taught
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
special editor was an Lea and this
 
01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
report gives me high anxiety I mean high
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
anxiety I I guess I would like to thank
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
kind of in response to representative
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
Damon that the fix here and there a lot
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
of fixes is not going to be to hire more
 
02:00:08.109 --> 02:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
people you may end up hiring more people
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
but I hope that's not where it's going
 
02:00:13.069 --> 02:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
to start um so that that's a concern I
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
have about there always seems to be a
 
02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:17.719 align:start position:0%
fix with hiring people and I don't think
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's the case thank you thank
 
02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
that's the case thank you thank
you

02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
I think the legislature sometimes has to
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
look in the mirror
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
ourselves um we had a request come in
 
02:00:30.669 --> 02:00:30.679 align:start position:0%
from the Department last year for an
 
02:00:35.069 --> 02:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
analyst to work with uh Caitlyn Davis
 
02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
and one of our committees rejected it
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
came out of this committee
 
02:00:44.350 --> 02:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh so it's uh it'd be nice
 
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
to see what your priorities are in terms
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
of staffing needs um for a lot of areas
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions from
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
the committee here not so I want to
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank the department for thank you
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
coming forward and and trying to respond
 
02:01:01.229 --> 02:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
to some of our questions and and thank

baileywick

02:01:24.069 --> 02:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
Kristen monani Office of the advocate
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
for special
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
education um I'm not going to speak for
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
long but uh I did read the report as
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
soon as it came out it was not
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
surprising um I seen many of those
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
things in the past six plus months seven
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
months eight months
 
02:01:46.270 --> 02:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
representing um the interest of parents
 
02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
uh I would say some things I I have sat
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
down um with the Department um on a few
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
occasions prior but since this report
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
came out and we have
 
02:01:58.830 --> 02:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
discussed where some of those fixes
 
02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
should start I think one of the things
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to do is group some
 
02:02:03.310 --> 02:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
of these recommendations and
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
observations um but you're always going
 
02:02:08.589 --> 02:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
to hear me talk in specifics and not
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
generalizations to just to address by
 
02:02:13.390 --> 02:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
way of example a couple of the things
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
that have come up um representative luno
 
02:02:18.189 --> 02:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
for example asked a question about
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
timelines um and it goes to all of your
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
broad question about the department
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
concurring in part um with these
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations and so I would say to
 
02:02:30.589 --> 02:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
use a timeline specific question but it
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
goes to so many of these issues what I
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
see is that the department
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
is um complying with federal regulations
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and really making good efforts in
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
the sense that there is a process when a
 
02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
parent files for due process they get a
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
very way well laid out statement of here
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
are your timelines here's your hearing
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
officer here are the the dates on which
 
02:02:54.669 --> 02:02:54.679 align:start position:0%
all of these things will happen and they
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
are compliant with the statutes and
 
02:02:59.870 --> 02:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
regulations I think some of the issue
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
throughout this report and I I don't
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
know I haven't discussed this
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
specifically with the department but the
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
concurrence in part would be uh there's
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
not great tracking later on um and it
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's not happening because
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
my experience with the hearing officers
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
is that they are holding those timelines
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're very conscious of them so it
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we're so far off for
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
the majority on all of those timelines
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's that the tracking um
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
retrospectively of what happened in each
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
case isn't necessarily there um
 
02:03:32.189 --> 02:03:32.199 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli asked about
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
nessus versus other databases being kept
 
02:03:36.069 --> 02:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
by the department I I think that really
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
is an issue to look at how much
 
02:03:40.589 --> 02:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
information could we get out of nessus
 
02:03:41.669 --> 02:03:41.679 align:start position:0%
that the department could start
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
incorporating into its um oversight and
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
we have had that conversation in the P
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
last week in fact um and then once
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're doing some of that providing
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
some technical guidance to the leas
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
looking at information that's available
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
across the 30,000 student population
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
starting a big picture report there and
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
then funneling it down to better
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
reporting on the tracking of of the
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
honestly small area of dispute
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
resolution right because of the 30,000
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
special ed cases as you've correctly
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
pointed out there are two sides there's
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
another audit you know only a small
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
portion of them go to dispute resolution
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think the better tracking
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
of some of those questions is really um
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
as overwhelming as it might appear
 
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
initially and it's certainly something
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
we're discussing in terms of
 
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations because the more we
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
track the more we understand really the
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
problem and we understand where more
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
oversight is needed um from the
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
Department to the leas uh my office is
 
02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be making
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations has already about some
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
um technical advisories we'd love to see
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
coming from the Department to leas on
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
some of these points because it is true
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
that a lot of them do not know um some
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the compliance pieces that they're
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be ensuring at the local
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
level um it's come
 
02:05:08.589 --> 02:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
up frequently in the past month actually
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
and talking about some of the findings
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
of this this audit but definitely
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
working I look forward to working in
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
collaboration and um I think we'll find
 
02:05:20.830 --> 02:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the problems are more about
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
tracking and reporting and those those
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
metrics and that once that is done
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
better we'll have a better idea of how
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
much is substance and how much is kind
 
02:05:35.270 --> 02:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the reporting
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
processes that are at issue thank you
 
02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno thank you Mr chair
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
and thanks thanks for sharing some some
 
02:05:48.549 --> 02:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
some thoughts um on this I I was
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
wondering in in um in your experience
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
how how how are we doing in New
 
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compared with other states
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
like I don't know Massachusetts New
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
Jersey you know pick a
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
few and I'm talking and I'm talking
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
about in terms of not just the number of
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
complaints I mean we're at around 1% I
 
02:06:10.549 --> 02:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
think just looking at the numbers um but
 
02:06:13.549 --> 02:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
but the processes in general and and you
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
know things like
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
that we could tighten up some of the
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
processes um representative cordelli
 
02:06:21.119 --> 02:06:22.149 align:start position:0%
processes um representative cordelli
indicated

02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
um the tracking for example of Parental
 
02:06:29.709 --> 02:06:29.719 align:start position:0%
refusals partial refusals or partial
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
consents depending on how you look at it
 
02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
but that's going to matter in terms of
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
how we track it in the data whether we
 
02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
track it as a partial refusal or partial
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
consent um those that the reporting of
 
02:06:44.549 --> 02:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
those help us understand okay well let's
 
02:06:46.709 --> 02:06:46.719 align:start position:0%
say only 1% are going to any kind of
 
02:06:49.549 --> 02:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
complaint or dispute
 
02:06:53.310 --> 02:06:53.320 align:start position:0%
resolution how should we look at that um
 
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
if we have high levels of refusals then
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a good thing if 1% are going
 
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
but that's the kind of data that we've
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
been discussing that we don't seem to
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
have readily available and clean just
 
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
yet that I think is doesn't have to be a
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
particularly difficult fix it's one of
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
the areas that I would like my office to
 
02:07:14.109 --> 02:07:14.119 align:start position:0%
focus on in collaboration with the
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
Department because then we would be able
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
to better um answer your question
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
tracking refusals um some other states
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
are doing it much better honestly
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
parents refuse their IEP and they get
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
from um the bureaus of dispute
 
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
resolution whatever they are termed in
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
that state pretty quickly a letter we
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
understand youve refused here's a guide
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
here's how you go about pursuing those
 
02:07:41.790 --> 02:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
rights so in that case I think you would
 
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
probably find there are fewer sitting
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
getting stale you know disputes or IEPs
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
where students are not getting Services
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
over a long period of time because
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
parents may not feel empowered to
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
bring a case to a resolution and in some
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
instances we have to provide leas with
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
the advice that it is their
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility to bring some of these
 
02:08:04.589 --> 02:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
cases to resolution under the law and
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's not happening in some instances
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
where you could really say the laa
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right to just sit on
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
this dispute If the parents weren't
 
02:08:14.549 --> 02:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
bringing it they needed to it had to be
 
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
resolved in some manner so that's also a
 
02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
place where I'm um my office will be
 
02:08:22.510 --> 02:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
working uh I hope that answers your
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
question do would agree further
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much appreciate
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you okay with uh hearing now
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
from the special Advocate the department
 
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
and the LBA we want to thank people and
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%

you very much and with that we're going
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%

my

02:09:07.069 --> 02:09:07.079 align:start position:0%

well

02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
yeah
