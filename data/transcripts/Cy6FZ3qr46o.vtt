00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Cassandra
 
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
Levesque and I represent Stratford for
 
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
hb33 is about raising awareness for
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
polycystic ovary syndrome also known as
 
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.690 align:start position:0%
polycystic ovary syndrome also known as
PCOS

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
PCOS
 
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
it is a hormonal condition that can be
 
00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
treated with medication PCOS is
 
00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 align:start position:0%
different for everyone the most common
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
factor leading to a diagnosis is an
 
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
irregular period
 
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
it affects 1 in 10 women more than 5
 
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
million women may be affected in the U.S
 
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.410 align:start position:0%
million women may be affected in the U.S
alone

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
alone
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
it can occur in girls as young as 11
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
and the exact cause of PCOS is unclear
 
00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 align:start position:0%
there's a set of tests that can be done
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
to determine if you have PCOS every
 
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
woman that I have talked to that is
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
living with PCOS
 
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
they all experience different effects
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
for some it can be very painful for
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
others they may go without their period
 
00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 align:start position:0%
for months or others have not had their
 
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
period at all
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm living with polycystic ovary
 
00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 align:start position:0%
syndrome and even though I am being
 
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
treated with medication it is still
 
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 align:start position:0%
excruciatingly painful
 
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
awareness of PCOS can help so many women
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
and girls to know about the effects and
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
as a society we can dedicate more effort
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
to advocacy education
 
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
and research
 
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 align:start position:0%
some of the complications of polycystic
 
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
ovary syndrome are infertility
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
when I bring this up to other women many
 
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
do not know what it is and some may not
 
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
realize they have it
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
I definitely did not know what it was
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
until my doctor discussed it with me
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
it affects everyone differently and just
 
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
having this discussion is important
 
00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
despite the prevalence of the complex
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
chronic condition one-third of women
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with PCOS saw at least three
 
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals over the
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
course of two years
 
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
before receiving a diagnosis according
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
to a study from the Perlman school of
 
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 align:start position:0%

Pennsylvania
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
women with PCOS have greater chances of
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
developing several serious health

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
the risk of a heart attack is four to
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
seven times higher than women with PCOS
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
than women of the same age without PCOS
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
women with PCOS are at greater risk of
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
having high blood pressure
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
women with PCOS have high levels of LDL

maybe today maybe tomorrow there may be
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
a girl who is wondering why her period
 
00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 align:start position:0%
seems so different than her friends or a
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
woman who may be wondering why she
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't gotten her period
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
educating and talking about this can
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
help women go from risking their health
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
over medicating over the counter with
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
information and care that they need
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%

representative blackis thank you
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand correctly your
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
main goal is to
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
make potential sufferers of this aware
 
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
that the the issue exists so they can
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
try and get proper treatment is that
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
correct yes and follow-up follow-up
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
um do not primary care doctors and other
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
doctors are they not aware of it and if
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in with problems is this
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
something they don't diagnose for some
 
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:55.309 align:start position:0%
something they don't diagnose for some
reason

00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh some of the women that have gotten
 
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
diagnosed they go in at an early age
 
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
with their pediatrician sometimes and
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician just chocks it up to
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
their period right going and them out
 
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:10.580 align:start position:0%

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
um you know adding another of the I
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
think there's over 28 of these in there
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
is not an effective way to raise
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
awareness is my concern because
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
basically what happens is on the the
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
particular day the governors
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
um staff prepares this
 
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
Proclamation and he signs it and there's
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
probably a press release and that's
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
generally it
 
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740 align:start position:0%
and if you go around and look at the
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
whole list of them and you talk to
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
people in the state most people have no
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
idea that any of these things exist and
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
so it's really not effective and I think
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
you know a more effective way of
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
raising awareness is having people you
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
know put together an event you know have
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
a uh you know talk to the Press get a
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
press conference maybe get information
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
out to medical professionals maybe get
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
information out you know posted or
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
something in the schools and if you want
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
official recognition if you get a
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
petition from some people asking the
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
governor to make a proclamation he's
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
almost certainly going to do it
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
but it's it's you know a Grassroots
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
effort by some group of people to try
 
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:06.380 align:start position:0%
and raise awareness
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
is is more effective and I think the
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
greatest risk of putting observances in
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
statute is that you know once the people
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the issue get a bill
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
through they think they're done they've
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
accomplished something but really
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
they've accomplished nothing effective
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
to raise awareness and you know I'm
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
concerned that you know this is a
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
problem and and people do need to be
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
aware about it especially the people
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
that are you know are vulnerable or
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
might have it and I just don't think
 
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
this will work and you know this is
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
nothing against this particular issue I
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
I take that position on all the special
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
days pretty much
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you as a committee we have seen
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
these special day
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
nominations we see them every year and
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that representative
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
Lucas explained we have
 
00:11:56.459 --> 00:11:57.769 align:start position:0%
Lucas explained we have
been

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
um very hard-pressed to pass them
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
however we don't want the sponsor of the
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill or the public to think that we
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't care about these issues and that
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
they're not important
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
and walking into
 
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:11.810 align:start position:0%
and walking into
um

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
the lob today had a conversation with
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
some of the members of my committee
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
and a sponsor of one of these bills
 
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.930 align:start position:0%
and a sponsor of one of these bills
today

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a way to really
 
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
make these this event or these events
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
that people care about significant
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
and if you can help with that I'd love
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
to hear from you because I think that
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
it's something that we as a body
 
00:12:37.019 --> 00:12:37.730 align:start position:0%
it's something that we as a body
um

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
can help
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for submitting the bill
 
00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
and that wrapped up my comments okay
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have comments
 
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.389 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have comments
questions

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say that from the testimony
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
it sounded like the more effective way
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
to increase awareness would be to Lobby
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine to include more
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
training on this for their members
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
particularly for pediatricians and
 
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:11.700 align:start position:0%
primary care doctors that don't
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
specialize in reproductive systems
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
because that might be the most effective
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
place to make a change and I would hope
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be something you would
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
consider or the sponsors would consider
 
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative grotta
 
00:13:30.829 --> 00:13:30.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to offer my help if you
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
all right so any further discussion
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
the motion is in expedient to legislate
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
by lackas seconded by grotta and the
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
the committee will have to be uh
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
gracious with our clerk who is
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
on the first day
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely oh Madam chair I would also
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
say representative remind the new
 
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
members that before they answer they
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
should hit their buttons so that we can
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
hear them ah yes thank you
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
I forgot to mention that yesterday but
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes we are being recorded and live
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
streamed and if your button is not on we
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
may be able to hear you but the audience
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
certainly can't
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
we always have a a crowd at home
 
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:34.820 align:start position:0%

00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
representative blackis thank you on one

related note is that please remember to
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
turn it off because I think there's a
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
maximum of three mics that can be live
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%

uh thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
committee members didn't realize I would
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
be the only uh sponsor slash co-sponsor
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh talking to you this morning but I'm
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
happy to do that uh I am a first time
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
member of the of the house uh I am also
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
a professor of history at Keene State
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
College I'm not an American historian
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
I'm a German historian but uh this issue
 
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:56.099 align:start position:0%
and I when I was asked by representative
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
Gallagher about being a co-sponsor I
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
thought was a a great idea I am also a
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
sponsor of a bill
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
uh before another committee that would
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh have us for the state keep a
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list maintain a
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list of all the public
 
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
monuments in the state and and I was
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
just talking to representative Gerhard
 
00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
about that because I think as a
 
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
historian it's really important that we
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
talk about our history and we
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
acknowledge our history and we take
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
great pride in it uh I want to have more
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
conversations about uh the great history
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
of our state so uh I think in this case
 
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
I was looking through some previous kind
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
of commemoration days or recognition
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
days that we have here in New Hampshire
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
all of them worthy no doubt uh
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
interesting Lafayette day right so not
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
even from New Hampshire but nonetheless
 
00:48:46.859 --> 00:48:48.530 align:start position:0%
even from New Hampshire but nonetheless
worthy

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
worthy
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
um uh also K-9 Veterans Day which I
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
think is a fabulous day to have the
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth peace treaty day which is
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
really great thinking about the the
 
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
history of New Hampshire within the
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
context of United States history and his
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
history of the world the importance of
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
the the peace treaty that was concluded
 
00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:08.530 align:start position:0%
the the peace treaty that was concluded
there

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:08.540 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:49:12.609 --> 00:49:12.619 align:start position:0%
and I think that commemoration of the
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
strike at the Dover Mills in on December
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
the 30th of 1828 is also worthy of our
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
recognition uh we're all familiar I'm
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
sure with the importance of mills in in
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
the history of our State the importance
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in the united in New
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
England and in the United States is in
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
large part due to the importance of the
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
Mills uh that we had here and we are all
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
familiar I hope with a lot of the labor
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
practices that were dominant all
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
throughout New England in a lot of the
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
Mills and what we have on December 30th
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
1828 is an example of uh of a group of
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
strong New Hampshire women who uh were
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
facing an injustice they had already
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
which was the practice of the time of
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
course uh were paid considerably less
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
than the male workers within the Mills
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
but in addition to that they were being
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
required by new owners to take a uh a
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
pay cut on top of the already large
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
disparity between their pay and and the
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
pay of their male co-workers and they
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
decided that enough was enough and they
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
banded together and they made a powerful
 
00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
statement uh about that Injustice and
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
and the power of Labor to resist in the
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
face of those types of of radical
 
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
inequalities so
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
um I would argue instead of having
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
looked at the commemoration dates that
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
we have already in the history of of our
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
great state that this is certainly
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
worthy of being included on that list
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for allowing me the time
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
questions representative shurtleff
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you and
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
welcome to the New Hampshire house uh I
 
00:50:59.809 --> 00:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
just wanted if you talked to the
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources about
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
the possibility of erecting a historic
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
marker in the middle area to commemorate
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing today
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
I will leave that question to the
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Gallagher who has
 
00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:16.700 align:start position:0%
just come in I know that Dover library
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
has uh um some commemoration I'm not
 
00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
sure physically how it is commemorated
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
but I know in Dover there is some
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the event thank you okay
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
other questions representative O'Brien
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.650 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
um

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
kind of if you could put your professor
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
hat on are you sure the documentation
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
this was the first what about Lawrence's
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh bread and Roses uh they claim that
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
they were the person
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative O'Brien
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
it is from from the research I have done
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
I think there's there's some question uh
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
about whether it was the first labor
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
action I believe that the more accurate
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
wording is the first labor action which
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
was led entirely by women which is not
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
insignificant historically so from uh
 
00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
the the research that I have done I
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
believe that it is the first labor
 
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:19.140 align:start position:0%
strike LED entirely by women in the
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
United States
 
00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.250 align:start position:0%
United States
foreign

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:52:24.609 --> 00:52:24.619 align:start position:0%
thank you I had the same concern because
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
when we discussed this last session
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
there was a question of whether it was
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
the first or not and Lawrence was
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
definitely brought up other questions
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bailey more like a
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
comment I guess we've got a research
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
document here that has a little footnote
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
to the United States that says
 
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
in all women's labor strike occurred in
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
1824 at a textile mill in Pawtucket
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
and for that reason
 
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
the research doctor's saying this is the
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that clarification
 
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much other questions
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:30.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
I um yeah please introduce yourself hi
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
I'm Eric Gallagher uh representative
 
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
from uh Concord Ward 6 which is
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County
 
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.569 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County
District

00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
um 20. so and I'm
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
here to present or testify to
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 65 commemorating the first
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
labor strike in the United States by
 
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
labor strike in the United States by
women

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.069 align:start position:0%
women
um

00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:04.079 --> 00:54:05.630 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just finding
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
um what I wrote about it
 
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.870 align:start position:0%
um what I wrote about it
um

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
so yeah um
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
the history with
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so yeah my committee's Municipal and
 
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
County government which is having its
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
own hearing down the hall so
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm just stepping out from that
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
briefly to come here for this um
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
so last term I had a bill
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1144
 
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
which was to
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
require the teaching of Labor history in
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
schools so that went before
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
the education committee but they
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
generally don't like adding new
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum requirements
 
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
I still wanted to do something to
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
awareness of Labor history
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
in this step because I think
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
knowing about past labor struggles can
 
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.109 align:start position:0%
knowing about past labor struggles can
help

00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
students and workers prepare for the
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
labor struggles of
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
the present and future
 
00:55:25.559 --> 00:55:27.410 align:start position:0%
the present and future
so

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.089 align:start position:0%
so
I

00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
managed to come across this other bill
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
that representative Frost
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
had sponsored last term
 
00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.809 align:start position:0%
had sponsored last term
uh

00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:41.300 align:start position:0%
so it was House Bill
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
170 last term
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so since she is
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
has left the legislature I
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
decided to pick it up
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
from her to
 
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.049 align:start position:0%
from her to
um

00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
see if we could get past this term
 
00:55:59.819 --> 00:56:01.730 align:start position:0%
see if we could get past this term
and

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think it's just a generally
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
good way to
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
highlight an important event
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire's labor history and
 
00:56:18.049 --> 00:56:18.059 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
strong history we have here
 
00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:25.849 align:start position:0%
strong history we have here
of

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
worker workers standing up for
 
00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:29.589 align:start position:0%
worker workers standing up for
themselves

00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
so that's for
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
what people mentioned about the one in
 
00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.970 align:start position:0%
what people mentioned about the one in
Lawrence

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
Lawrence
 
00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.049 align:start position:0%
Lawrence
um

00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah if you look at the language
 
00:56:41.809 --> 00:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says
 
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:43.980 align:start position:0%
the governor shall annually issue a
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
proclamation calling for a proper
 
00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:48.059 align:start position:0%
observance of December 30th in
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
recognition of the first all-woman labor
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
strike in the state of New Hampshire so
 
00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:57.500 align:start position:0%
it's got the words all women in there
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's what makes it different from the
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
one in Lawrence because
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
the one Lawrence was led by women but
 
00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:08.180 align:start position:0%
they also had men joining in with them
 
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.130 align:start position:0%
they also had men joining in with them
so

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
this one however was all women which is
 
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:15.380 align:start position:0%
what makes it different
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
so yeah and you also have
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
gender angle to to see it from besides
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
just the labor angle um
 
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.809 align:start position:0%
just the labor angle um
so

00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:29.819 --> 00:57:30.890 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why
 
00:57:37.089 --> 00:57:37.099 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's sufficiently
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
um different from the one in Lawrence to
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
still be considered the first
 
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.589 align:start position:0%
still be considered the first
um

00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
so although I I am willing to
 
00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:55.559 align:start position:0%
um entertain an amendment to add the
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
word entirely to the title if that helps
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
clarify clarify things further
 
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
um first labor strike entirely by women
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.190 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think that
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would just be reinforcing
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
the distinction that's already made in
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
the document by saying a woman
 
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.109 align:start position:0%
the document by saying a woman
um

00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:24.119 --> 00:58:25.849 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:25.859 --> 00:58:27.470 align:start position:0%
so
that's

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
about what I have to say about the bill
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions now
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gallagher are
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know if dova
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
has any ceremonies and activities around
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
that date around in December
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
um no I don't
 
00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:52.549 align:start position:0%
um no I don't
um

00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.950 align:start position:0%
yeah I
um

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
I'm actually not too well connected
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
um with Dover myself I'm more just
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
taking this up as something that
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire and
 
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire and
um

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
is a good thing to commemorate I think
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
having recognizing it at the state level
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be good even if it is also
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
more familiar with Dover Dover is one
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
town over from me it's where I go and do
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
a lot of my shopping so this is
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
um I actually sought out Eric to add my
 
00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
name because I very much wanted to be on
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm honored to be on it I
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
want to First say and oh and by the way
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
two of my very good friends
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
independently live in the Dover Mills
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
where this happened so it is very I've
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
walked through the Mills repeatedly many
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
many times
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I want to say about
 
01:00:20.089 --> 01:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
this is while this obviously talks about
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
women and it talks about Labor I want
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
you to divorce your Notions of 2023
 
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
women's issues 2023 labor issues we're
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
not talking about 2023 and we're not
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
talking about 1923 we're talking about
 
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.849 align:start position:0%
talking about 1923 we're talking about
1828.

01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
1828.
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
100 years before women got the right to
 
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.289 align:start position:0%
100 years before women got the right to
vote

01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about Labor and women
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
issues is very very different from what
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
we are currently thinking about
 
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.569 align:start position:0%
we are currently thinking about
um

01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
and just to put that in perspective 50
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
years ago a single woman 50 years ago
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
not 250 50 years ago a woman a single
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
woman couldn't get a credit card or a
 
01:00:59.450 --> 01:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
bank account in the lifetimes of people
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
who are still very much with us and
 
01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
active today in 1972 or it wasn't until
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
1972 women were even allowed to run the
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
Boston Marathon because women's hips
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
couldn't take it so if that's what we're
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
talking about how we think of Women
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
Within peoples very much within people's
 
01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
lifetimes today it's hard it's a hard
 
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:22.140 align:start position:0%
stretch but I'm asking you to stretch
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
with me to think about 1828 because in
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
1828 women in very many ways were
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
essentially for more more or less slaves
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
and in fact that's actually one of the
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
reasons the women at this particular
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
mill strike struck or striked is because
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
um they were being quote this is their
 
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
quote abused and insulted and called
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
slaves and this was quite intentional
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
because women could be paid quite a bit
 
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.730 align:start position:0%
because women could be paid quite a bit
less

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
and very very very specifically the ads
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
that were put out at the time requested
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
girls to apply so it wasn't like today's
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
standards where people just apply and
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some kind of Social and
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
spoken discrimination no they were
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
saying we want girls specifically
 
01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
between 12 and 25 because those are the
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
the more vulnerable people who could be
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
um it coerced into accepting those
 
01:02:18.049 --> 01:02:18.059 align:start position:0%
conditions and in taking that very low
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
pay so it was a very much an intentional
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
way of exploiting young women
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
um also not only did they experience a
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
pay cut and that was one of the
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
precipitating events but also they were
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
being their pay speed was being
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
increased they were expected to produce
 
01:02:40.609 --> 01:02:40.619 align:start position:0%
more for less money and with those other
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
abuses that is why they finally striked
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
but again
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
these women it this is really almost
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
before women's issues were at the
 
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
Forefront and like something that was
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
like a household term these women
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
honestly considered themselves very much
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
in the spiritual vein of the American
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
Revolution which was not that long
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
before this was in the lifetimes of
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
their mothers right the American
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
Revolution only 50 years prior so
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
um when they striked they marched around
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
with martial Music Military music they
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
waved banners and they set off artillery
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
so they they literally set off barrels
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
of gunpowder so they very much were what
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
they felt they were doing was in the
 
01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
spirit of the American Revolution
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
fighting for the rights of regular
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
everyday people the the downtrodden so
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
the fact that this happened the fact
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
that the least Among Us the fact that
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
the least powerful people girls even by
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
today's standard is a 12 year old girl
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
really has no social power but that they
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
all by themselves without any help of
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
men uh led the first strike is
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
significant in Something New Hampshire
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
should be shouting from the rooftops
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
that this is our proud history this is
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
the kind of stock that New Hampshire has
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that is why I think it's very very
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
important that you all commemorate uh
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
this with a day
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
um and I will say that being in Dover I
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't know of any dover-specific uh and
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
I and I would think I would
 
01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:24.059 align:start position:0%
um over specific events however
 
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned the library does
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
have resources on this and the New
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
England historical society as well so uh
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
questions

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
ah representative rung thank you madam
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
chair representative Reed is it possible
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
that the governor could issue this
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
Proclamation without having it go into
 
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.030 align:start position:0%
Proclamation without having it go into
statute

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:04:53.329 --> 01:04:53.339 align:start position:0%
uh sure but
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't like trusting any other
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
branch of government to do what we can
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
do so
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to do it on our own
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
01:05:13.849 --> 01:05:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none I will close the
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:19.970 align:start position:0%
public hearing
and

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:22.260 align:start position:0%
we'll go into executive session without
 
01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.990 align:start position:0%
we'll go into executive session without
objection

01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aber you have a motion
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair I would like
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
to make a motion to expedience to
 
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay second by representative true do
 
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion sorry
 
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I will speak to my
 
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:49.430 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I will speak to my
motion

01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
I think that the comments regarding
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
strong New Hampshire women today in 2023
 
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.890 align:start position:0%
strong New Hampshire women today in 2023
is

01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
is a fantastic journey of the last 194
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
years and I think the people who
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
sponsored and co-sponsored this
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
I've worked for
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
30 years in a man-driven industry and I
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
believe truly that the more that we
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
speak out about being different we are
 
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:26.900 align:start position:0%
treated more differently so I think that
 
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
that is uh that is my perspective and
 
01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
also I think a Governor's Proclamation
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
would be fine and would not cost the
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers monies in uh building any
 
01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
 
01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else wish to comment
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair those on the
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
committee that know me into the build
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
sponsors I have a very long career in
 
01:07:04.569 --> 01:07:04.579 align:start position:0%
labor and I generally do support labor
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
but the other hat that I wear is on the
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
City Board of Alderman and I would be
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
encouraged if this town of Dover which
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
has the authority
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
in Dover itself to come out and support
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
this particular bill before we do it
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide so basically I'll leave it at
 
01:07:29.569 --> 01:07:29.579 align:start position:0%
that as my comment thank you
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone else
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you madam
 
01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:35.690 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you madam
chair

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank the speakers for
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
coming and history is very important and
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
I think we should talk about it much
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
I I just all right driving into work the
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
other day they were talking about the
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
different days and National Twinkie day
 
01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:54.299 align:start position:0%
and you know we've come up to this point
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
where there's just
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
every day for everything and I just
 
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
worry that it's it's watering down the
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
truly significant events where if we
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
actually have physical events occurring
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
in person where people can talk and ex
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
so that's my position thank you very
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
much all right anyone else
 
01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.390 align:start position:0%
much all right anyone else
representative

01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I you know want to Second
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
what representative O'Brien said
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
um not just because it was in Dover and
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
it should be limited to Dover not the
 
01:08:22.809 --> 01:08:22.819 align:start position:0%
state but having a group of people
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
organize an event and you might get some
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
news coverage is going to be a lot more
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
effective than having the governor's
 
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
staff present them with a piece of paper
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
to sign and maybe this press release and
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's the end of it which I think is
 
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
what happens with these things thank you
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
oh there she is city of Representative
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
shuitt sorry it's hard to see Crossing
 
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
um I would just say that uh also as a
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
strong supporter of Labor and um I think
 
01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:02.060 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty well recognized for that fact
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I would remind the sponsors that we
 
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
have seen this bill before on a couple
 
01:09:09.249 --> 01:09:09.259 align:start position:0%
of iterations
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if if this last two
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
sponsors were here when the first
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
comment was made that this whole issue
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
for the first in the United States has
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
been disputed
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh by a strike that occurred in Rhode
 
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.789 align:start position:0%
uh by a strike that occurred in Rhode
Island

01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
Island
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
which we've heard was all women and
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's why this iteration was denied by
 
01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:37.580 align:start position:0%
this committee last term
 
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
doubts as to whether the research was
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
really complete in both issues and
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
therefore we turned it down
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
and I was kind of sad to see that this
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
came out again saying for strike in the
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
United States
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
um I think it is a proud moment for New
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do have a member on this
 
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
committee from Dover who has stated that
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
he would like to see Dover make a big
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
deal out of this and I think that's the
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
way to approach it thank you
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
you could also I would also like to
 
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
comment that since December 30th you
 
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
might as well tie it in with the New
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
Year's Eve celebrations which in many
 
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
cities like Portsmouth and and
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
Manchester take place in the millyards
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
it'd be entirely appropriate so anyway
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's a sideline any other comments
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none the motion is
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
inexpeding to legislate by
 
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:44.580 align:start position:0%

all right anyway eczema is a atopic
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
dermatitis it's common uh type is eczema
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's results from an overactive immune
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
system that causes uh
 
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
this condition can uh occur at any part
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the body and has varied symptoms
 
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.930 align:start position:0%
of the body and has varied symptoms
um

01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:52.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
the thing that I really wanted to hit on
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
was that it affects uh 9.6 million
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
children in the United States and about
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
16.5 million uh adults in the United
 
01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:09.709 align:start position:0%
16.5 million uh adults in the United
States

01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:14.820 align:start position:0%
um it's an inflammatory condition and
 
01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.490 align:start position:0%
um it's an inflammatory condition and
uh

01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
other than getting into the medical
 
01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:21.060 align:start position:0%
start of it uh
 
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's essentially what I uh it was
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
asked by a constituent to to submit this
 
01:34:31.850 --> 01:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
and and she's here to give further
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
testimony but if you have any questions
 
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
for me I'd be happy to try to
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
answer it thank you representative are
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you maybe you can answer this
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
or maybe the person asked for it can and
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
um I understand you want to raise
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
awareness but what action do you want to
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
have happen as part of that I mean is it
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
you know awareness among
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
people that might have it not know what
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
they have among the medical community or
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
what I I think she could probably answer
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
not seeing them thank you very much
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%

Londonderry this is my son Matthew my
 
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
daughter Paige and my husband Lou
 
01:35:42.649 --> 01:35:42.659 align:start position:0%
we come here today to speak in favor of
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
House Bill 94 to help raise awareness
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
about Eczema
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
Matthew has suffered with eczema his
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
whole life
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
eczema is a skin condition that causes
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
dry itchy inflamed skin
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
most people think of eczema as a small
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
dry patch of skin
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
but for most patients including Matthew
 
01:36:04.729 --> 01:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
it impacts the quality of life by
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
causing lack of sleep mental health
 
01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
causing lack of sleep mental health
issues

01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
and out-of-pocket Healthcare class
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
the impacts of living with eczema go
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
beyond health concerns
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
children with eczema are reported to
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
have an increased number of missed
 
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
school days
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
and they have experienced bullying due
 
01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
parents of children with eczema average
 
01:36:36.169 --> 01:36:36.179 align:start position:0%
fewer than five hours of sleep per night
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
impacting their work day
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
one school year Matthew had 81 visits to
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
the nurse which resulted in Miss
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
classroom time
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
he's been hospitalized three times
 
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
so we ask you to help us raise awareness
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
about the burden of this disease
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
to help increase funding on the state
 
01:37:01.370 --> 01:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
and federal level level for research
 
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
and to increase or to improve the
 
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
quality of life for these patients
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%

ever since elementary school I've gone
 
01:37:42.530 --> 01:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
through bullying at school due to rashy
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
skin and at home scratching cause welts
 
01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
and rashes which affects me which
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%

anyone else representative rung thank
 
01:40:05.770 --> 01:40:05.780 align:start position:0%
you madam chair Matthew I just want to
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
repeat what my colleagues have said
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for coming in for
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
sharing your story and for your family
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
I've learned more about Eczema through
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
your testimony than I knew before so
 
01:40:19.729 --> 01:40:19.739 align:start position:0%
um you've reached one person for sure
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of us so thank you thank
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Broda
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
I do want to ask the question that
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas so eloquently asked
 
01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:33.410 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas so eloquently asked
because

01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
just says we're aware you know raise
 
01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.470 align:start position:0%
just says we're aware you know raise
awareness

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
and so it would appear like that in
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
Statue and that's where it would stay
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
so what is it exactly that you're
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
when you say raise awareness because we
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping by raising awareness but
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
this will increase funding for the for
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
research of this disease and various
 
01:41:08.159 --> 01:41:13.370 align:start position:0%
research of this disease and various
treatments

01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'm not really
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure about this are there treatments
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
available that are effective I remember
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
I had when I was younger I remember
 
01:41:23.090 --> 01:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
there was like a packet you put in the
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
bathtub and you soak in it and then that
 
01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
was that but obviously I passed through
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
that phase I guess so I'm just curious
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
about what type of treatments yes is it
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
there's something readily available or
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
is this some kind of a super expensive
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of new medications in the

um when Matt was an infant he would have
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
to take bleach baths he'd have to take
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
tar bass topical steroids
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
um a treatment called wet wraps now
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more medications on the
 
01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:54.890 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more medications on the
market

01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:41:59.810 --> 01:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.729 --> 01:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh it it seems to
 
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
me that there's a currently uh an ad
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
campaign going on television uh for a
 
01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
particular product I I I I don't have
 
01:42:21.290 --> 01:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
any experience in my family so uh it's
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
not something that I'm fixated on or
 
01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
that we ought to try that uh so I can't
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
tell you what the name of the product is
 
01:42:30.890 --> 01:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
in other words it must be a bad ad uh
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
but it you're all nodding and
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
recognition maybe depiction
 
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
I I didn't get the name because but I've
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
seen the ad over and over and over again
 
01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
so and this is the disease you're
 
01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
talking about right
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
it shows it shows the people with the
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
red patches on the elbows yes yes and so
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
forth yes that is eczema correct
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:43:07.250 --> 01:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Fitzpatrick
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
good question uh the question it is the
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
biggest is the ad that we're seeing on
 
01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:14.209 align:start position:0%
biggest is the ad that we're seeing on
TV

01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:14.219 align:start position:0%
TV
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you're seeing more and more companies
 
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
now on the outside invest in this Tech
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
in uh remedies for eczema only because
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
it's becoming more prevalent in our
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
society as Mr Lundgren spoke about 25
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
million people in this world in this
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
country are affected by eczema to a
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
certain degree so it's not just Matthew
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
and Matthew's come a long way so he's 17
 
01:43:36.050 --> 01:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
now he's come a long way in this we're
 
01:43:37.729 --> 01:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
not looking for sympathy for Matthew but
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're representing other people
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
who have been afflicted by by eczema so
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I I hope we addressed your questions
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
with bringing bringing awareness to the
 
01:43:50.689 --> 01:43:50.699 align:start position:0%
to to eczema for other people
 
01:43:52.910 --> 01:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and yes uh you were seeing more and
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
more ads coming online for uh for
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
depiction and other related uh Therapies
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
could I just follow up man follow up so
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh this product is being advertised uh
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
it do you have any personal experience
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
with it whether whether that's something
 
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
that you see the ads and you don't know
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether it really works or not like Flex
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
Seal for your drains and so forth you're
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
going like does it really work or not so
 
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
the pixin is actually an injectable
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
um there's there are topicals and
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're injectables and they each have a
 
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
different degree of efficacy some work
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
better than others I would say that the
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
depiction the one that you're seeing on
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
TV is probably more uh more invasive on
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
the body whereas a topical you can
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
control the amount of steroid that you
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
apply to your skin and they have
 
01:44:40.129 --> 01:44:40.139 align:start position:0%
different degrees from a scale of one to
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
seven as it's explained so if you have a
 
01:44:45.169 --> 01:44:45.179 align:start position:0%
more severe case of atopic dermatitis
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
you may put on a emollient or a or a
 
01:44:48.179 --> 01:44:49.250 align:start position:0%
you may put on a emollient or a or a
topical

01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
topical
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
um that's stronger if you have less
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
eczema to your skin maybe you go with
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
something less less invasive on the skin
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
on the body
 
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:00.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I want to
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you folks for coming here
 
01:45:09.119 --> 01:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
thank you folks for coming here
um it's

01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
not often at all we have a whole family
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
testified before us so it's great to see
 
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:18.590 align:start position:0%
testified before us so it's great to see
um

01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
I was just looking briefly online
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
because I always like when these bills
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
come before us to see if there's
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
National recognition for a lot of these
 
01:45:31.570 --> 01:45:31.580 align:start position:0%
issues and are you aware that October is
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
eczema awareness month I'm looking at
 
01:45:34.619 --> 01:45:37.070 align:start position:0%
eczema awareness month I'm looking at
the

01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:38.689 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:45:38.689 --> 01:45:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
website of the national eczema
 
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:44.209 align:start position:0%
website of the national eczema
Association

01:45:44.209 --> 01:45:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
so we do a lot of work with the national
 
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
eczema Association so they've declared
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
October awareness month for their
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
organization but we're trying to
 
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
bring awareness at the state level as
 
01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:56.689 align:start position:0%
bring awareness at the state level as
well

01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I like I second the uh you know
 
01:46:09.850 --> 01:46:09.860 align:start position:0%
thanking you for coming and uh
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
you know if this passes what will happen
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
is the governor will be presented
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
something to sign there may be a press
 
01:46:21.470 --> 01:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
release and that's probably about it
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
my concern is it won't really do
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything effectively to raise awareness
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
probably Those ads raised tremendously
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
more awareness
 
01:46:30.890 --> 01:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
than something like this and I'm just
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's something
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
else that could be done that might
 
01:46:36.649 --> 01:46:36.659 align:start position:0%
actually be effective but my concern is
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
I've joined a legislative panel with the
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
national eczema Association
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and we're working on efforts to to
 
01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
raise awareness so
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
um there'll be things coming down the
 
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
pike if this is past
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
um to increase awareness
 
01:46:55.739 --> 01:46:57.350 align:start position:0%
um to increase awareness
follow-up

01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:59.330 align:start position:0%
follow-up
so

01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
could those things occur with or without
 
01:47:04.010 --> 01:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
I mean how you know they haven't they
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
have not done so already
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
any else anyone else represent Broda
 
01:47:20.109 --> 01:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that you wanted to
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
result one of the things that you've
 
01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:23.629 align:start position:0%
result one of the things that you've
said

01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
is that you want funding for research
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
and this I don't know how this bill does
 
01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:31.970 align:start position:0%
and this I don't know how this bill does
that

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
well to raise awareness about the burden
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
of this disease so that people don't
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
think that eczema is just a dry patch of
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
skin that there is a lot more to it
 
01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
there's an emotional component there's
 
01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:44.570 align:start position:0%
there's an emotional component there's
um

01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
a lifestyle impact
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a burden of this of this
 
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.169 align:start position:0%

Bill 94. is there a second
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you do we
 
01:48:52.129 --> 01:48:52.139 align:start position:0%
should speak to your motion
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
yes I do and I first want to thank the
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
family for coming here
 
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.790 align:start position:0%
family for coming here
um

01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
we see numerous
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
bills before this committee the first
 
01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
two we heard today were naming days and
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
months and we take that um not a
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
light-hearted um there are quite a few
 
01:49:15.970 --> 01:49:15.980 align:start position:0%
naming days weeks and months in statute
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
that I think uh a lot of people out
 
01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
there are not aware of it's nice to put
 
01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
it into statute or Proclaim it but I I
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
think the more effective way because
 
01:49:35.229 --> 01:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
this is just proclaiming October
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
2023 as eczema awareness month is and I
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
would strongly suggest to this family to
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
reach out to the governor's office with
 
01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:45.070 align:start position:0%
reach out to the governor's office with
their

01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
plea to
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
recognize this if it's going to be for
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
one month the governor does this quite
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
often when approached versus having to
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature in the
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
legislature having to go through this
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
process it's done on an often thing so I
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
I would strongly recommend taking that
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
route and seeing the government have it
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
done I think you'll get more press doing
 
01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
it that way with you folks around him
 
01:50:13.619 --> 01:50:15.649 align:start position:0%
it that way with you folks around him
and

01:50:15.649 --> 01:50:15.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:15.659 --> 01:50:18.890 align:start position:0%

03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
Lung Care awareness month and expressing
 
03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
support for the early detection and
 
03:04:34.190 --> 03:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
treatment of lung cancer
 
03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
as you may know or may not know that
 
03:04:40.130 --> 03:04:40.140 align:start position:0%
lung cancer is a deadly disease
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
and it has the highest mortality rate
 
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
for cancer among other cancer rates in
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
the US and in worldwide measurements
 
03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
but the good news is that this terrible
 
03:04:52.849 --> 03:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
disease is treatable
 
03:04:54.889 --> 03:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
and especially if it's caught in the
 
03:04:57.050 --> 03:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
early stages
 
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and increasingly becomes survivable
 
03:05:04.190 --> 03:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
if you're like me you didn't know that
 
03:05:07.190 --> 03:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's very possible to to get
 
03:05:08.990 --> 03:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with lung cancer without
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
having ever smoked
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I understand that
 
03:05:15.050 --> 03:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
um common worldwide rates is one in
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
every four cancer lung cancer diagnosis
 
03:05:19.429 --> 03:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
is for a person who's never
 
03:05:22.610 --> 03:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:23.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:05:23.450 --> 03:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
so while this may be the most deadly
 
03:05:27.309 --> 03:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
form of cancer
 
03:05:29.950 --> 03:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and mortality rate
 
03:05:33.230 --> 03:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the United States it is one of those
 
03:05:36.769 --> 03:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
lowest amounts of screening rates so
 
03:05:38.570 --> 03:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
lung cancer currently
 
03:05:41.809 --> 03:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
has about a six percent screen rate
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
but other forms of cancer screenings
 
03:05:47.570 --> 03:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
such as breast cancer colon cancer they
 
03:05:49.849 --> 03:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
have higher rates of 60 to 80 percent of
 
03:05:52.250 --> 03:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
screening rates so even though it's more
 
03:05:55.570 --> 03:05:55.580 align:start position:0%
deadly it's much much significantly less
 
03:05:57.769 --> 03:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
screened for
 
03:06:00.530 --> 03:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
so it's a critical issue but you don't
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
have to take my my word for it
 
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
um so in your online testimony for the
 
03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
committee's official record you'll see
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
there's strong support from the
 
03:06:12.769 --> 03:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
comprehensive lung cancer physicians in
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
our state which I believe there are five
 
03:06:17.090 --> 03:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
existing Thoracic Surgeons in the state
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
and four of them have submitted
 
03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
testimony on this issue
 
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
and those Thoracic Surgeons reside at
 
03:06:25.790 --> 03:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Healthcare and the Health Care
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
system up in Lebanon New Hampshire
 
03:06:29.929 --> 03:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
there's also strong support for this
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
resolution coming from Thoracic Surgeons
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
across the country the American lung
 
03:06:35.590 --> 03:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
cancer screening initiative
 
03:06:38.269 --> 03:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
Representatives have also also submitted
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
testimony supporting this resolution
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
furthermore you'll see that there is
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
strong support from the healthcare
 
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector here in our state in
 
03:06:50.450 --> 03:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
fact one of the non-profits known as
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
Thorn or thoracic
 
03:06:56.110 --> 03:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
surgery outcomes research Network Inc
 
03:06:59.090 --> 03:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
was unable to submit testimony online in
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
time for today's
 
03:07:03.469 --> 03:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
um hearing but doesn't in fact know of
 
03:07:07.370 --> 03:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:08.809 --> 03:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
um the reasoning that this screening is
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
so important is that
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
um you know you can just look to the
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
most recent medical literature in fact
 
03:07:19.429 --> 03:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
in the January 2023 Journal of thoracic
 
03:07:23.450 --> 03:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
surgery there's a new study out entitled
 
03:07:25.309 --> 03:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
stage shift improves lung cancer
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
survival the real real world evidence
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
this primary author whose name is Dr
 
03:07:31.439 --> 03:07:32.809 align:start position:0%
this primary author whose name is Dr
yang

03:07:32.809 --> 03:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
yang
 
03:07:35.570 --> 03:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
provides the main finding that although
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
lung cancer incidence keeps increasing
 
03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the world that the mortality
 
03:07:42.170 --> 03:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
rate is actually decreasing gradually
 
03:07:44.809 --> 03:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
for all stages of cancer and especially
 
03:07:47.050 --> 03:07:47.060 align:start position:0%
when early detection
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
is able to identify more localized lung
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
cancer as opposed to a larger advanced
 
03:07:54.240 --> 03:07:55.849 align:start position:0%
cancer as opposed to a larger advanced
disease

03:07:55.849 --> 03:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
disease
 
03:07:55.859 --> 03:07:58.730 align:start position:0%
disease
so

03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.590 --> 03:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
what can we do as a Statewide Community
 
03:08:03.230 --> 03:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
to you know recognize the issue of lung
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
cancers to increase this awareness is my
 
03:08:08.090 --> 03:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
answer and to say
 
03:08:10.730 --> 03:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
you know it's our responsibility as
 
03:08:12.590 --> 03:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
leaders in the state to promote the
 
03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
advanced screening and greater
 
03:08:16.250 --> 03:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
eligibility for folks
 
03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
um to get the test to find out whether
 
03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
or not you know they have early stage
 
03:08:20.939 --> 03:08:23.389 align:start position:0%
or not you know they have early stage
cancer

03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.010 --> 03:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
um the good news is that eligibility for
 
03:08:26.690 --> 03:08:26.700 align:start position:0%
screening for lung cancer has recently
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
expanded and more Granite Staters can be
 
03:08:30.650 --> 03:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
screened and avoid you know becoming
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
other Cancer Victim
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
instead you know by receiving this early
 
03:08:37.370 --> 03:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
detection they can be part of the new
 
03:08:40.190 --> 03:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
numbers of survivors even you know the
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
highest lung cancer
 
03:08:43.730 --> 03:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
is found
 
03:08:46.250 --> 03:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
procedurally I just like the committee
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
to know that the legislation was
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
submitted in the form of a resolution
 
03:08:52.849 --> 03:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
based on the previous
 
03:08:52.859 --> 03:08:54.110 align:start position:0%
based on the previous
um

03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
attempts by similar entities proposing
 
03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
legislation across the United States so
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there are a
 
03:09:05.090 --> 03:09:05.100 align:start position:0%
handful dozens in fact other states who
 
03:09:08.990 --> 03:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
have passed similar resolutions already
 
03:09:11.450 --> 03:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
but of course we are open I am open as
 
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor to amending this
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
legislation to make it a proper House
 
03:09:17.570 --> 03:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
Bill if that's what the committee
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
determines is more effective
 
03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
finally I'd just like to say that this
 
03:09:24.170 --> 03:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
is a personal matter for me
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm in fact a married medicine to one of
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
the Thoracic Surgeons who did sign some
 
03:09:31.010 --> 03:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
of the testimony that was submitted to
 
03:09:31.020 --> 03:09:32.450 align:start position:0%
of the testimony that was submitted to
you

03:09:32.450 --> 03:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:09:33.710 --> 03:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
03:09:35.389 --> 03:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
um it's even more personal lung cancer
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
has claimed multiple members of my
 
03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
has claimed multiple members of my
family

03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
family
 
03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
as well as my neighbors so
 
03:09:43.370 --> 03:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
whatever amount of good that this
 
03:09:45.170 --> 03:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
legislation could potentially do for the
 
03:09:48.110 --> 03:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
state and granite Staters
 
03:09:51.050 --> 03:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
broadly is you know a wonderful gift to
 
03:09:53.150 --> 03:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
our state and I think if if this
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
recognition can even save one life it
 
03:09:58.010 --> 03:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
will be a day of good work here in the
 
03:09:59.210 --> 03:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire house
 
03:10:01.550 --> 03:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
so with that I urge the committee to
 
03:10:03.769 --> 03:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
support unanimously the passage of this
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
house resolution and I'm happy to take
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:10:09.230 --> 03:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
03:10:11.929 --> 03:10:11.939 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:10:11.939 --> 03:10:14.330 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:10:16.130 --> 03:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:10:18.410 --> 03:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
um most resolutions that urge
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
recognition of this type of want
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
somebody to notify somebody
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
normally it's to have the governor make
 
03:10:34.969 --> 03:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
a proclamation or to notify members of
 
03:10:37.370 --> 03:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
our Congressional Delegation things of
 
03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
that sort I don't see anything like that
 
03:10:42.969 --> 03:10:42.979 align:start position:0%
in this resolution
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
has the governor already done this kind
 
03:10:49.070 --> 03:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
of thing does he do this on an annual
 
03:10:50.750 --> 03:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
basis do you know
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:10:52.319 --> 03:10:53.389 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

03:10:53.389 --> 03:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:10:55.309 --> 03:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
um as I previously mentioned in my
 
03:10:55.319 --> 03:10:56.929 align:start position:0%
um as I previously mentioned in my
introduction

03:10:56.929 --> 03:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the format of this legislation is
 
03:11:01.370 --> 03:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
pretty much a carbon copy of the
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
previous submissions across the United
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
States to other states who have adopted
 
03:11:06.410 --> 03:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
the resolution so
 
03:11:08.269 --> 03:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
um it does not include a notification
 
03:11:10.910 --> 03:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
type mechanism as you've indicated might
 
03:11:13.730 --> 03:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
be helpful and I'm definitely open to
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
you know providing an amendment that
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
might do the kind of thing that you're
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
asking for I think
 
03:11:19.500 --> 03:11:20.570 align:start position:0%
asking for I think
um

03:11:20.570 --> 03:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:23.210 --> 03:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
or what you're looking for I should say
 
03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
um I think you know I'm here to take the
 
03:11:26.990 --> 03:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
advice of the committee to find out you
 
03:11:28.250 --> 03:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
know the best possible way to move
 
03:11:30.769 --> 03:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
forward to affect the most you know
 
03:11:34.910 --> 03:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
possible changes possible so thank you
 
03:11:38.050 --> 03:11:38.060 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
has your group that you represent
 
03:11:43.969 --> 03:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
notified the governor of this or
 
03:11:46.190 --> 03:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
attempted to have the governor do
 
03:11:48.410 --> 03:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
recognition previously
 
03:11:50.210 --> 03:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the American
 
03:11:51.769 --> 03:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
Lung Cancer
 
03:11:53.570 --> 03:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me the American lung cancer
 
03:11:56.090 --> 03:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
screening initiative has previously had
 
03:11:58.610 --> 03:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
contact with the governor of our state
 
03:11:58.620 --> 03:12:00.050 align:start position:0%
contact with the governor of our state
but

03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
he or the main representative of that
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
group has directly contacted me to also
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
see if there's some momentum because
 
03:12:09.889 --> 03:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't sound like they got as far
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
as they had hoped through the executive
 
03:12:11.880 --> 03:12:14.570 align:start position:0%
as they had hoped through the executive
office

03:12:14.570 --> 03:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhart thank
 
03:12:18.769 --> 03:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
03:12:20.510 --> 03:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the screening has been
 
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:23.580 align:start position:0%
improved the access to it is is lung
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
cancer screening prohibitively expensive
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the problem getting
 
03:12:30.530 --> 03:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
people screened exactly just curious I
 
03:12:31.610 --> 03:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
know sure
 
03:12:33.950 --> 03:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
um probably that question is best
 
03:12:35.809 --> 03:12:35.819 align:start position:0%
directed to the Physicians who have
 
03:12:37.550 --> 03:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
submitted the online testimony and I
 
03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
hope that they address it in their
 
03:12:40.969 --> 03:12:40.979 align:start position:0%
letters to you I'm thinking back and I'm
 
03:12:42.889 --> 03:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
not sure it does but from my
 
03:12:42.899 --> 03:12:43.969 align:start position:0%
not sure it does but from my
understanding

03:12:43.969 --> 03:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:12:46.610 --> 03:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
um is that recently the eligibility
 
03:12:49.550 --> 03:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
criteria nationally has expanded so that
 
03:12:51.889 --> 03:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
more Americans are eligible for this
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursable screening process through
 
03:12:56.809 --> 03:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
their insurance
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
um so the idea is that um even in the
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
last I think
 
03:13:04.130 --> 03:13:04.140 align:start position:0%
as recent as the last few years the
 
03:13:06.530 --> 03:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
amount the rates of of the amount of
 
03:13:07.849 --> 03:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
Americans who are actually taking
 
03:13:09.590 --> 03:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of that screening program has
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
more than doubled so
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I think the reality is that many
 
03:13:16.010 --> 03:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
people who are eligible don't realize
 
03:13:19.130 --> 03:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
that this is something that they are
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know that they can Embrace and take
 
03:13:24.410 --> 03:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
advantage of the program so that's kind
 
03:13:26.150 --> 03:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
of what we're here today to decide is
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
what can we do as state legislators to
 
03:13:30.290 --> 03:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
increase that awareness and I'm hopeful
 
03:13:32.690 --> 03:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
that this piece of legislation will help
 
03:13:34.790 --> 03:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
trigger that knowledge if you look into
 
03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:35.630 align:start position:0%
trigger that knowledge if you look into
the

03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:13:38.330 --> 03:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
actual context of the resolution itself
 
03:13:41.150 --> 03:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
it talks about you know the deadliness
 
03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:42.469 align:start position:0%
it talks about you know the deadliness
and

03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:44.990 --> 03:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the ability to screen
 
03:13:46.969 --> 03:13:46.979 align:start position:0%
and you know trying to drive those
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
numbers up and in statistically speaking
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
I think the more people who get screened
 
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
the more lives can be saved so even that
 
03:13:56.570 --> 03:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
small two percent increase over a
 
03:13:56.580 --> 03:13:57.650 align:start position:0%
small two percent increase over a
five-year

03:13:57.650 --> 03:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
five-year
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know for cancer screens is Gonna
 
03:14:02.809 --> 03:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
Save countless lives so
 
03:14:05.090 --> 03:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry I can't speak particularly
 
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
and great detail to your question but I
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
think generally that's the idea that
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for reimbursement used to be
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
much more controlled and it's become
 
03:14:18.110 --> 03:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
expanded recently
 
03:14:20.929 --> 03:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative thank you this is maybe a
 
03:14:22.490 --> 03:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
question for you or somebody
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
um there have been some references to
 
03:14:26.030 --> 03:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
written testimony and maybe email sent
 
03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at my rep email I'm not
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
seeing anything it was not sent by email
 
03:14:33.650 --> 03:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
it was submitted via the the house
 
03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
testimony process which
 
03:14:39.050 --> 03:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid we don't get very often in
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
this committee but we'll have to figure
 
03:14:42.410 --> 03:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
out where it is and how to get it to
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
people I also can forward
 
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
um both of the copies that I have
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
received via PDF to the company if
 
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's something that's helpful thank
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
you I think that will be helpful to
 
03:15:00.410 --> 03:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:03.769 --> 03:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you man I'm sure
 
03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
so representative you referenced uh some
 
03:15:13.610 --> 03:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
possibility of amendment uh and have you
 
03:15:16.550 --> 03:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
been thinking about what the content of
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
that Amendment might be because
 
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
the committee is
 
03:15:25.990 --> 03:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
heard a number of bills this morning and
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing members incumbent members have
 
03:15:32.389 --> 03:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
heard a number of this type of bills
 
03:15:35.050 --> 03:15:35.060 align:start position:0%
over the years that we've served
 
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
and and frankly we find that it's it
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't really accomplish very much kind
 
03:15:45.130 --> 03:15:45.140 align:start position:0%
of words on written on the Wind
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
what do you have in mind with regard to
 
03:15:52.010 --> 03:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh possibility of having some greater
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
toothiness if you will uh and with
 
03:15:58.429 --> 03:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
regard to your resolved clause
 
03:16:00.530 --> 03:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
well representative thank you for the
 
03:16:00.540 --> 03:16:01.370 align:start position:0%
well representative thank you for the
question

03:16:01.370 --> 03:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:16:04.490 --> 03:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
um in particularly I'm thankful because
 
03:16:04.500 --> 03:16:05.030 align:start position:0%
um in particularly I'm thankful because
um

03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:06.889 --> 03:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
you know this is my first crack at the
 
03:16:10.969 --> 03:16:10.979 align:start position:0%
Apple of trying to find a resolution to
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
pass this body
 
03:16:14.030 --> 03:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
um to help raise awareness across the
 
03:16:16.849 --> 03:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
state for a specific month of the of a
 
03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
specific year for a specific issue
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
I am hopeful that because the cancer
 
03:16:25.130 --> 03:16:25.140 align:start position:0%
rate for this disease is amongst the
 
03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:26.150 align:start position:0%
rate for this disease is amongst the
highest

03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
highest
 
03:16:28.070 --> 03:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and is has the highest mortality rate
 
03:16:29.929 --> 03:16:29.939 align:start position:0%
in the country for any other cancerous
 
03:16:31.849 --> 03:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
disease that this committee will take
 
03:16:35.090 --> 03:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
special recognition of that you know
 
03:16:38.990 --> 03:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
status and consider this to be one of
 
03:16:41.530 --> 03:16:41.540 align:start position:0%
the worthy projects before put before
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
this body and to answer your questions
 
03:16:44.640 --> 03:16:46.250 align:start position:0%
this body and to answer your questions
specifically

03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
I am open and um
 
03:16:52.130 --> 03:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
will commit to you to work very hard to
 
03:16:55.730 --> 03:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
try to find a way to not only make this
 
03:16:58.070 --> 03:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
resolution on paper something that we
 
03:17:00.650 --> 03:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
can promote as a body but also to find
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
some action in the private sector to
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
support this resolution there are
 
03:17:08.570 --> 03:17:08.580 align:start position:0%
clearly enough Physicians and you know
 
03:17:10.670 --> 03:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
nationally based as long as state as
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
well as state-based Physicians who
 
03:17:14.690 --> 03:17:14.700 align:start position:0%
directly deal with this disease that are
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
already behind this effort
 
03:17:19.010 --> 03:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
um so you know they're going to continue
 
03:17:21.769 --> 03:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
to do the things that they do in their
 
03:17:24.769 --> 03:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
private sector jobs to promote that
 
03:17:27.290 --> 03:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
awareness but we will be the missing key
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
of the public sector to support them in
 
03:17:32.929 --> 03:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
their Endeavors and this is one way to
 
03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to get that motion moving in the same
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
direction so
 
03:17:39.230 --> 03:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
um I like I'm trying to express to you
 
03:17:41.630 --> 03:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps not very well that I'm willing
 
03:17:43.190 --> 03:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
to take whatever recommendation the
 
03:17:44.750 --> 03:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
to try to make that eventuality come to
 
03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:50.570 align:start position:0%
to try to make that eventuality come to
fruition

03:17:50.570 --> 03:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:52.319 --> 03:17:52.969 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:17:52.969 --> 03:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
so as you are certainly aware uh vaping
 
03:18:01.090 --> 03:18:01.100 align:start position:0%
was a topic du jour for quite a while
 
03:18:05.090 --> 03:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
more than just a couple of days and
 
03:18:06.830 --> 03:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
there was some drop off there was some
 
03:18:08.690 --> 03:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
action taken I Believe by the federal
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
government with regard to vaping and yet
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
you still see you know I still see
 
03:18:16.010 --> 03:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
people driving by with big clouds of
 
03:18:18.410 --> 03:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
smoke coming out of their vehicle maybe
 
03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
not during these days but anyway
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
so people are still getting into vaping
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
children are still taking up vaping if
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
they can get a hold of stuff so we we
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
we're not a medical committee
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have any expertise in that area
 
03:18:37.790 --> 03:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
03:18:39.950 --> 03:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
the ideas are going to have to come from
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:47.090 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
important

03:18:47.090 --> 03:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:18:47.100 --> 03:18:47.809 align:start position:0%
important
um

03:18:47.809 --> 03:18:47.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:49.849 --> 03:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
you know reflection of you know the
 
03:18:51.650 --> 03:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
responsibility we bear
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know just in considering this
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
legislation and myself as the prime
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor I I'm keenly aware
 
03:19:02.210 --> 03:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
um of the private sector's work
 
03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and to mention vaping is a part a
 
03:19:08.570 --> 03:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
small part of the you know larger scheme
 
03:19:11.090 --> 03:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
of lung cancer disease uh you know
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
awareness that we're trying to
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
to promulgate through this legislation
 
03:19:15.840 --> 03:19:17.030 align:start position:0%
to promulgate through this legislation
so

03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:19.730 --> 03:19:19.740 align:start position:0%
um you know I think there is larger
 
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
genetic concerns larger familial
 
03:19:26.210 --> 03:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
concerns as well as you know smoking
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
vaping that also contribute to this
 
03:19:30.170 --> 03:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
disease so
 
03:19:30.180 --> 03:19:31.429 align:start position:0%
disease so
um

03:19:31.429 --> 03:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know I understand it's an uphill
 
03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:34.490 align:start position:0%
you know I understand it's an uphill
battle

03:19:34.490 --> 03:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
battle
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
um to try to get folks to understand
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
that they're eligible to be aware of the
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
disease screening and that you know if
 
03:19:44.090 --> 03:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
you are diagnosed with the disease that
 
03:19:46.730 --> 03:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
you can treat it if you act quickly and
 
03:19:47.870 --> 03:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know consult with medical
 
03:19:47.880 --> 03:19:49.550 align:start position:0%
you know consult with medical
professionals

03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know I think every step in the right
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
direction of trying to increase that
 
03:19:55.910 --> 03:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
awareness and to you know help people
 
03:19:58.370 --> 03:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
make the decision to be screened and to
 
03:20:01.370 --> 03:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
be treated is going to be a huge huge
 
03:20:03.710 --> 03:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
Plus for you know our mortality rates as
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
a society
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
so I I wasn't trying to point you in the
 
03:20:10.190 --> 03:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
direction of vaping but just giving it
 
03:20:13.630 --> 03:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
an example of something that was a big
 
03:20:16.690 --> 03:20:16.700 align:start position:0%
subject of conversation and controversy
 
03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago uh and uh there
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
was some action was taken but your your
 
03:20:25.570 --> 03:20:25.580 align:start position:0%
whereas Clauses
 
03:20:28.010 --> 03:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
reflect the fact that there are many
 
03:20:30.410 --> 03:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
people who get into lung cancer they
 
03:20:32.929 --> 03:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
never smoked their family never smoked
 
03:20:36.530 --> 03:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
maybe so uh but again we're not a
 
03:20:39.050 --> 03:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
medical committee so the impulses I
 
03:20:42.590 --> 03:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:44.170 --> 03:20:44.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:48.830 --> 03:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.650 --> 03:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips um
 
03:20:54.349 --> 03:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
the issue that I have
 
03:20:57.410 --> 03:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
you say in your
 
03:21:03.650 --> 03:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:04.849 --> 03:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire and
 
03:21:06.349 --> 03:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
encourages the people of New Hampshire
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
to observe National Lung awareness month
 
03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
with appropriate awareness and
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
educational activities
 
03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how that's gonna happen
 
03:21:16.730 --> 03:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
because of this bill
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
or this resolution
 
03:21:21.349 --> 03:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
and I guess that the the issue that we
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
have as a committee with these type of
 
03:21:24.710 --> 03:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
things is that
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
although the intent is sincere and
 
03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:30.110 align:start position:0%
although the intent is sincere and
passionate

03:21:30.110 --> 03:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
passionate
 
03:21:33.469 --> 03:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
there isn't a vehicle to in New
 
03:21:33.479 --> 03:21:34.429 align:start position:0%
there isn't a vehicle to in New
Hampshire

03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:21:34.439 --> 03:21:36.349 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
to

03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
carry out this mission
 
03:21:41.570 --> 03:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
it has to be done through
 
03:21:46.190 --> 03:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
either a Board of Medicine or and
 
03:21:48.590 --> 03:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization we simply don't
 
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
have the infrastructure to do that and
 
03:21:51.540 --> 03:21:53.090 align:start position:0%
have the infrastructure to do that and
so

03:21:53.090 --> 03:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
we tend not to
 
03:21:58.730 --> 03:21:58.740 align:start position:0%
support this type because we think that
 
03:22:01.849 --> 03:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
it's misleading just put this in a piece
 
03:22:03.769 --> 03:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
of paper that's going to end up in a
 
03:22:06.170 --> 03:22:06.180 align:start position:0%
book on the Shelf I never looked at
 
03:22:08.210 --> 03:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
again does that make sense it does
 
03:22:10.070 --> 03:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for that
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
comment and I guess my response to that
 
03:22:16.610 --> 03:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
is that rest assured that the private
 
03:22:17.870 --> 03:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
sector here in the state of New
 
03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and across New England and
 
03:22:22.070 --> 03:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
across the country impact the world are
 
03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
already putting those private actions
 
03:22:26.210 --> 03:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
into motion
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
so by asking you know by designing this
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation as a resolution my
 
03:22:32.990 --> 03:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that a resolution
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
reflects the opinion of the body a
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
unanimous opinion of the body
 
03:22:40.849 --> 03:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
so um I hope that
 
03:22:42.830 --> 03:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
um that opinion is that we would like to
 
03:22:44.510 --> 03:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
promote the screening and the awareness
 
03:22:46.849 --> 03:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
of lung cancer screening and that this
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
disease is preventable is treatable
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
if caught
 
03:22:51.960 --> 03:22:52.670 align:start position:0%
if caught
um

03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
so if it's the opinion of the body
 
03:22:56.090 --> 03:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
through a house resolution that they
 
03:22:58.250 --> 03:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
support this private sector work that's
 
03:22:59.870 --> 03:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
being done here in the state for
 
03:23:01.929 --> 03:23:01.939 align:start position:0%
instance by the Dartmouth Healthcare
 
03:23:04.849 --> 03:23:04.859 align:start position:0%
Thoracic Surgeons or you know the
 
03:23:06.170 --> 03:23:06.180 align:start position:0%
American lung cancer screening
 
03:23:08.090 --> 03:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
initiative that's ongoing through the
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
Norris cotton
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
um or through the Norris cotton Cancer
 
03:23:17.229 --> 03:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
Center that's also located at Dartmouth
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that are you know these events are
 
03:23:21.469 --> 03:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
happening these motions are already
 
03:23:23.229 --> 03:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
taking place with the resolution
 
03:23:26.090 --> 03:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
reflects is that it's the body's opinion
 
03:23:29.090 --> 03:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
that we support them and it's by by
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
doing so I hope to increase that
 
03:23:34.190 --> 03:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
awareness across the state so I think
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know rightfully so the committee
 
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
should be guarded for
 
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
um you know request that
 
03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
say there will be events and motions in
 
03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
place to support but then there's no
 
03:23:49.250 --> 03:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
mechanism to enact that
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
um I think in this case those efforts
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
are already being undertaken and in fact
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for is the state to
 
03:23:59.929 --> 03:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
put its stamp on approval
 
03:24:03.070 --> 03:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
um on this on this General
 
03:24:03.080 --> 03:24:04.849 align:start position:0%
um on this on this General
National

03:24:04.849 --> 03:24:04.859 align:start position:0%
National
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
effort like other states have done so
 
03:24:09.660 --> 03:24:10.670 align:start position:0%
effort like other states have done so
um

03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:12.290 --> 03:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think hopefully that answers your
 
03:24:15.110 --> 03:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
question it does thank you
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
or any any other questions comments yes
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
03:24:22.910 --> 03:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
so if I'm hearing correctly in order to
 
03:24:25.849 --> 03:24:25.859 align:start position:0%
achieve your objectives is it necessary
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
that November be designated as lung
 
03:24:31.490 --> 03:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
cancer month or could there be
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
um a house resolution supporting the
 
03:24:36.349 --> 03:24:36.359 align:start position:0%
efforts of the private sector in raising
 
03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
awareness of lung cancer and screening
 
03:24:38.279 --> 03:24:39.889 align:start position:0%
awareness of lung cancer and screening
opportunities

03:24:39.889 --> 03:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
03:24:41.570 --> 03:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
03:24:41.580 --> 03:24:43.070 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:24:45.410 --> 03:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
um my understanding through speaking
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
with these Physicians who are nationally
 
03:24:49.490 --> 03:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
based and practice the standards of care
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
for lung cancer disease is that
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's already a nationally recognized
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
month November every year and so that's
 
03:24:58.319 --> 03:24:59.450 align:start position:0%
month November every year and so that's
why

03:24:59.450 --> 03:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:25:01.610 --> 03:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
um we're tagging it for this upcoming
 
03:25:05.210 --> 03:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
November in this legislation so if it's
 
03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
a reoccurring National
 
03:25:07.080 --> 03:25:07.910 align:start position:0%
a reoccurring National
um

03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
awareness campaign that New Hampshire
 
03:25:11.929 --> 03:25:11.939 align:start position:0%
will with approval of this legislation
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
will join that effort by designating and
 
03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:16.849 align:start position:0%
will join that effort by designating and
declaring

03:25:16.849 --> 03:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
declaring
 
03:25:18.889 --> 03:25:18.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
so if it's already a national holiday
 
03:25:24.050 --> 03:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
and our physicians and treatment
 
03:25:26.150 --> 03:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
Specialists are already following those
 
03:25:28.250 --> 03:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
protocols would a resolution of the
 
03:25:30.050 --> 03:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
house to support the efforts of the
 
03:25:33.410 --> 03:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
private sector not support that National
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
month without having to name it and
 
03:25:39.290 --> 03:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
and get into this messy business of so
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
many holidays
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
that we're naming
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
last paragraph sorry yeah I'm trying to
 
03:25:57.889 --> 03:25:57.899 align:start position:0%
rephrase my response so
 
03:25:57.899 --> 03:25:58.969 align:start position:0%
rephrase my response so
um

03:25:58.969 --> 03:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:00.650 --> 03:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that there's any reason
 
03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
why we can't have a more generalized you
 
03:26:05.870 --> 03:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
know house resolution that just
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh kind of dampens down the
 
03:26:10.370 --> 03:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
particularity of when we would like to
 
03:26:12.410 --> 03:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
support lung cancer awareness
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure that the Physicians who
 
03:26:18.769 --> 03:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
support this legislation would also
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
support the general idea of lung cancer
 
03:26:23.389 --> 03:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
awareness at any time of the year I just
 
03:26:25.370 --> 03:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
we're trying our best to match up with
 
03:26:27.170 --> 03:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
what other states have done so that the
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
effort can be seen as a larger push
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
across the country so
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
um of course we are open and amenable to
 
03:26:36.410 --> 03:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
any recommended changes that you feel
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.769 --> 03:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
03:26:48.170 --> 03:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:48.180 --> 03:26:50.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:26:52.319 --> 03:26:54.110 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

03:26:54.110 --> 03:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
testify
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
see anybody
 
03:26:57.950 --> 03:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
in that case I'll close the public
 
03:27:02.690 --> 03:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:02.700 --> 03:27:05.090 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:27:05.090 --> 03:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:07.690 --> 03:27:07.700 align:start position:0%
without objection we can go into
 
03:27:10.990 --> 03:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
executive session and representative
 
03:27:14.330 --> 03:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
sanostaso do you have a motion
 
03:27:16.570 --> 03:27:16.580 align:start position:0%
uh thank you ma'am chair I move uh
 
03:27:20.090 --> 03:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
motion itl recommended itl for this bill
 
03:27:20.100 --> 03:27:22.010 align:start position:0%
motion itl recommended itl for this bill
uh

03:27:22.010 --> 03:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
03:27:26.690 --> 03:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
by representative true do you wish to
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative sentence uh yeah this is
 
03:27:34.490 --> 03:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
already a nationally recognized day and
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
I believe uh lung cancer is pretty well
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
known as a terrible disease uh the
 
03:27:43.969 --> 03:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
national Consciousness already
 
03:27:46.849 --> 03:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
um and that any that this kind of thing
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
isn't going to do anything to raise
 
03:27:49.610 --> 03:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
additional awareness
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's just going to be more uh more
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
statue that we're going to have to
 
03:27:54.000 --> 03:27:55.429 align:start position:0%
statue that we're going to have to
maintain

03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
03:27:58.849 --> 03:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh going along
 
03:28:04.429 --> 03:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
with those thoughts a screening for Lung
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
Care lung cancer that was testified is
 
03:28:07.490 --> 03:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
very low
 
03:28:10.070 --> 03:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
and uh lung cancer is a very deadly
 
03:28:10.080 --> 03:28:12.349 align:start position:0%
and uh lung cancer is a very deadly
disease

03:28:12.349 --> 03:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
disease
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
well I do not believe that by passing a
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
simple resolution we will be raising the
 
03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:19.729 align:start position:0%
simple resolution we will be raising the
awareness

03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
of these issues for anyone that it's uh
 
03:28:27.550 --> 03:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
it's really up to hospitals medical
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
organizations to uh to use their clout
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
to to increase awareness of this
 
03:28:35.809 --> 03:28:35.819 align:start position:0%
terrible disease
 
03:28:38.030 --> 03:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair does anyone else
 
03:28:41.690 --> 03:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
have a comment of Representative Bailey
 
03:28:44.650 --> 03:28:44.660 align:start position:0%
more like a question I guess I I know
 
03:28:46.790 --> 03:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
philosophically would generally kind of
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to these days
 
03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
but where this is a house resolution
 
03:28:54.290 --> 03:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
instead of a house bill does that change
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
things at all
 
03:28:57.530 --> 03:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
it means that it won't have to go to the
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
senate or the governor
 
03:29:02.210 --> 03:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh that's one thing does it change our
 
03:29:02.220 --> 03:29:03.469 align:start position:0%
uh that's one thing does it change our
view

03:29:03.469 --> 03:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
view
 
03:29:06.290 --> 03:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
well it's certainly better than putting
 
03:29:08.889 --> 03:29:08.899 align:start position:0%
it in statute because this is a one-time
 
03:29:13.130 --> 03:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
designation and it will not go into the
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
statutes uh to be permanent it just be
 
03:29:21.170 --> 03:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
listed as session law for one one time
 
03:29:24.530 --> 03:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
so yes it's slightly less of a problem
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
than some of the others
 
03:29:28.429 --> 03:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:29:32.450 --> 03:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so I I have a
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
thought that uh representative Hawkins
 
03:29:38.690 --> 03:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
Phillips has uh indicated uh a
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
willingness to come back to us with
 
03:29:43.389 --> 03:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
something that has
 
03:29:46.729 --> 03:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
more truthiness as I was calling it more
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
bite on the issue and uh I don't know
 
03:29:54.290 --> 03:29:54.300 align:start position:0%
that we're in any uh race to uh to get
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
the rid of this uh or to and to act on
 
03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
it in absence of uh of seeing what she
 
03:30:06.050 --> 03:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
might come up with so I'm disposed to
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
giving her a little bit of time to come
 
03:30:10.490 --> 03:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
back to us with something because I
 
03:30:12.530 --> 03:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
don't like the idea of putting things in
 
03:30:15.650 --> 03:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
statute but as you pointed out this
 
03:30:18.889 --> 03:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
gives us a little bit more
 
03:30:18.899 --> 03:30:19.670 align:start position:0%
gives us a little bit more
um

03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:22.130 --> 03:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
leeway thank you
 
03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative blackis thank you um
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's I mean it seems like the issue
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
is getting more people screened
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and I think there may be a better way
 
03:30:34.370 --> 03:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
to do it it was something suggested for
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier bills which is go to
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
the Board of Medicine I'll note that um
 
03:30:41.630 --> 03:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
you know there's an online for me for
 
03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
where I get insurance as an online thing
 
03:30:45.229 --> 03:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
reminding me to get various screenings
 
03:30:47.269 --> 03:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
and I've noticed there's not never been
 
03:30:48.830 --> 03:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
anything in there about lung cancer so
 
03:30:50.349 --> 03:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
03:30:53.210 --> 03:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
if it's that common and the screening is
 
03:30:55.130 --> 03:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
that valuable and it's not that
 
03:30:58.610 --> 03:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
difficult or expensive to do why isn't
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
that one of the screenings which is
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
regularly recommended and I think that
 
03:31:05.210 --> 03:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
would be a question for the Board of
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
Medicine not really anything we can do
 
03:31:09.050 --> 03:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
here and that'd be my suggestion rather
 
03:31:16.250 --> 03:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:31:18.359 --> 03:31:19.130 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:20.450 --> 03:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
with regards to it being a house
 
03:31:22.969 --> 03:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
resolution as opposed to a house bill it
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go to the Senate it also
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go to the governor
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
correct because it's just us I I'm sure
 
03:31:30.769 --> 03:31:30.779 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go to the Senate I I don't
 
03:31:32.210 --> 03:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
believe it goes to the governor right
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
which would give it even less of a
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
microphone than a bill would give it if
 
03:31:38.090 --> 03:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
it were to pass and my concern because
 
03:31:40.010 --> 03:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
obviously I think we're probably
 
03:31:41.809 --> 03:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
unanimous and are concerned that's been
 
03:31:43.550 --> 03:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
brought before us as far as the content
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
is concerned we're concerned about lung
 
03:31:47.210 --> 03:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
cancer awareness and things of that
 
03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
nature and I believe the representative
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
did an admirable job representing that
 
03:31:53.690 --> 03:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
today but if the goal is to provide a
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
microphone in order to help to
 
03:31:59.150 --> 03:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
promulgate that message a house
 
03:32:01.370 --> 03:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
resolution to my mind gives it even less
 
03:32:03.290 --> 03:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
of a platform less of a microphone than
 
03:32:05.450 --> 03:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
a house bill would give it
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
I would tend to agree that the house
 
03:32:10.610 --> 03:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
resolution doesn't
 
03:32:12.830 --> 03:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
get a whole lot of attention outside of
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
the house and and unfortunately there
 
03:32:16.670 --> 03:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
are very few active physicians in the
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
house most of them are retired so we we
 
03:32:22.370 --> 03:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
may be aware but I don't know who else
 
03:32:24.889 --> 03:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
would be affected by it
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:32:28.969 --> 03:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:32:31.910 --> 03:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you again one thing that occurs to
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
me that is referenced in the whereas
 
03:32:37.729 --> 03:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
Clauses at one point in any case that we
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
should all be aware of and that is the
 
03:32:42.889 --> 03:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is an as extremely high
 
03:32:46.809 --> 03:32:46.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.650 --> 03:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
prevalence uh the granite state is a it
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
is a nice terminology but it has its
 
03:32:59.090 --> 03:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
downsides as well so uh radon screening
 
03:33:01.130 --> 03:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
is something that we could all benefit
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
from having greater consciousness of so
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
that something I wanted to bring to the
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
committee's attention
 
03:33:11.990 --> 03:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
I would agree and
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
as representative leckis mentioned the
 
03:33:17.330 --> 03:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
the insurance the
 
03:33:20.570 --> 03:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
your insurance tends to say
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know get your colonoscopy get your
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
flu shot get your uh get your mammogram
 
03:33:28.429 --> 03:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
get this get you know this screening us
 
03:33:32.510 --> 03:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
process and why why aren't they
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
encouraging us to get
 
03:33:35.040 --> 03:33:35.809 align:start position:0%
encouraging us to get
um

03:33:35.809 --> 03:33:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
lung cancer screening
 
03:33:40.849 --> 03:33:40.859 align:start position:0%
which will probably be paid as much
 
03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
attention to as we do all the others but
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
but at least they should be asking for
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
it and the primary care physicians are
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
the ones who need to to be aware that
 
03:33:53.870 --> 03:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
they should ask for it
 
03:33:56.090 --> 03:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
particularly as you say in the state in
 
03:33:58.010 --> 03:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
the granite state where radon is
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately prevalent
 
03:34:06.349 --> 03:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none the motion is inexpedient
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
to legislate by representative sandton
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
assasso seconded by representative true
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
and the clerk can call the role
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
now take a vote rule for house
 
03:34:24.769 --> 03:34:24.779 align:start position:0%

so with the vote to 1801
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
18 D.A one day
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%

objection to consent
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
03:35:53.570 --> 03:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
no one objects we'll put it on consent
 
03:35:53.580 --> 03:35:56.330 align:start position:0%
no one objects we'll put it on consent
and

03:35:56.330 --> 03:35:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:59.929 --> 03:35:59.939 align:start position:0%
leave the executive session and we have
 
03:36:04.370 --> 03:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
a few minutes before the next bill 145.
 
03:36:04.380 --> 03:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
a few minutes before the next bill 145.

03:46:45.600 --> 03:46:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
 
03:46:50.469 --> 03:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
welcome back to Edna
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
we are now have the hearing on House
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 140 and I call Representative
 
03:46:57.359 --> 03:47:10.450 align:start position:0%
Bill 140 and I call Representative
Horrigan

03:47:10.450 --> 03:47:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.130 --> 03:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
I also have some written testimony which
 
03:47:13.140 --> 03:47:13.849 align:start position:0%
I also have some written testimony which
I'm

03:47:13.849 --> 03:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
passing around in which I uh also uh
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
also submitted through the website to
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the remote sign-in feature but I have no
 
03:47:24.710 --> 03:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
idea what happens if anything happens to
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
those files that are submitted perhaps
 
03:47:28.450 --> 03:47:28.460 align:start position:0%
you have from your email box
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon uh for bringing
 
03:47:33.650 --> 03:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
the the testimony yeah I appreciate that
 
03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
the uh we have been checking the online
 
03:47:39.530 --> 03:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
sign ups because we've had some from our
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
last build
 
03:47:41.279 --> 03:47:42.889 align:start position:0%
last build
um

03:47:42.889 --> 03:47:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you and a couple of typos
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
prepped into the file I think sometimes
 
03:47:49.309 --> 03:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
you I think sometimes they like the bits
 
03:47:50.690 --> 03:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
rearrange themselves after you think
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
you're done with it but nasty things
 
03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:53.750 align:start position:0%
you're done with it but nasty things
anyway

03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
03:47:56.330 --> 03:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
and um somebody didn't say much about on
 
03:47:58.969 --> 03:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
the bill which is what it actually
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
what it actually does it makes one
 
03:48:02.809 --> 03:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
simple there's about
 
03:48:05.090 --> 03:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
there's about 30 different days weeks
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
and months
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
which are um
 
03:48:12.130 --> 03:48:12.140 align:start position:0%
which are mentioned in RSA
 
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
rsa4 they started I think with RSA 13 a
 
03:48:17.870 --> 03:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
and go through DD and this would add
 
03:48:20.330 --> 03:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
another one so this doesn't uh cost
 
03:48:22.910 --> 03:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
anything it's just uh instructs the
 
03:48:24.950 --> 03:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
governor to issue a proclamation every
 
03:48:26.929 --> 03:48:26.939 align:start position:0%
year in advance of her birthday which is
 
03:48:26.939 --> 03:48:28.010 align:start position:0%
year in advance of her birthday which is
a

03:48:28.010 --> 03:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:48:31.250 --> 03:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
January 24th her 113th birthday is
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
coming up in a few days
 
03:48:35.090 --> 03:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:48:36.889 --> 03:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
and does feel very much like she's still
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
alive even though she passed away and at
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
the age of 100 in 2010 so that's what
 
03:48:44.809 --> 03:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
the bill does we have a lot of other
 
03:48:47.570 --> 03:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
weeks months and days and this just adds
 
03:48:49.370 --> 03:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
one more of the list and I think she
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
very much deserves it she's one of the
 
03:48:52.729 --> 03:48:52.739 align:start position:0%
greatest people the most influential
 
03:48:55.429 --> 03:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
people ever to come out of New Hampshire
 
03:48:55.439 --> 03:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
people ever to come out of New Hampshire
um

03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:59.210 --> 03:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I guess I started with my second
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
paragraph actually she's a rebel with
 
03:49:04.510 --> 03:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
the cause
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay you don't want me to read please
 
03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
don't know read
 
03:49:08.929 --> 03:49:08.939 align:start position:0%
it yeah
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
borrow check in this community and
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
everybody can read okay cool
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:49:17.150 --> 03:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so she's
 
03:49:19.790 --> 03:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
famous for a number of things um when
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're 100 years old especially a
 
03:49:23.450 --> 03:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
distinguished a life you see is she did
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
lots of things but she's most famous for
 
03:49:25.560 --> 03:49:26.570 align:start position:0%
lots of things but she's most famous for
uh

03:49:26.570 --> 03:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:49:28.610 --> 03:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
marching across the country she started
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
on New Year's Day in 1999 at the Rose
 
03:49:33.650 --> 03:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
Bowl Parade in Pasadena California March
 
03:49:38.150 --> 03:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh 3 200 miles uh mostly on foot she had
 
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
to do uh some of it by by cross country
 
03:49:43.250 --> 03:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
ski because there was a snowstorm in
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
West Virginia and Virginia when she
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
arrived 14 months later and then um
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
so she uh
 
03:49:52.610 --> 03:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
eventually uh made to the Capitol
 
03:49:55.849 --> 03:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
um she was arrested there for joined a
 
03:49:57.710 --> 03:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
group of 220 other people but all they
 
03:49:59.269 --> 03:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
were doing was reading the Declaration
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
of Independence and she also
 
03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
successfully uh lobbied
 
03:50:06.349 --> 03:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
for uh more campaign Finance reform
 
03:50:08.450 --> 03:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
because uh that was what that was what
 
03:50:10.849 --> 03:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
her walk was about raising at wherements
 
03:50:12.590 --> 03:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
that you know we need the people should
 
03:50:14.630 --> 03:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
be choosing uh
 
03:50:16.729 --> 03:50:16.739 align:start position:0%
so all the people should be choosing our
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
our elected leaders not just those with
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
the most money not just the corporations
 
03:50:21.359 --> 03:50:22.429 align:start position:0%
the most money not just the corporations
um

03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:23.929 --> 03:50:23.939 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:50:28.250 --> 03:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
January 6 2023 I happened to attend uh a
 
03:50:29.929 --> 03:50:29.939 align:start position:0%
zoom remembrance vigil which is about
 
03:50:31.370 --> 03:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
all the events that followed the
 
03:50:33.530 --> 03:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
election in 2020 and we all remember
 
03:50:35.330 --> 03:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
those who have different opinions about
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
them but it was a pretty frightening and
 
03:50:36.720 --> 03:50:37.729 align:start position:0%
them but it was a pretty frightening and
hopeful

03:50:37.729 --> 03:50:37.739 align:start position:0%
hopeful
 
03:50:40.010 --> 03:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
time and that became a nation night
 
03:50:42.830 --> 03:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
webinar at first they had uh
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
so that was at 8 30 p.m on that Friday
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
night which 5 30 p.m the west coast is
 
03:50:49.130 --> 03:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
around when the sun sets but anyway
 
03:50:51.530 --> 03:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
after a speech by the Nationwide
 
03:50:54.050 --> 03:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
president of the League of Women Voters
 
03:50:56.110 --> 03:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
whose name I have here Virginia
 
03:50:58.729 --> 03:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
Solomon then one of the local chapters
 
03:51:00.469 --> 03:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
this was uh
 
03:51:03.110 --> 03:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
in Alabama County which is uh as most
 
03:51:04.729 --> 03:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
you probably know the east side of San
 
03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
Francisco Bay the East Bay Area and the
 
03:51:08.809 --> 03:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
first she spent most of her time about a
 
03:51:10.610 --> 03:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
five minute March talking about how she
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
was inspired by uh
 
03:51:15.290 --> 03:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
a woman from New Hampshire Doris granny
 
03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
D haddock so she's not just a legend
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but a legend
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and even worldwide so that's
 
03:51:25.010 --> 03:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh another reason to remember her so uh
 
03:51:26.570 --> 03:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
her presence is strong not just in
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
California or New Hampshire so she's
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
very much alive in our memories and the
 
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill will keep
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
your memory alive and uh
 
03:51:38.090 --> 03:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
my written testimony does close with the
 
03:51:40.130 --> 03:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
some remarks she made down whether you
 
03:51:41.330 --> 03:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
want me to read them now or do you want
 
03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:42.229 align:start position:0%
want me to read them now or do you want
me

03:51:42.229 --> 03:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
no thank you okay you can all uh you can
 
03:51:48.050 --> 03:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
all read it now and it's available on
 
03:51:50.690 --> 03:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
your Wikipedia article too but uh and I
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
I couldn't have said it as uh I couldn't
 
03:51:55.370 --> 03:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
have said it as eloquently as as she did
 
03:51:56.929 --> 03:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
she's probably
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
probably I think the greatest person
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
I've didn't get to know as well as I
 
03:52:01.729 --> 03:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
should have but I I had the honor of
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
getting to know her uh you know very
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
late in her life and probably the
 
03:52:07.429 --> 03:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
greatest person I've ever
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
I've ever I've ever met you know greater
 
03:52:11.750 --> 03:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
even than President Obama or the Jazz
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
drummer Dizzy Gillespie um so I think
 
03:52:16.130 --> 03:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
you know see and it's also proved a lot
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
just what you know
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
what just an ordinary citizen can do you
 
03:52:22.670 --> 03:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
know she was just a uh an ordinary uh
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
well she wasn't just a granny she was
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know she was
 
03:52:28.610 --> 03:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
she led a very long 100 year long life
 
03:52:31.190 --> 03:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
and she was many things and then
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
last thing I was going to say like her
 
03:52:36.910 --> 03:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
100th birthday party uh that was uh
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
she was about nine years old when women
 
03:52:41.570 --> 03:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
got the right to vote so she was born in
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
1910 and that was passed in 1919 and she
 
03:52:48.170 --> 03:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
very you know she wasn't just a simple
 
03:52:50.210 --> 03:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
granny from Dublin she was a very you
 
03:52:53.090 --> 03:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
know very candy uh for any candy show
 
03:52:54.530 --> 03:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
woman you know very talented
 
03:52:56.150 --> 03:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
entrepreneur you know very very good
 
03:52:58.190 --> 03:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
politician so she
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
made sure that she was introduced by a
 
03:53:03.410 --> 03:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
young woman I believe from in her
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
community but somewhere around who is
 
03:53:06.650 --> 03:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
about the same who was about nine years
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
old the same age she was
 
03:53:09.420 --> 03:53:10.370 align:start position:0%
old the same age she was
um

03:53:10.370 --> 03:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
the same way same way she was the same
 
03:53:14.570 --> 03:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
way she was when we passed the women's
 
03:53:16.010 --> 03:53:16.020 align:start position:0%
right to vote and that kind of reminded
 
03:53:18.710 --> 03:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
me of how short life was how recent you
 
03:53:20.690 --> 03:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
know historical events happened you know
 
03:53:22.190 --> 03:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
we take the women's right to vote to
 
03:53:24.050 --> 03:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
granted and lots of other rights but you
 
03:53:24.060 --> 03:53:24.769 align:start position:0%
granted and lots of other rights but you
know

03:53:24.769 --> 03:53:24.779 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:53:27.290 --> 03:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
just within uh
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
granny D's lifetime which is longer than
 
03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
most people but still not really a long
 
03:53:32.210 --> 03:53:32.220 align:start position:0%
time in the larger schemes of things
 
03:53:34.190 --> 03:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
women did not have the right to vote and
 
03:53:36.590 --> 03:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of other rights
 
03:53:38.150 --> 03:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
um that were taken for granted today
 
03:53:40.729 --> 03:53:40.739 align:start position:0%
which uh people didn't have back then or
 
03:53:44.269 --> 03:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
even uh long into her lifetime so I urge
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
you to uh urge you to add add this to
 
03:53:49.610 --> 03:53:49.620 align:start position:0%
the long list of other uh
 
03:53:51.710 --> 03:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
other other things which the governor
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
proclaims every year I think it's uh
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
probably the most important of all those
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
20 proclamations so um
 
03:54:00.170 --> 03:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
with that I closed my testimony and of
 
03:54:01.370 --> 03:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
course if you have to take any questions
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
so eloquent that you've answered all our
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
questions yeah oh well I hope so like
 
03:54:17.690 --> 03:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised to hear that but you never
 
03:54:19.070 --> 03:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
know anything can happen thanks a lot
 
03:54:19.080 --> 03:54:21.290 align:start position:0%

03:54:27.530 --> 03:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon my name is Olivia Zink
 
03:54:31.309 --> 03:54:31.319 align:start position:0%

which is an organization a New Hampshire
 
03:54:38.510 --> 03:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
organization that Granny D founded
 
03:54:38.520 --> 03:54:39.170 align:start position:0%
organization that Granny D founded
um

03:54:39.170 --> 03:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I I brought with me some materials
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
um some of the books that have been
 
03:54:46.910 --> 03:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
written about granny D
 
03:54:48.530 --> 03:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
um but I also just wanted to sort of
 
03:54:50.929 --> 03:54:50.939 align:start position:0%
speak to a couple of things
 
03:54:52.370 --> 03:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
um one
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
um this is a really important issue
 
03:54:57.889 --> 03:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
um to just not only honor the woman her
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
hundred years of life
 
03:55:02.990 --> 03:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
um there's there's some items in
 
03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:03.590 align:start position:0%
um there's there's some items in
um

03:55:03.590 --> 03:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation but also she
 
03:55:09.849 --> 03:55:09.859 align:start position:0%
did work in Alaska with Native American
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
folks around nuclear weapons and nuclear
 
03:55:16.070 --> 03:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
proliferation she did work to ensure
 
03:55:19.250 --> 03:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
that there was a 101 going through uh
 
03:55:23.689 --> 03:55:23.699 align:start position:0%
over to Keene she worked with the Mills
 
03:55:25.849 --> 03:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
the mill women that she worked with
 
03:55:28.610 --> 03:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
making shoes in Manchester she was born
 
03:55:33.170 --> 03:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
in Laconia so she she really was a
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
remarkable woman for her hundred years I
 
03:55:38.090 --> 03:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
was looking back through the state
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
archives at Keene State College that has
 
03:55:43.969 --> 03:55:43.979 align:start position:0%
comments from Newt Gingrich and John
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
McCain and Warren Rudman about this
 
03:55:49.490 --> 03:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
woman granny D so she not only touched
 
03:55:52.370 --> 03:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
Democrats which was the party she
 
03:55:54.769 --> 03:55:54.779 align:start position:0%
belonged to but she touched people
 
03:55:57.650 --> 03:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
across the political Spectrum in her
 
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
work USA Today did declare her one of
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
the top 10 women of um so I have a link
 
03:56:09.050 --> 03:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
to that if anyone's interested I first
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
met her after she walked across the
 
03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:12.769 align:start position:0%
met her after she walked across the
country

03:56:12.769 --> 03:56:12.779 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:56:12.779 --> 03:56:13.429 align:start position:0%
country
um

03:56:13.429 --> 03:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
and she was really able to connect
 
03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
issues that I cared about around safe
 
03:56:19.610 --> 03:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
and clean drinking water
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
um to the issues of democracy and why it
 
03:56:25.849 --> 03:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
mattered to vote and why it mattered to
 
03:56:27.769 --> 03:56:27.779 align:start position:0%
be paying attention and be civically
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
involved and I think she inspired women
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
she uh stood in for a woman who was a
 
03:56:38.809 --> 03:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
mermaid in an amusement park so that
 
03:56:41.090 --> 03:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
that woman could register to vote so
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's lots of different things that
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
Granny D did that were really historic
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
and also just really remarkable
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
she always wore a feather in her hat
 
03:56:55.319 --> 03:56:56.030 align:start position:0%
she always wore a feather in her hat
um

03:56:56.030 --> 03:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
and was sort of known by this hat that
 
03:57:00.889 --> 03:57:00.899 align:start position:0%
she wore on her head if you've if you
 
03:57:03.010 --> 03:57:03.020 align:start position:0%
met with her walked with her
 
03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
and I I wanted to share a remark by her
 
03:57:10.010 --> 03:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
family when she decided at age 88 to
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
start her walk 10 miles a day across the
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
country her family said Nana are you
 
03:57:17.150 --> 03:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
sure about this do we need to to take
 
03:57:19.849 --> 03:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
you to the doctors are you okay and she
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
was so strong in her conviction she
 
03:57:24.050 --> 03:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
really wanted to walk 10 miles a day for
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
this cause and and really talk to others
 
03:57:30.950 --> 03:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
about that I do have testimony from a
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
Peterborough resident who was unable to
 
03:57:37.070 --> 03:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
be here today due to a health concern so
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
I will share John windham's testimony
 
03:57:43.010 --> 03:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I wanted to say is
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
that I just got word the governor signed
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
this year's Proclamation so this year's
 
03:57:49.370 --> 03:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
Proclamation was signed by Chris sununu
 
03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the granny D Day on June in two
 
03:57:54.889 --> 03:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
weeks but I I will say that I know that
 
03:57:57.290 --> 03:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
this that and anyone can request a
 
03:58:00.530 --> 03:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
proclamation but Ruth and and many of
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
the women who knew granny D Have and
 
03:58:06.170 --> 03:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
Have Been requesting this Proclamation
 
03:58:08.450 --> 03:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
are getting older they're now 90 years
 
03:58:10.969 --> 03:58:10.979 align:start position:0%
old too they knew her 20 years ago and I
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
think that as somebody who has passed
 
03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:14.689 align:start position:0%
think that as somebody who has passed
away

03:58:14.689 --> 03:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
away
 
03:58:14.699 --> 03:58:15.530 align:start position:0%
away
um

03:58:15.530 --> 03:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
you know and and who would have been
 
03:58:19.969 --> 03:58:19.979 align:start position:0%
112. the number of people they actually
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
touched gets less and less each year so
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's important to pass these pieces of
 
03:58:27.950 --> 03:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
legislation because not always will
 
03:58:29.929 --> 03:58:29.939 align:start position:0%
there be somebody who remembers her or
 
03:58:31.729 --> 03:58:31.739 align:start position:0%
knew her
 
03:58:31.739 --> 03:58:32.450 align:start position:0%
knew her
um

03:58:32.450 --> 03:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:34.849 --> 03:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
to request a proclamation in the future
 
03:58:36.769 --> 03:58:36.779 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
 
03:58:36.779 --> 03:58:38.750 align:start position:0%
and with that I'm happy to take any
questions

03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:58:40.729 --> 03:58:40.739 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
03:58:40.739 --> 03:58:42.130 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
representative

03:58:42.130 --> 03:58:42.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:58:45.229 --> 03:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
I mean you're mentioning the people that
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
knew her
 
03:58:47.640 --> 03:58:48.469 align:start position:0%
knew her
um

03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
have passed but there are memorials for
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
people who are you know died much longer
 
03:58:55.370 --> 03:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
ago and people considered important I
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
would hope somebody else would take up
 
03:58:59.809 --> 03:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
that cause
 
03:58:59.819 --> 03:59:00.530 align:start position:0%
that cause
um

03:59:00.530 --> 03:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:02.450 --> 03:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if having a you know an
 
03:59:04.849 --> 03:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
active group trying to promote this on a
 
03:59:07.130 --> 03:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
regular basis rather than something
 
03:59:08.929 --> 03:59:08.939 align:start position:0%
sitting in statute might be more
 
03:59:10.429 --> 03:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
effective I mean is there a group of
 
03:59:12.590 --> 03:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
people that you know beyond these people
 
03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
who asked for a proclamation and
 
03:59:15.710 --> 03:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
organize any kind of events in the state
 
03:59:15.720 --> 03:59:17.570 align:start position:0%
organize any kind of events in the state
to

03:59:17.570 --> 03:59:17.580 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:59:20.929 --> 03:59:20.939 align:start position:0%
um you know commemorate her and and uh
 
03:59:23.090 --> 03:59:23.100 align:start position:0%
and and you know keep her memory alive
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there's a
 
03:59:26.880 --> 03:59:27.410 align:start position:0%
yeah I think there's a
there's

03:59:27.410 --> 03:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:59:29.090 --> 03:59:29.100 align:start position:0%
um want to keep her memory alive and I
 
03:59:31.729 --> 03:59:31.739 align:start position:0%
invite you to join us on January 24th at
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
7 pm uh to hear from people who knew
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
granny D
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
um want to kind of Honor her so there is
 
03:59:41.450 --> 03:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
a zoom presentation that I can send you
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
a link to if you're interested
 
03:59:47.090 --> 03:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
um but I think that when I first got
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
involved with uh open democracy and
 
03:59:52.969 --> 03:59:52.979 align:start position:0%
Granny D A lot of people knew her worked
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
with her and I will just say in the last
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
10 years many of those people I worked
 
04:00:02.870 --> 04:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
with have passed away and and the people
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
who she walked across the country 20
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
years ago so somebody said to me oh she
 
04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
walked across the country before I was
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
alive and so I do think that it is
 
04:00:12.600 --> 04:00:13.849 align:start position:0%
alive and so I do think that it is
important

04:00:13.849 --> 04:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:00:13.859 --> 04:00:14.689 align:start position:0%
important
um

04:00:14.689 --> 04:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:18.290 --> 04:00:18.300 align:start position:0%
to remember and and honor folks but
 
04:00:20.090 --> 04:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
having it in Statue where the governor
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
issues this automatically instead of
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
having it be requested each year
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
um does show that she's a prominent
 
04:00:26.640 --> 04:00:27.710 align:start position:0%
um does show that she's a prominent
woman

04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
woman
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I I failed to mention in my testimony

executive session
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Broder you have a motion
 
04:03:34.610 --> 04:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
yes Madam chair I vote I make a motion
 
04:03:37.550 --> 04:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
to itl house bill 140.
 
04:03:43.550 --> 04:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%

did you speak to your motion
yes

04:03:55.550 --> 04:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.429 --> 04:03:58.439 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that Community was an
 
04:03:59.689 --> 04:03:59.699 align:start position:0%
important person in New Hampshire
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:08.150 --> 04:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:08.160 --> 04:04:09.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:04:09.050 --> 04:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:13.010 --> 04:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.290 --> 04:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
as a committee
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
we have not supported these kinds of
 
04:04:20.330 --> 04:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
legislation because
 
04:04:20.340 --> 04:04:23.389 align:start position:0%
legislation because
it

04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.729 --> 04:04:25.739 align:start position:0%
just to trigger
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
a proclamation every year
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't really bring is not a meaningful
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
nor is it a
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to
 
04:04:39.889 --> 04:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
honor such a person
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
if they want if you you know I think
 
04:04:45.469 --> 04:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
that the towns that she lived in having
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
a having festivals having
 
04:04:48.840 --> 04:04:50.389 align:start position:0%
a having festivals having
um

04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:52.969 --> 04:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
organizations like Urban democracy that
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
continue to do her work is important but
 
04:04:57.769 --> 04:04:57.779 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
04:05:02.210 --> 04:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
believe that this committee can has
 
04:05:02.220 --> 04:05:03.410 align:start position:0%
believe that this committee can has
um

04:05:03.410 --> 04:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
I know I'm sorry I'm getting distracted
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
by all this paper
 
04:05:08.210 --> 04:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe this bill
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be helpful to prolong her
 
04:05:14.689 --> 04:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
name which I think is what you're trying
 
04:05:18.769 --> 04:05:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.510 --> 04:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative beard you wish
 
04:05:22.969 --> 04:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
to speak to your second
 
04:05:25.450 --> 04:05:25.460 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to say something
 
04:05:29.330 --> 04:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
well I'm sure I'm not the only one on
 
04:05:36.349 --> 04:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
the committee but I'm one of the members
 
04:05:38.450 --> 04:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
of the committee I certainly who did
 
04:05:41.150 --> 04:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
know Granny D and interacted with her a
 
04:05:44.090 --> 04:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
number of times over the years of her
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
most public uh
 
04:05:50.570 --> 04:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
Mission if you will and I heard her
 
04:05:55.809 --> 04:05:55.819 align:start position:0%
speak she was a powerful orator I I
 
04:05:58.070 --> 04:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
campaigned with her on a number of
 
04:06:00.650 --> 04:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
occasions and I was there on her 100th
 
04:06:04.809 --> 04:06:04.819 align:start position:0%
birthday so uh I defer to no one in my
 
04:06:07.370 --> 04:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
respect for her significant
 
04:06:11.689 --> 04:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
accomplishments I think in in in in a
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
way it is more meaningful that uh that
 
04:06:19.610 --> 04:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
the governor is voluntarily uh
 
04:06:22.429 --> 04:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
proclaiming her birthday
 
04:06:23.929 --> 04:06:23.939 align:start position:0%
um every
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
um every January
 
04:06:31.250 --> 04:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
um and and I think as long as uh as long
 
04:06:33.650 --> 04:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
as she's still a present figure in many
 
04:06:33.660 --> 04:06:35.269 align:start position:0%
as she's still a present figure in many
respects

04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
respects
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
um that uh that that aspect is
 
04:06:38.580 --> 04:06:40.130 align:start position:0%
um that uh that that aspect is
appropriate

04:06:40.130 --> 04:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:06:43.429 --> 04:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
um and and there are countless people in
 
04:06:46.370 --> 04:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
this state as well as hundreds of
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
thousands in this country uh who have
 
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
had lives of Fame and accomplishment uh
 
04:06:53.220 --> 04:06:55.010 align:start position:0%
had lives of Fame and accomplishment uh
and

04:06:55.010 --> 04:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
um and the history books record them to
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
various degrees uh so I think it's more
 
04:07:04.849 --> 04:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
important to have a voluntary thing than
 
04:07:07.250 --> 04:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
to put it in the stature to be buried
 
04:07:08.570 --> 04:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
because when
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
when she's forgotten by most people
 
04:07:16.130 --> 04:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
because her her that era has passed uh
 
04:07:19.490 --> 04:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
then then only the history books will
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
record her uh in the meantime she has a
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
limiting Memorial and that's the uh the
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh organization that Miss zinc referred
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
to so I'm I'm going to reluctantly vote
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
Yes on this Ito motion because I think
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
we should keep her alive with something
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
alive and not something that's a dead
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
letter of sorts in the stature book
 
04:07:44.279 --> 04:07:46.670 align:start position:0%
letter of sorts in the stature book
Thank

04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:50.150 --> 04:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
any other representative like us yeah
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
um what I would have said is uh already
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
mostly been said by the uh previous two
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
speakers I agree completely the only
 
04:07:58.849 --> 04:07:58.859 align:start position:0%
thing I would add is you know I applaud
 
04:08:01.010 --> 04:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
um the people that are organizing uh the
 
04:08:02.330 --> 04:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
events that are going on and I think
 
04:08:04.849 --> 04:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
that's both the appropriate and the
 
04:08:07.010 --> 04:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
effective way of uh of keeping her
 
04:08:08.809 --> 04:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
memory alive and I think that's great
 
04:08:11.809 --> 04:08:11.819 align:start position:0%

I learned about her I can't imagine
 
04:08:25.210 --> 04:08:25.220 align:start position:0%
she's ever going to be forgotten
 
04:08:28.490 --> 04:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
because you keep her alive
 
04:08:28.500 --> 04:08:30.229 align:start position:0%
because you keep her alive

New Hampshire if you get a chance to see

04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair so I
 
04:33:31.789 --> 04:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
continue to be and I don't think I said
 
04:33:33.410 --> 04:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
this at the first time representative
 
04:33:35.631 --> 04:33:35.641 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horrigan that represents
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
Stratford County District 10 with the
 
04:33:38.570 --> 04:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
towns of Durham
 
04:33:38.580 --> 04:33:39.470 align:start position:0%
towns of Durham
um

04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:41.810 --> 04:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
Durham is also although this is a
 
04:33:43.490 --> 04:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
tradition that fell by the wayside a few
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
years ago the home of the Leif Ericsson
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
Day celebration which is always on the
 
04:33:52.131 --> 04:33:52.141 align:start position:0%
Sunday before uh which I guess the
 
04:33:53.869 --> 04:33:53.879 align:start position:0%
second Monday in October which is
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
currently a fish and the reason they
 
04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
picked that day was because they have no
 
04:33:59.990 --> 04:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
idea what day late Erickson arrived and
 
04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh in Greenland but they know it was
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
before Columbus that's why they picked
 
04:34:06.650 --> 04:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
that Sunday but anyway
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a pretty simple build the
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
issues behind it are complicated it
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
changes the name of the existing
 
04:34:14.209 --> 04:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
mid-october holiday held on the second
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
Monday in October from Columbus Day to
 
04:34:19.551 --> 04:34:19.561 align:start position:0%
indigenous people stay in this um
 
04:34:21.769 --> 04:34:21.779 align:start position:0%
Monday's been celebrated unofficially
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
and even officially in many communities
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
and school districts as indigenous
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
people stay for a number of years in
 
04:34:29.170 --> 04:34:29.180 align:start position:0%
fact I think it's become a more
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
significant celebration than Columbus
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
Day and we can continue to be a
 
04:34:34.369 --> 04:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
highlight of the yearless calendar what
 
04:34:37.609 --> 04:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
happens uh you know this year to HP 180
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I certainly hope you'll pass it as
 
04:34:42.109 --> 04:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
is I think the time has come for it um
 
04:34:44.330 --> 04:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
and speaking just for myself that's my
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
goal to rename the mid-october holidays
 
04:34:47.631 --> 04:34:47.641 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
I want to continue having a holiday on
 
04:34:52.369 --> 04:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
the second Monday in October and I want
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
to be officially named after the native
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
peoples of North America and also if if
 
04:34:58.910 --> 04:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
possible I want to be named after
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
Christopher not to be named after
 
04:35:02.209 --> 04:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
Christopher Columbus and there's
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
probably a lot of
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
reasons why they established the
 
04:35:09.051 --> 04:35:09.061 align:start position:0%
Columbus holiday but um I think
 
04:35:10.789 --> 04:35:10.799 align:start position:0%
I think they're not valid anymore he
 
04:35:12.650 --> 04:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
wasn't even um
 
04:35:14.449 --> 04:35:14.459 align:start position:0%
yeah didn't didn't become an official
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
holidays in 1971 so I think the right
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing to do now in 2023 is uh
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
keep that same holiday but make us a
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day and of course to go back to
 
04:35:25.789 --> 04:35:25.799 align:start position:0%
Columbus we were probably all well I
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
guess I don't know what goes on great
 
04:35:29.929 --> 04:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
schools in or recent years but at least
 
04:35:31.310 --> 04:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
if you're my age we all learned in grade
 
04:35:33.551 --> 04:35:33.561 align:start position:0%
school that he discovered American
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
1492 but of course the millions of
 
04:35:37.730 --> 04:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
people living in the Americas in 1492
 
04:35:40.250 --> 04:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
were already well aware that America
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
existed of
 
04:35:43.670 --> 04:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:35:46.131 --> 04:35:46.141 align:start position:0%
Columbus himself
 
04:35:47.689 --> 04:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
Columbus himself was not the first
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
European to travel to North America and
 
04:35:52.189 --> 04:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
actually it turns out he wasn't even
 
04:35:54.289 --> 04:35:54.299 align:start position:0%
really surprised to find land where he
 
04:35:56.029 --> 04:35:56.039 align:start position:0%
he found it so he had a pretty accurate
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
idea of how wide the Atlantic Ocean was
 
04:36:02.810 --> 04:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
he had a pretty good idea that land
 
04:36:04.910 --> 04:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
would be where he found it and that was
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
for various reasons including the fact
 
04:36:08.209 --> 04:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
that many Europeans had
 
04:36:10.250 --> 04:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
been there before and he's presumably
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
been talking for example the Portuguese
 
04:36:13.670 --> 04:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
fishermen who were fishing off the grant
 
04:36:16.010 --> 04:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
Banks and so forth so
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
um best known example I mentioned Leif
 
04:36:20.209 --> 04:36:20.219 align:start position:0%
Erickson Leif Erickson was one of the
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
first uh one of the
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe wasn't the first one but here's
 
04:36:27.650 --> 04:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
one of the Scandinavians who established
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
a very well documented colony in
 
04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
Greenland which survived for 500 years
 
04:36:35.390 --> 04:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
beginning in the mid 900s and it uh
 
04:36:38.209 --> 04:36:38.219 align:start position:0%
ended uh well there's conflict in
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
Warfare and bad things to happen along
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
the way but it was relatively relatively
 
04:36:43.609 --> 04:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
peaceful not really all that long before
 
04:36:46.010 --> 04:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
Columbus's day when the dissented the
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
original Colonnade is
 
04:36:50.349 --> 04:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
they served reverse migrated back to
 
04:36:52.730 --> 04:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
Scandinavia in the mid-1400s and that
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
was because of uh the climate had become
 
04:36:58.131 --> 04:36:58.141 align:start position:0%
cooler the economy in Europe had
 
04:36:59.929 --> 04:36:59.939 align:start position:0%
collapsed and there's anyway there's
 
04:37:01.730 --> 04:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
more up they decided there's more
 
04:37:03.890 --> 04:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to go back to their
 
04:37:06.170 --> 04:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
ancestors Homeland rather than the stay
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
where they were and they were probably
 
04:37:10.730 --> 04:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
Scandinavians and uh in other parts of
 
04:37:12.529 --> 04:37:12.539 align:start position:0%
North America and actually
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of the first accounts is a I'm of
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
Irish ancestors one of the first
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
accounts was a group of Irish monks led
 
04:37:22.730 --> 04:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
by Saint Brenton so they that was uh
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
that was like a couple hundred years at
 
04:37:27.410 --> 04:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
least before uh late barrickson's time
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
so we were not Columbus was certainly
 
04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
not the first person to cross the
 
04:37:33.949 --> 04:37:33.959 align:start position:0%
Atlanta across the Atlantic and also
 
04:37:36.051 --> 04:37:36.061 align:start position:0%
people came to North America from uh
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
from Asia Russians came there uh
 
04:37:42.289 --> 04:37:42.299 align:start position:0%
uh Chinese uh probably came to uh
 
04:37:45.410 --> 04:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
Central America so the Polynesians uh
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
you know came from came from Hawaii
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
which is now one of the United States
 
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
actually so
 
04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
and um so I mentioned that Columbus
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
wasn't Italian he's from the Republic of
 
04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
Genoa which is a small country which uh
 
04:37:59.150 --> 04:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
cease to exist three and a half
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
centuries after Columbus's time when it
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
was basically split up between France
 
04:38:06.289 --> 04:38:06.299 align:start position:0%
and France and Italy and Genoa is now a
 
04:38:09.769 --> 04:38:09.779 align:start position:0%
Italian city but um he spoke a language
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
called ligurian which people still speak
 
04:38:13.250 --> 04:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
but it's more closely related to the
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
French and Italian he's been most of his
 
04:38:17.209 --> 04:38:17.219 align:start position:0%
life in Spain and Portugal so he was not
 
04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
actually Italian
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
really not really Italian at all he was
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
a he was Spanish but that's um
 
04:38:26.570 --> 04:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
and he certainly never came to the
 
04:38:28.250 --> 04:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
United States the closest he came was
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
the Bahamas so I think um
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
so I think it's time to rename the
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day holiday and we should have
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
on that Monday in October when it is
 
04:38:41.090 --> 04:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
currently being celebrated and when
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
we've had a mid-fall holiday for many
 
04:38:46.310 --> 04:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
many years so that's uh
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's my proposal this is not
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
the first uh go around for this but I
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
think now is the time to finally pass it
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'd be happy to take any
 
04:38:56.090 --> 04:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
questions although thank you
 
04:38:58.490 --> 04:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative are there any questions
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:04.189 --> 04:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
have you considered I mean as you say
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
it's been around a few times yeah have
 
04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
you considered splitting it into two
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
parts ending the holiday
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
versus renaming the holiday uh well
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's up to you that's not what I
 
04:39:19.131 --> 04:39:19.141 align:start position:0%
personally had in mind but you know the
 
04:39:21.410 --> 04:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
committee's bill you can
 
04:39:23.449 --> 04:39:23.459 align:start position:0%
you can do what you you can do what you
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
want with it and I'll Reserve judgment
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
on in advance and whether or not I'll if
 
04:39:29.689 --> 04:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
you vote for any amended version you
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
might come I think this is a I mean I
 
04:39:34.250 --> 04:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
think this is a good bill has been
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
vetted uh through several trips to the
 
04:39:37.490 --> 04:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
legislative process and I think it's
 
04:39:39.650 --> 04:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
ready to go as is but if the committee
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
disagrees well that's that's up to you
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's your call thank you thank you
 
04:39:45.650 --> 04:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much excuse me
 
04:39:49.490 --> 04:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien please that's
 
04:39:51.970 --> 04:39:51.980 align:start position:0%
quiet all right thank you madam chair
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative uh one of my concerns
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
just to make sure but I would like to
 
04:39:59.330 --> 04:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
have it I know your answer I think but
 
04:40:02.090 --> 04:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
document it into the testimony this will
 
04:40:04.970 --> 04:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
have no effect on any existing treaty
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
which we do not have or anything else
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
like that no other move in the future by
 
04:40:13.250 --> 04:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
any of the Native American tribes
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
um I can't really
 
04:40:16.730 --> 04:40:16.740 align:start position:0%
they can't really speak for any Native
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
American tribes now or in the future
 
04:40:21.288 --> 04:40:21.298 align:start position:0%
there are some uh local people
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
local native people who are here they'll
 
04:40:25.788 --> 04:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
speak for themselves but I think even
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
they can't predict what's going to
 
04:40:29.570 --> 04:40:29.580 align:start position:0%
happen in the future so that's uh but
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is just to rename
 
04:40:33.770 --> 04:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
the holiday which is in any case
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh just like we're both Irish ancestry
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
both just like St Patrick's Day is a
 
04:40:40.250 --> 04:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
popular celebration for even people of
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
non-irish ancestry this has become a
 
04:40:45.170 --> 04:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
popular celebration even for people of
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
non-native ancestry so I'm not sure what
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
else more to say about it but
 
04:40:51.120 --> 04:40:52.910 align:start position:0%
else more to say about it but
foreign

04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:40:54.948 --> 04:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
04:41:14.930 --> 04:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Peter Petrino I
 
04:41:25.970 --> 04:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsborough 43 the town of
 
04:41:25.980 --> 04:41:27.410 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsborough 43 the town of
Milford

04:41:27.410 --> 04:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
Milford
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
I wasn't planning on testifying today
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
but after reading a tweet this morning
 
04:41:36.490 --> 04:41:36.500 align:start position:0%
that said and I quote
 
04:41:38.810 --> 04:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
Representatives saying that they don't
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
support indigenous people's day
 
04:41:43.490 --> 04:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
because it is damaging to their Italian
 
04:41:43.500 --> 04:41:45.050 align:start position:0%
because it is damaging to their Italian
heritage

04:41:45.050 --> 04:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
heritage
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what white supremacy is
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
all about
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
that was very unfortunate
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
and I have reason to believe that it was
 
04:41:56.208 --> 04:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
directed at me
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
I could not let it go unanswered
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
I think most of you would agree that
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is one of the most
 
04:42:10.128 --> 04:42:10.138 align:start position:0%
Progressive most liberal states in the
 
04:42:10.138 --> 04:42:11.270 align:start position:0%
Progressive most liberal states in the
country

04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
country
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
yet legislation for indigenous people's
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
day in Massachusetts has continued to
 
04:42:16.620 --> 04:42:18.110 align:start position:0%
day in Massachusetts has continued to
fail

04:42:18.110 --> 04:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
fail
 
04:42:18.120 --> 04:42:19.730 align:start position:0%
fail
why

04:42:19.730 --> 04:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
because the current Speaker of the House
 
04:42:27.288 --> 04:42:27.298 align:start position:0%
and the last two speakers of the house
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
are Italian-American and they have
 
04:42:34.250 --> 04:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
fiercely defended their heritage
 
04:42:36.170 --> 04:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
so how is it that Italian-American
 
04:42:37.850 --> 04:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
Heritage in Columbus Day became
 
04:42:37.860 --> 04:42:40.128 align:start position:0%
Heritage in Columbus Day became
associated

04:42:40.128 --> 04:42:40.138 align:start position:0%
associated
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
at a time when Italians were referred to
 
04:42:46.368 --> 04:42:46.378 align:start position:0%
as docked skinned whites
 
04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
who was short with large noses and
 
04:42:53.590 --> 04:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
greasy dark curly hair
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
papists garlic eaters who don't belong
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
in this country and need to go back to
 
04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.170 --> 04:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
it was President Benjamin Harrison who
 
04:43:13.250 --> 04:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
first recognized Columbus Day in 1892 as
 
04:43:14.810 --> 04:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
a way to show support for Italian
 
04:43:18.288 --> 04:43:18.298 align:start position:0%
immigrants after a mass lynching of
 
04:43:21.170 --> 04:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
Italians in New Orleans
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
the year before
 
04:43:25.970 --> 04:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
now of course times have changed and
 
04:43:29.208 --> 04:43:29.218 align:start position:0%
many no longer recognize Columbus as the
 
04:43:32.208 --> 04:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
hero he once was proclaimed
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
and you will hear
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that Columbus was Italian
 
04:43:41.050 --> 04:43:41.060 align:start position:0%
he wasn't Italian he discovered America
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:49.670 --> 04:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
all of that is immaterial to me
 
04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
let me make it perfectly clear that I do
 
04:43:54.288 --> 04:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
not care if we remove the name Columbus
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
from the day
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
what I really care about
 
04:44:01.850 --> 04:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
is not losing the long-standing
 
04:44:04.610 --> 04:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
recognition of Italian Americans on that
 
04:44:04.620 --> 04:44:06.288 align:start position:0%
recognition of Italian Americans on that
day

04:44:06.288 --> 04:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
now Colorado
 
04:44:10.250 --> 04:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
has continued the tradition of
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
recognizing Italian-American
 
04:44:15.530 --> 04:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
by changing the name Columbus Day to
 
04:44:19.010 --> 04:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
Cabrini day in honor of Mother Frances
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
who became an American citizen
 
04:44:30.050 --> 04:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
in her life's mission was to work with
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
immigrants what a tremendous honor
 
04:44:36.288 --> 04:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
in a person to admire
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
especially as we witnessed the plight of
 
04:44:42.110 --> 04:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
today's immigrants
 
04:44:42.120 --> 04:44:43.610 align:start position:0%
today's immigrants
likewise

04:44:43.610 --> 04:44:43.620 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate that we aren't Native
 
04:44:47.930 --> 04:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
Americans we already have days of
 
04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
recognition in November and in August
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to see those days
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
codified as holidays
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
now since I've been here in the house we
 
04:45:00.530 --> 04:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
legislators have been greeted with
 
04:45:02.930 --> 04:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
bagpipes on St Patrick's Day
 
04:45:05.690 --> 04:45:05.700 align:start position:0%
beautiful native dancing and again
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
bagpipes on Scottish Totten day
 
04:45:10.730 --> 04:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
Cinco de Mayo was acknowledged during
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent we have heard speeches
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
delivered in French Spanish polish
 
04:45:21.770 --> 04:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
I and other Italian Americans are no
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
less proud of our heritage
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
we should not be divisive and pit one
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
ethnic group against another
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is no hope for Humanity if we do
 
04:45:38.930 --> 04:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
not recognize support and celebrate our
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
common Humanity
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening to my
 
04:45:45.050 --> 04:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'd be happy to take any
 
04:45:45.060 --> 04:45:49.910 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'd be happy to take any
questions

04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
04:45:54.650 --> 04:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
04:45:56.350 --> 04:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to go back into your
 
04:45:58.850 --> 04:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
Italian-American you know linear chair
 
04:46:00.890 --> 04:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
but have you ever heard of the term
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
cyclone benzetti and if you have not
 
04:46:07.310 --> 04:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's fair but I do urge members of the
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee to look up that particular
 
04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts case it may have some
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
additional information to them on it but
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you ever heard of those two
 
04:46:18.350 --> 04:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
gentlemen yes I have I was born and
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
raised in the North End of Boston
 
04:46:22.128 --> 04:46:22.138 align:start position:0%
Boston's Little Italy I still have
 
04:46:23.868 --> 04:46:23.878 align:start position:0%
family that lives down there I'm very
 
04:46:26.090 --> 04:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
proud of my Heritage the North End of
 
04:46:29.410 --> 04:46:29.420 align:start position:0%
Boston was the home of the Saco and
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
venzetti defense committee and it was
 
04:46:34.190 --> 04:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
from there on Hannibal Street at
 
04:46:36.590 --> 04:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
langone's funeral home where they had
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
their their funeral
 
04:46:39.120 --> 04:46:41.690 align:start position:0%
their their funeral
foreign

04:46:41.690 --> 04:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:46.730 --> 04:46:46.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you more into it ties
 
04:46:49.788 --> 04:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
into Columbus Day I see I was led to
 
04:46:52.128 --> 04:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
believe that that may have been one of
 
04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
the appeasements they were executed
 
04:46:58.128 --> 04:46:58.138 align:start position:0%
wrongfully so they received pardons from
 
04:47:00.530 --> 04:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts governor but in
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
relation to uh Columbus Day that's
 
04:47:05.330 --> 04:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
correct and when the bigots
 
04:47:08.288 --> 04:47:08.298 align:start position:0%
um called insult to Italian Americans
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
Italians always were able to say you
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
know uh if it wasn't for an Italian
 
04:47:16.368 --> 04:47:16.378 align:start position:0%
um this country would not have been
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
discovered and you wouldn't be here
 
04:47:20.708 --> 04:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
today I mean that was always the retort
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
when faced with that kind of
 
04:47:25.390 --> 04:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination now again I understand
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
that times have changed and we no longer
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
look at Columbus as the hero we once did
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
but a hundred years ago 50 years ago 20
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
years ago when I was a boy he was looked
 
04:47:39.050 --> 04:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
upon as a hero and Italians always said
 
04:47:41.868 --> 04:47:41.878 align:start position:0%
hey look if it wasn't for one of our own
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
this country wouldn't be here and you
 
04:47:46.010 --> 04:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
bigots who was saying we don't belong
 
04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
well listen you wouldn't be here if it
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:57.410 --> 04:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
04:47:59.390 --> 04:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:59.400 --> 04:48:00.708 align:start position:0%
thank you

representative leckis will take over and
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:11.100 --> 04:48:20.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:48:20.770 --> 04:48:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Catherine
 
04:48:27.230 --> 04:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
sofikidis this is my fourth term as a
 
04:48:29.208 --> 04:48:29.218 align:start position:0%
legislator I'm from Nashville award
 
04:48:32.810 --> 04:48:32.820 align:start position:0%
seven which is called Crown Hill if you
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
are familiar with that area of Nashua I
 
04:48:38.690 --> 04:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
am here today to talk
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh in support of House Bill 180 which is
 
04:48:45.470 --> 04:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
probably no surprise to anybody here I
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
was born in the territory of Alaska
 
04:48:50.690 --> 04:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
before statehood
 
04:48:54.770 --> 04:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
I I want to be brutally brutally Frank
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
with all of you here
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
there is not one person of color on this
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
committee not one
 
04:49:04.690 --> 04:49:04.700 align:start position:0%
and racism
 
04:49:09.530 --> 04:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
matters and I want to give you some
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
terms that I want you to look up because
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
the last time around with this I heard
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
so much ridiculous things out of this
 
04:49:16.920 --> 04:49:17.930 align:start position:0%
so much ridiculous things out of this
committee

04:49:17.930 --> 04:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:49:20.448 --> 04:49:20.458 align:start position:0%
so the first word I want you to look up
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
is to decolonialize now I realize that
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
we are right here
 
04:49:29.810 --> 04:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
in the heart of colonial America
 
04:49:29.820 --> 04:49:31.128 align:start position:0%
in the heart of colonial America
but

04:49:31.128 --> 04:49:31.138 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:49:34.510 --> 04:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
understands what you the colonialists
 
04:49:39.410 --> 04:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
have done
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
and the colonialist came and now you say
 
04:49:46.490 --> 04:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
because we're here that the country
 
04:49:46.500 --> 04:49:47.690 align:start position:0%
because we're here that the country
started

04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
started
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
well nothing could be further from the
 
04:49:49.920 --> 04:49:50.810 align:start position:0%
well nothing could be further from the
truth

04:49:50.810 --> 04:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
truth
 
04:49:54.590 --> 04:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
the people were already here they were
 
04:49:57.890 --> 04:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
here they were living wonderful lives
 
04:50:01.610 --> 04:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
and why don't you see Indians here
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
Indians because Columbus thought he
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
found Indians because he found a way
 
04:50:10.730 --> 04:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
to the Silk Road he didn't they're not
 
04:50:14.208 --> 04:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
indians they're Native Americans and
 
04:50:17.090 --> 04:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
my oldest brother who's adopted is a
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
clinket Indian
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
I grew up among indigenous people in
 
04:50:25.250 --> 04:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
Alaska and furthermore in Guam where my
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
father was the United States Attorney
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
for President Nixon
 
04:50:32.510 --> 04:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
I grew up a white minority and I'm
 
04:50:35.448 --> 04:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
totally totally comfortable with it
 
04:50:35.458 --> 04:50:36.770 align:start position:0%
totally totally comfortable with it
so

04:50:36.770 --> 04:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
I married I married a Greek
 
04:50:42.530 --> 04:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
when I was 20.
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
the most ethnic Greek you could ever
 
04:50:47.810 --> 04:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
imagine and it wasn't American citizen
 
04:50:51.650 --> 04:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
until after we were married but
 
04:50:51.660 --> 04:50:52.910 align:start position:0%
until after we were married but
um

04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a way for all of this
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
ethnic people to understand that the
 
04:51:02.930 --> 04:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
humanity of the world demands that
 
04:51:02.940 --> 04:51:05.208 align:start position:0%
humanity of the world demands that
reconciliation

04:51:05.208 --> 04:51:05.218 align:start position:0%
reconciliation
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
with our history needs to happen
 
04:51:12.050 --> 04:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
and even our brothers and sisters to the
 
04:51:14.930 --> 04:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
North in Canada who are wrestling with
 
04:51:17.288 --> 04:51:17.298 align:start position:0%
this same issue have understand
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
understood in the last few years and
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
they have Country-Wide past
 
04:51:27.770 --> 04:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
reconciliation now why why I heard
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
questions about why does it have to be a
 
04:51:31.490 --> 04:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
state law
 
04:51:31.500 --> 04:51:32.810 align:start position:0%
state law
because

04:51:32.810 --> 04:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:51:36.170 --> 04:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
people come to the the State House
 
04:51:40.550 --> 04:51:40.560 align:start position:0%

04:51:56.330 --> 04:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
the residential school program the
 
04:51:58.128 --> 04:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
residential school program where the
 
04:52:00.050 --> 04:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
children were taken away from their
 
04:52:03.170 --> 04:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
families so that they could break the
 
04:52:05.810 --> 04:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
culture of the indigenous people
 
04:52:09.110 --> 04:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they have committed atrocities that
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
went over hundreds of years I want you
 
04:52:15.770 --> 04:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
to look up the Wounded Knee Massacre I
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
want you to look up the Sand River
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
Massacre and I want you to know that we
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
have just passed a huge Memorial to the
 
04:52:26.570 --> 04:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
Wounded Knee Massacre where children
 
04:52:28.368 --> 04:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
young adults
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
take their horses the last week of
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
December and they ride
 
04:52:37.010 --> 04:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
from Standing Rock reservation
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
to the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre
 
04:52:43.128 --> 04:52:43.138 align:start position:0%
every year the last week of December and
 
04:52:44.990 --> 04:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
if you can imagine what that weather is
 
04:52:47.090 --> 04:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
like now why is it important here for
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because this is where it
 
04:52:50.700 --> 04:52:52.250 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because this is where it
started

04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
started
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
we need to understand that there was
 
04:52:59.890 --> 04:52:59.900 align:start position:0%
people there was a
 
04:53:04.010 --> 04:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
civilization a rich Dynamic civilization
 
04:53:06.610 --> 04:53:06.620 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
04:53:06.620 --> 04:53:08.570 align:start position:0%
in this state
before

04:53:08.570 --> 04:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:53:08.580 --> 04:53:10.788 align:start position:0%
before
colonization

04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
colonization
 
04:53:16.850 --> 04:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
and we are taught Lies We are taught
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
so many things that are not true about
 
04:53:23.448 --> 04:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
the past of this country and it is time
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
it is time the internet has been a great
 
04:53:31.970 --> 04:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
equalizer and we can understand
 
04:53:34.850 --> 04:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
that we all have to live together and
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
part of that living together is to
 
04:53:38.280 --> 04:53:40.310 align:start position:0%
part of that living together is to
reconcile

04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
reconcile
 
04:53:43.850 --> 04:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
and to understand and we cannot do that
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
without legislation and so I am not
 
04:53:52.128 --> 04:53:52.138 align:start position:0%
saying anything about any
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
ethnic group I'm about as ethnic Greek
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%

04:53:59.770 --> 04:53:59.780 align:start position:0%
so I love
 
04:54:03.770 --> 04:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
ethnicity I love it but that ethnicity
 
04:54:06.288 --> 04:54:06.298 align:start position:0%
also includes our indigenous people
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%

hi hello everyone my name is Fawn Cadet
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:08.750 --> 04:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Fon Cadet and I live in New
 
04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a descendant of a proud
 
04:55:12.170 --> 04:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
of the Senate of the blackfeet nation
 
04:55:15.530 --> 04:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's in Montana I am someone that has
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
grown up in New Hampshire but also has
 
04:55:20.208 --> 04:55:20.218 align:start position:0%
lived on a reservation it wasn't mine we
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have a dormitory there when I
 
04:55:23.208 --> 04:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to college so I found one
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
on the Navajo res
 
04:55:26.930 --> 04:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
so while being a descendant of the
 
04:55:29.650 --> 04:55:29.660 align:start position:0%
blackfeet nation and mixed tribes I also
 
04:55:32.150 --> 04:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
very clearly mixed so I also got the
 
04:55:34.010 --> 04:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
experience like Catherine of being the
 
04:55:36.288 --> 04:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
minority amongst many full-blood Natives
 
04:55:38.810 --> 04:55:38.820 align:start position:0%
and it was a wonderful experience and in
 
04:55:40.610 --> 04:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
my family I'm
 
04:55:44.810 --> 04:55:44.820 align:start position:0%
um also have being a bit more mixed that
 
04:55:47.810 --> 04:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
experience so I've I've been able to un
 
04:55:50.208 --> 04:55:50.218 align:start position:0%
you know relate and live through many
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
things and have that experience with my
 
04:55:55.368 --> 04:55:55.378 align:start position:0%
family and people on a reservations many
 
04:55:57.050 --> 04:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
reservations my family I have family on
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
many reservations different different
 
04:56:03.410 --> 04:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
tribes so I can I can speak to what the
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
effect of white supremacy can be in many
 
04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
Avenues having experienced you know
 
04:56:13.010 --> 04:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
different aspects of it why I feel like
 
04:56:14.570 --> 04:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm requesting Columbus Day to be
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
changed indigenous peoples in New
 
04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the strong pride in
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
my ancestry when I grew up here as a
 
04:56:22.250 --> 04:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
child I was keenly aware of the
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
injustices committed to Native Americans
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
and then having lived on a reservation
 
04:56:29.150 --> 04:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
and through my family absolutely aware
 
04:56:32.750 --> 04:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
of racism hardships I have family
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
members that were in residential schools
 
04:56:36.650 --> 04:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
I have family members that have lived in
 
04:56:38.570 --> 04:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
reservations I've lived on a reservation
 
04:56:38.580 --> 04:56:40.010 align:start position:0%
reservations I've lived on a reservation
and

04:56:40.010 --> 04:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
some people don't even have running
 
04:56:44.750 --> 04:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
water still electricity and that is a
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
way of life for people
 
04:56:49.610 --> 04:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
but there's many people still have
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
overcome these hardships to thrive
 
04:56:56.570 --> 04:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
but this is what's important I am keenly
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
aware of the injustices committed
 
04:57:00.410 --> 04:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
against Native Americans this being our
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
nation first this nation was already
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
inhabited with indigenous peoples and we
 
04:57:07.788 --> 04:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
are still here
 
04:57:11.510 --> 04:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
this land this this right here was is
 
04:57:14.208 --> 04:57:14.218 align:start position:0%
native land I'm not saying was it still
 
04:57:16.570 --> 04:57:16.580 align:start position:0%
is because we never succeeded this land
 
04:57:18.590 --> 04:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
at all
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:24.830 --> 04:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
so before Columbus era there were
 
04:57:26.990 --> 04:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
millions of indigenous peoples in North
 
04:57:28.730 --> 04:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
America Central America and South
 
04:57:31.010 --> 04:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
America the wabanaki known as the people
 
04:57:32.930 --> 04:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
of the Dawn lived in New Hampshire long
 
04:57:35.448 --> 04:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
before the colonists survived indigenous
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
peoples here thrived in harmony with
 
04:57:40.670 --> 04:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
gadakana which means world for wabanaki
 
04:57:42.770 --> 04:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
their culture was rich with tradition
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
honor and respect for the people land
 
04:57:46.550 --> 04:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
and Wildlife
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
I want to say that the Kawasaki band of
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Penacook Abenaki are the local
 
04:57:53.570 --> 04:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
people in this area who also support the
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
change and have worked for years to help
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
make this happen
 
04:58:01.550 --> 04:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
for me Columbus Day is not a day of joy
 
04:58:03.530 --> 04:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
it is a day of mourning and I should say
 
04:58:05.810 --> 04:58:05.820 align:start position:0%
nationally to indigenous peoples it is a
 
04:58:08.690 --> 04:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
day of mourning
 
04:58:11.330 --> 04:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
during this period terrorism occurred to
 
04:58:13.070 --> 04:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples they were massacred
 
04:58:14.990 --> 04:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
rape enslaved tortured and genocide
 
04:58:17.570 --> 04:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
occurred now I've read many things that
 
04:58:20.090 --> 04:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
said up to 124 million in indigenous
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
peoples were here before this era
 
04:58:24.890 --> 04:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
occurred I've also read it's down to 120
 
04:58:27.470 --> 04:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
million but after that period when all
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
this occurred it went down to as low as
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
6 million indigenous peoples there are
 
04:58:32.990 --> 04:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
some tribes that they're not even sure
 
04:58:34.910 --> 04:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
exists now
 
04:58:39.288 --> 04:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.208 --> 04:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
changing this holiday to indigenous
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
people say offers honor and respect to
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
our people
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
as Columbus say this only marks a false
 
04:58:48.770 --> 04:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
representation of what happened to the
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
past and that is white supremacy if we
 
04:58:52.970 --> 04:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
do not teach the truth of what happened
 
04:58:56.750 --> 04:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
we are allowing this awful awful
 
04:58:58.670 --> 04:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible things that happen
 
04:59:00.650 --> 04:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
that could be repeated again you have to
 
04:59:03.050 --> 04:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
teach the truth so you do not repeat it
 
04:59:05.390 --> 04:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
we have to teach children we have to
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
teach our society to tell the truth to
 
04:59:10.730 --> 04:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
honor and respect people by changing the
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%

04:59:37.430 --> 04:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
this is a national movement that has
 
04:59:40.490 --> 04:59:40.500 align:start position:0%

04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
might be 22 towns yep 22 towns and
 
04:59:54.410 --> 04:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities that celebrate it we just
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
recently got Plymouth it's moving
 
04:59:56.280 --> 04:59:58.250 align:start position:0%
recently got Plymouth it's moving
forward

04:59:58.250 --> 04:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:00:00.708 --> 05:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
um schools are adopting it colleges are
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
adopting it so I really hope that this
 
05:00:05.448 --> 05:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
is the time that we can make this happen
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:00:09.128 --> 05:00:09.138 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:18.650 --> 05:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:00:20.470 --> 05:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:00:24.410 --> 05:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
seems like maybe you are speaking from a
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
written document
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
yes which I pretty much have memorized
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
I've I've done this a while uh could you
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
possibly provide that to the committee
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
do you have it
 
05:00:36.590 --> 05:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
also I sent it to you via email and
 
05:00:38.930 --> 05:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
there was some glitch via the emails as
 
05:00:40.850 --> 05:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
05:00:42.288 --> 05:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
one of our emails got bounced back so
 
05:00:47.930 --> 05:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
I hope that can be worked out thank you
 
05:00:51.830 --> 05:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time thank you so much
 
05:01:09.590 --> 05:01:09.600 align:start position:0%

testimony I live um here uh nearby in
 
05:01:23.150 --> 05:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
Suncook which is on unseated uh
 
05:01:27.530 --> 05:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
territory of the Abenaki people
 
05:01:27.540 --> 05:01:28.128 align:start position:0%
territory of the Abenaki people
um

05:01:28.128 --> 05:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:32.030 --> 05:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to speak about how uh I
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
don't believe that
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
Columbus was a hero I'm a I'm a retired
 
05:01:42.250 --> 05:01:42.260 align:start position:0%
teacher I spent a lot of time seeing how
 
05:01:45.288 --> 05:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
uh these kind of holidays are are taught
 
05:01:46.610 --> 05:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
in schools
 
05:01:49.850 --> 05:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and usually it's it's some kind of
 
05:01:52.730 --> 05:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
mythoh heroic kind of idea that's put
 
05:01:52.740 --> 05:01:54.050 align:start position:0%
mythoh heroic kind of idea that's put
forth

05:01:54.050 --> 05:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
forth
 
05:01:57.470 --> 05:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I feel that Columbus himself was
 
05:02:00.050 --> 05:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
um a brutal person
 
05:02:00.060 --> 05:02:00.670 align:start position:0%
um a brutal person
um

05:02:00.670 --> 05:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh the um
 
05:02:05.150 --> 05:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
and they're so there there are a number
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
of reasons I want to and I'm going to
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
focus mostly on what I've learned about
 
05:02:09.600 --> 05:02:11.208 align:start position:0%
focus mostly on what I've learned about
Columbus

05:02:11.208 --> 05:02:11.218 align:start position:0%
Columbus
 
05:02:11.218 --> 05:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
Columbus
um

05:02:11.990 --> 05:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:15.288 --> 05:02:15.298 align:start position:0%
and uh first of all he didn't really
 
05:02:17.810 --> 05:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
discover America
 
05:02:19.850 --> 05:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
um he never set foot on what we consider
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
North America at all
 
05:02:24.948 --> 05:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
he spent his time in the Caribbean he
 
05:02:26.448 --> 05:02:26.458 align:start position:0%
spent a little bit of time in South
 
05:02:30.050 --> 05:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
America never set foot on
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
um North America
 
05:02:36.110 --> 05:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.530 --> 05:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
and in his own journals Columbus recites
 
05:02:42.230 --> 05:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
how an easily Native Americans native
 
05:02:44.510 --> 05:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
people could be enslaved and exploited
 
05:02:47.810 --> 05:02:47.820 align:start position:0%
and he quickly proceeded to do so
 
05:02:51.050 --> 05:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I found that
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
really troubled me was the amount of uh
 
05:02:58.490 --> 05:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
in enslavement that he uh
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
put forth um
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
I'll start with some of this some of the
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
the brutality that he's um known for
 
05:03:13.798 --> 05:03:17.390 align:start position:0%
the brutality that he's um known for
um

05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
see so
 
05:03:21.770 --> 05:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at some notes here if I'm
 
05:03:24.170 --> 05:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
not trying to read them all
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
05:03:29.090 --> 05:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
there's just a few a few little stories
 
05:03:31.610 --> 05:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
here that uh that
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
that really stuck stuck out at me
 
05:03:35.040 --> 05:03:35.868 align:start position:0%
that really stuck stuck out at me
um

05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:35.878 --> 05:03:37.610 align:start position:0%
um
that

05:03:37.610 --> 05:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh he uh
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
at one point
 
05:03:45.530 --> 05:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
um on Saint Croix I come spread
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
um according to his own count kept an
 
05:03:49.128 --> 05:03:49.138 align:start position:0%
indigenous woman he captured whom
 
05:03:52.430 --> 05:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
Columbus quote gave to him then brutally
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
raped her
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
another uh instance of his brutality the
 
05:04:00.530 --> 05:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
punishment for an indigenous person
 
05:04:05.330 --> 05:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
who was age 14 or older failing to pay a
 
05:04:08.570 --> 05:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
hawks Bell or casabella
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
worth of gold dust every six months was
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
cutting off the hands of those without
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
tokens often leading them to bleed to
 
05:04:18.240 --> 05:04:20.690 align:start position:0%
tokens often leading them to bleed to
death

05:04:20.690 --> 05:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:20.700 --> 05:04:21.288 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:04:21.288 --> 05:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
so this and there's numerous stories of
 
05:04:27.890 --> 05:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
his dismemberment practices
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
um this which apparently was one of the
 
05:04:31.788 --> 05:04:31.798 align:start position:0%
things that he thought was a way to
 
05:04:34.490 --> 05:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
control the population
 
05:04:34.500 --> 05:04:35.628 align:start position:0%
control the population
um

05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:35.638 --> 05:04:37.310 align:start position:0%
um
and

05:04:37.310 --> 05:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:40.490 --> 05:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because the uh doctrine
 
05:04:44.208 --> 05:04:44.218 align:start position:0%
of Discovery was put forth to
 
05:04:44.218 --> 05:04:44.990 align:start position:0%
of Discovery was put forth to
um

05:04:44.990 --> 05:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
allow that the enslavement of
 
05:04:48.000 --> 05:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
allow that the enslavement of
non-christians

05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
non-christians
 
05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
and so he had an economic interest in
 
05:04:55.850 --> 05:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
enslavement of this these uh natives
 
05:04:58.610 --> 05:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
that he met and so he was not eager to
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
baptize them
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
so this he Not only was not really doing
 
05:05:07.128 --> 05:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
the purpose of of uh christianizing the
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
lands but he was actually
 
05:05:14.330 --> 05:05:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:18.650 --> 05:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
and at one point he was recalled as
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
Governor by
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
because of the brutality of his regime
 
05:05:30.230 --> 05:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
that they're not particularly nice
 
05:05:32.448 --> 05:05:32.458 align:start position:0%
people themselves
 
05:05:34.368 --> 05:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
yet here they are calling this person
 
05:05:36.890 --> 05:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
too brutal to govern
 
05:05:36.900 --> 05:05:38.270 align:start position:0%
too brutal to govern
um

05:05:38.270 --> 05:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:41.868 --> 05:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
so that this um
 
05:05:45.050 --> 05:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
there's a really interesting uh example
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
of the enslavement that he did he one
 
05:05:50.930 --> 05:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
point he rounded up about 1500 of the
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
the airlocks who are the native people
 
05:05:53.580 --> 05:05:55.250 align:start position:0%
the airlocks who are the native people
and

05:05:55.250 --> 05:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:55.260 --> 05:05:56.330 align:start position:0%
and
um

05:05:56.330 --> 05:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:59.810 --> 05:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
and they and about 500 of the strongest
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
were shipped to Spain as slaves
 
05:06:04.730 --> 05:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
and about 200 of those who died in route
 
05:06:07.010 --> 05:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
so there was a constant
 
05:06:07.020 --> 05:06:07.730 align:start position:0%
so there was a constant
um

05:06:07.730 --> 05:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:13.310 --> 05:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
death as well as enslavement in his um
 
05:06:15.788 --> 05:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
and at one point
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
he was reported that he punished a man
 
05:06:21.050 --> 05:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
found guilty of stealing corn
 
05:06:23.868 --> 05:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
by having his ears and nose cut off
 
05:06:26.050 --> 05:06:26.060 align:start position:0%
and then selling them
 
05:06:28.730 --> 05:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
are you reading your testimony which you
 
05:06:30.170 --> 05:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
provided to us
 
05:06:32.090 --> 05:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry are you reading the testimony
 
05:06:34.010 --> 05:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
that you provided to us if so if you
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
could just summarize oh hi I'm
 
05:06:38.270 --> 05:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
surprising it I am summarizing I just
 
05:06:41.930 --> 05:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
noticed you indicated some examples this
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
these are this is a lot more involved
 
05:06:45.120 --> 05:06:45.948 align:start position:0%
these are this is a lot more involved
here

05:06:45.948 --> 05:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
05:06:48.600 --> 05:06:50.448 align:start position:0%
um so uh
uh

05:06:50.448 --> 05:06:50.458 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to point out that that
 
05:06:56.448 --> 05:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
I'll summarize it this way
 
05:06:58.970 --> 05:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
either he was a brutal man
 
05:07:00.708 --> 05:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
who was not a hero
 
05:07:03.730 --> 05:07:03.740 align:start position:0%
and and as a teacher I can't imagine
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
teaching the truth about him
 
05:07:09.050 --> 05:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh so that this is the part that
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
troubles me there's no heroic part that
 
05:07:15.410 --> 05:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
of this story that can be taught to kids
 
05:07:17.570 --> 05:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and so it should be
 
05:07:19.610 --> 05:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
he should be
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
um relegated to the minor part of
 
05:07:25.970 --> 05:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
history of that he really played and and
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
let's I and I'll yield to the indigenous
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
people here to explain why indigenous
 
05:07:33.590 --> 05:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
people day is much greater use of our
 
05:07:35.150 --> 05:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
educational time
 
05:07:38.208 --> 05:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.770 --> 05:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
um does anyone have I don't know if
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
you'll take questions does anyone have
 
05:07:44.990 --> 05:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:47.448 --> 05:07:47.458 align:start position:0%
you've seen none thank you you're going
 
05:07:48.830 --> 05:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
to provide the original
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
um have you provided that you've passed
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna have a problem reading
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%

when I I can't read what was what was
 
05:08:07.550 --> 05:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
that when
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
point oh Fuentes okay thank you thank
 
05:08:14.208 --> 05:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:15.830 --> 05:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:08:17.208 --> 05:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for allowing me
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
to speak to you today uh indigenous
 
05:08:21.230 --> 05:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
people today and its recognition will
 
05:08:24.590 --> 05:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
help correct uh a white wash notion that
 
05:08:26.510 --> 05:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
Christopher Columbus was Italian uh
 
05:08:28.128 --> 05:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
let's be honest you know the Republic of
 
05:08:30.590 --> 05:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
Italy was informed then he came from he
 
05:08:32.090 --> 05:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
traveled the Seas from the Republic of
 
05:08:36.050 --> 05:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh Genoa so I'm here to recognize that
 
05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
the contributions of indigenous people
 
05:08:39.890 --> 05:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh to this nation
 
05:08:42.050 --> 05:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
you know but also to speak about the
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
need to recognize to recognize the
 
05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
existence of indigenous peoples all
 
05:08:49.250 --> 05:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
around the Americas uh 54 million people
 
05:08:51.708 --> 05:08:51.718 align:start position:0%
live currently to this day in North
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
Central and South America uh I'm on for
 
05:08:55.788 --> 05:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that representative
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
Petrino left because I was the one that
 
05:08:59.330 --> 05:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
made that tweet this morning uh and
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
definitely was indirected to him uh it
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
was directly mostly to other
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
representatives to make the comment that
 
05:09:05.930 --> 05:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
they couldn't support indigenous people
 
05:09:07.850 --> 05:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
they because they were members of the
 
05:09:09.530 --> 05:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
Knights of Columbus so that was going to
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
be offenses to them so that's the reason
 
05:09:14.030 --> 05:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
why I posted that tweet so he felt there
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
was an attack doing my apologies but it
 
05:09:17.628 --> 05:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't directed to him as well so uh you
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%

issue that crosses borders borders that
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
were created by
 
05:10:27.650 --> 05:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
after the fact because the Indians

indigenous people's day is already

municipality that we are currently

sitting in acknowledges indigenous

people's day a decision that followed a
 
05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
long line of other communities that had
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
already made this switch to honoring the
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
people who lived on this land for
 
05:12:37.730 --> 05:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
centuries before colonization took place
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
sending HB 180 to the full legislature

with a recommendation of ought to pass
 
05:12:44.750 --> 05:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be a step in the right direction

05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
rehash it again you have a written
 
05:15:20.280 --> 05:15:21.410 align:start position:0%
rehash it again you have a written
testimony

05:15:21.410 --> 05:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
we we saw this as a Grassroots movement
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
initially because various religious
 
05:15:27.120 --> 05:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
initially because various religious
groups

05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
groups
 
05:15:30.890 --> 05:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
were trying to uh to deal with papal
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
decrees of the age of Discovery
 
05:15:36.050 --> 05:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
especially in the 1400s
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of these papal Bulls became the
 
05:15:42.170 --> 05:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
basis for taking land away from
 
05:15:44.208 --> 05:15:44.218 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples in the new world as
 
05:15:46.730 --> 05:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
they said to divide it up between the
 
05:15:50.030 --> 05:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
princes and and princesses of
 
05:15:52.190 --> 05:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
Christianity as they were fighting
 
05:15:55.010 --> 05:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
between the Royals of Europe
 
05:15:55.020 --> 05:15:57.050 align:start position:0%
between the Royals of Europe
unfortunately

05:15:57.050 --> 05:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
um a lot of harm was done these papal
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
bulls actually became the basis for a
 
05:16:05.810 --> 05:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
lot of our federal laws which Justified
 
05:16:08.690 --> 05:16:08.700 align:start position:0%
taking land especially in the 18 early
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
1800s when the Supreme Court in Jackson
 
05:16:15.650 --> 05:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
and others argued about these issues and
 
05:16:18.170 --> 05:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
eventually it it resulted in the
 
05:16:20.510 --> 05:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
codification that it was righteous and
 
05:16:23.390 --> 05:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
just as Christians to take the land away
 
05:16:25.850 --> 05:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
from indigenous people after all we were
 
05:16:28.250 --> 05:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
not civilized or considered part of
 
05:16:28.260 --> 05:16:29.570 align:start position:0%
not civilized or considered part of
humanity

05:16:29.570 --> 05:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's so much to be said about
 
05:16:31.080 --> 05:16:33.230 align:start position:0%
there's so much to be said about
Columbus

05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
Columbus
 
05:16:35.050 --> 05:16:35.060 align:start position:0%
he was a genoan
 
05:16:37.910 --> 05:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
Italy wasn't actually a country until
 
05:16:37.920 --> 05:16:39.708 align:start position:0%
Italy wasn't actually a country until
1861.

05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
1861.
 
05:16:42.170 --> 05:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
he may have been a mercenary he was
 
05:16:43.850 --> 05:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
definitely a slaver by the time he
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
figured out that there was great
 
05:16:48.650 --> 05:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and slavery because there
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
really was no gold in the Caribbean of
 
05:16:53.270 --> 05:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
any value the Royals were always looking
 
05:16:55.010 --> 05:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
for gold and silver as part of their
 
05:16:55.020 --> 05:16:56.330 align:start position:0%
for gold and silver as part of their
Treasury

05:16:56.330 --> 05:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
Treasury
 
05:16:58.490 --> 05:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
to finance some of the stuff that
 
05:17:00.770 --> 05:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
Columbus did
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
they took the land from the Jewish
 
05:17:04.368 --> 05:17:04.378 align:start position:0%
communities just like they did from the
 
05:17:06.410 --> 05:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
Moors you know the Muslim communities of
 
05:17:08.810 --> 05:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
Europe took their lands and their
 
05:17:11.930 --> 05:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
property to fund all the exploration for
 
05:17:13.310 --> 05:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
the Christian world
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
so there was an intersection of cultures
 
05:17:17.868 --> 05:17:17.878 align:start position:0%
it was not just indigenous peoples of
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
America that were impacted their other
 
05:17:22.670 --> 05:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
religious face of Europe that were
 
05:17:25.128 --> 05:17:25.138 align:start position:0%
impacted very severely by these kings
 
05:17:26.570 --> 05:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
and queens
 
05:17:29.448 --> 05:17:29.458 align:start position:0%
is without any doubt that he started the
 
05:17:32.030 --> 05:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
global Atlantic slave trade it's well
 
05:17:34.368 --> 05:17:34.378 align:start position:0%
documented his atrocities are well
 
05:17:36.970 --> 05:17:36.980 align:start position:0%
documented his amusements with
 
05:17:39.470 --> 05:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
brutalizing people were well documented
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
and he never really did find North
 
05:17:41.760 --> 05:17:43.010 align:start position:0%
and he never really did find North
America

05:17:43.010 --> 05:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
America
 
05:17:45.470 --> 05:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
I'm 75 years old and I was brought up in
 
05:17:47.570 --> 05:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
a school system where all we sang was in
 
05:17:50.510 --> 05:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue and
 
05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
he discovered America
 
05:17:54.410 --> 05:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
it was a lie let's be honest about it it
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
was a lie in the beginning and it's
 
05:17:57.770 --> 05:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
still perpetuated
 
05:17:59.570 --> 05:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
we've always been trying to re-educate
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we're not saying we're changing
 
05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
history we're not woke we're not trying
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
to revise history we just want everybody
 
05:18:07.250 --> 05:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
to know there's another deep rich
 
05:18:10.128 --> 05:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
inherited history that we have to come
 
05:18:12.708 --> 05:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge We inherited this history
 
05:18:15.170 --> 05:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
we don't have to apologize for it we
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
know that things weren't right we know
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
things that the papal decrees created
 
05:18:20.690 --> 05:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
were not right
 
05:18:23.208 --> 05:18:23.218 align:start position:0%
religious groups Many religious
 
05:18:24.890 --> 05:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
religious groups were the first people
 
05:18:27.650 --> 05:18:27.660 align:start position:0%
that worked with us to re
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
introduce the idea of indigenous
 
05:18:31.550 --> 05:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
people's day and some of the church
 
05:18:33.770 --> 05:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
groups that we work with wrote letters
 
05:18:35.810 --> 05:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
to the pope saying that the papal Bulls
 
05:18:38.868 --> 05:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
the 1400s have to be rescinded and
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
another papal statement come from
 
05:18:43.128 --> 05:18:43.138 align:start position:0%
Vatican saying we repudiate the actions
 
05:18:45.530 --> 05:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
of those popes in the past it hasn't
 
05:18:48.530 --> 05:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
come to be so everything is now more or
 
05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
less a Grassroots movement things have
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
been codified in federal law that
 
05:18:56.030 --> 05:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
granted the use in stealing of land and
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
New England was the epicent of it let's
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
be candid this is where it all started
 
05:19:03.410 --> 05:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
and it spread Westward from here
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
the abnacky Penacook in particular which
 
05:19:08.448 --> 05:19:08.458 align:start position:0%
were occupying this whole Merrimack
 
05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
River Valley system and a pescata as
 
05:19:10.560 --> 05:19:11.330 align:start position:0%
River Valley system and a pescata as
well

05:19:11.330 --> 05:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:19:13.430 --> 05:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
have been here for thousands of years
 
05:19:16.610 --> 05:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
our latest estimate is maybe as far back
 
05:19:20.330 --> 05:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
as it's we know eight uh 12 800 years
 
05:19:22.850 --> 05:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
and maybe 13 000 years so there are
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
people here well entrenched living here
 
05:19:28.368 --> 05:19:28.378 align:start position:0%
living off the land and we'd like you to
 
05:19:30.170 --> 05:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
recognize that fact
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
we realize also that there was a lot of
 
05:19:34.430 --> 05:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
dissension about the dates we heard
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
several dates were recognized indigenous
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
people this day none of them really have
 
05:19:41.930 --> 05:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
taken hold anywhere in the country you
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
know we hear about October dates
 
05:19:45.830 --> 05:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
November dates not one of you could
 
05:19:48.288 --> 05:19:48.298 align:start position:0%
actually tell me that date we then heard
 
05:19:49.970 --> 05:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
people say well why don't we just use
 
05:19:52.730 --> 05:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
the un's indigenous people's day when
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
they did all of the recognition of
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
indigenous peoples in the world
 
05:20:00.288 --> 05:20:00.298 align:start position:0%
what countries oppose that the original
 
05:20:04.610 --> 05:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
uh UK the original uh territories of the
 
05:20:06.170 --> 05:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
United Kingdom
 
05:20:08.810 --> 05:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
Canada Australia New Zealand and United
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
States all opposed indigenous peoples
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
rights initiatives that were initiated
 
05:20:17.930 --> 05:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
by the U.N a date was established as our
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
October August 9th is indigenous
 
05:20:22.868 --> 05:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
people's day but that does not satisfy
 
05:20:25.670 --> 05:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
the needs of the indigenous communities
 
05:20:28.730 --> 05:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
here in the Americas that is a worldwide
 
05:20:28.740 --> 05:20:30.288 align:start position:0%
here in the Americas that is a worldwide
statement

05:20:30.288 --> 05:20:30.298 align:start position:0%
statement
 
05:20:32.930 --> 05:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
in this country reach Administration has
 
05:20:35.330 --> 05:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
fought against recognizing any U.N
 
05:20:35.340 --> 05:20:36.590 align:start position:0%
fought against recognizing any U.N
resolutions

05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
05:20:38.208 --> 05:20:38.218 align:start position:0%
starting with the Bush Administration
 
05:20:40.610 --> 05:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
and it goes back and forth I think Obama
 
05:20:42.890 --> 05:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
tried to get it recognized he tried to
 
05:20:44.330 --> 05:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
get indigenous people to stay you know
 
05:20:46.550 --> 05:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
Clinton did as well they did
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
proclamations it's never taken hold
 
05:20:52.670 --> 05:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
so when not to disparage all the
 
05:20:55.788 --> 05:20:55.798 align:start position:0%
immigrants and I mean everybody thinks
 
05:20:57.890 --> 05:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
the I you know first of all we had
 
05:20:59.990 --> 05:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
Scotch French and English as first
 
05:21:03.350 --> 05:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
immigrants here and then we had
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
um Irish we then we had uh polish and
 
05:21:09.770 --> 05:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
and and God knows how many other ethnic
 
05:21:12.410 --> 05:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
groups but it's unfortunate that certain
 
05:21:14.930 --> 05:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
groups and and they were the Italians
 
05:21:17.150 --> 05:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
are very right the Italians were very
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
highly persecuted as papists suavi not
 
05:21:23.570 --> 05:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
even human in fact they almost put them
 
05:21:26.930 --> 05:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
in the category of of uh indigenous
 
05:21:30.050 --> 05:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
Africans that's how bad this was in
 
05:21:32.030 --> 05:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
those days so I understand the
 
05:21:34.010 --> 05:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
persecution they did just like many of
 
05:21:36.050 --> 05:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
the African slaves were brought here
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
there was persecution and we have to
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
admit that's part of history but today
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
we don't really have to apologize for it
 
05:21:44.990 --> 05:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
we just have to recognize it we call it
 
05:21:47.150 --> 05:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
this inherited history
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
we'd like to just correct it it's in one
 
05:21:52.128 --> 05:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
easy way without getting into the
 
05:21:54.050 --> 05:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
physical responsibilities of a new
 
05:21:54.060 --> 05:21:54.890 align:start position:0%
physical responsibilities of a new
holiday

05:21:54.890 --> 05:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
holiday
 
05:21:57.770 --> 05:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day is pretty soft History Day
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
if you really think about it it's very
 
05:22:02.530 --> 05:22:02.540 align:start position:0%
easy to change it without changing
 
05:22:05.270 --> 05:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
budgets of towns or anything else all
 
05:22:07.490 --> 05:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
you have to do is say Columbus has
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
historical footnote but indigenous
 
05:22:12.530 --> 05:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
people were here well before that we are
 
05:22:15.410 --> 05:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
doing deep research in the Vikings and
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
you'd be surprised what we're finding in
 
05:22:19.730 --> 05:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
records that show that the Vikings were
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
here not just once up a way up in Nova
 
05:22:24.470 --> 05:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
Scotia but in four locations along the
 
05:22:26.750 --> 05:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
coast here what you also don't realize
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
the fishermen that were here off the
 
05:22:31.610 --> 05:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
coast George's Banks the Gate of the
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
Gulf of Maine there were so many fishing
 
05:22:35.390 --> 05:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
ships out here
 
05:22:37.850 --> 05:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
looking for COD and why was it driven
 
05:22:40.910 --> 05:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
like this the Vatican was seeking to
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
have more fish for Friday and dried fish
 
05:22:45.530 --> 05:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
and who capitalized on that the
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
fishermen from the Iberian Peninsula
 
05:22:49.250 --> 05:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
there were records that there were so
 
05:22:51.948 --> 05:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
many fishing fleets off the coast well
 
05:22:55.128 --> 05:22:55.138 align:start position:0%
before Columbus so what did Columbus do
 
05:22:57.530 --> 05:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
he used he actually went to Iceland and
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
he talked with these the Portuguese
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
fishermen to figure out how to get here
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
he was not the Intrepid Explorer he used
 
05:23:06.050 --> 05:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
other information from fishermen that
 
05:23:08.090 --> 05:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
were already here off the coast from the
 
05:23:11.448 --> 05:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
10th Century on he was 400 maybe 500
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
years late on discovering America people
 
05:23:17.208 --> 05:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
are already getting Commerce here drying
 
05:23:19.010 --> 05:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
Cod bringing back to Europe because he
 
05:23:20.628 --> 05:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
had already depleted the fishing stocks
 
05:23:23.090 --> 05:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
you got to read the Deep history of this
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
world it is really fascinating it is not
 
05:23:27.948 --> 05:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
to be embarrassed we're not trying to
 
05:23:30.288 --> 05:23:30.298 align:start position:0%
embarrass Italians or disparage them
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
it's just it's out of place today
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
let's get real there are indigenous
 
05:23:37.610 --> 05:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
people here in the tens of millions all
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
over the place and it was a very robust
 
05:23:39.958 --> 05:23:41.570 align:start position:0%
over the place and it was a very robust
Society

05:23:41.570 --> 05:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
Society
 
05:23:45.010 --> 05:23:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:48.590 --> 05:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:49.810 --> 05:23:49.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:52.250 --> 05:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
so we've heard this bill several times
 
05:23:54.890 --> 05:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
already and we don't seem to be making
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
any progress right we are okay it's not
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
here in this room right well I know I'm
 
05:24:03.110 --> 05:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
just I'm sorry I'm just talking about
 
05:24:04.970 --> 05:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
this world okay
 
05:24:07.128 --> 05:24:07.138 align:start position:0%
because that's where the bill is
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
so what do you recommend what is it that
 
05:24:11.330 --> 05:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
you really want
 
05:24:13.610 --> 05:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
so we want to change Columbus to
 
05:24:15.350 --> 05:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
indigenous people's day that's why we
 
05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
put a bill forward asking for that we're
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to keep coming back and asking for
 
05:24:21.410 --> 05:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
this I don't care how many times you
 
05:24:23.570 --> 05:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
voted down we'll be back next year and
 
05:24:25.310 --> 05:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
we'll be here asking for the same thing
 
05:24:28.070 --> 05:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the meantime in the short period of
 
05:24:29.690 --> 05:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
time since we've been bringing this bill
 
05:24:31.850 --> 05:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
forward we've already turned over two
 
05:24:34.610 --> 05:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
dozen towns in the state all right we've
 
05:24:37.368 --> 05:24:37.378 align:start position:0%
already turned two school districts all
 
05:24:38.990 --> 05:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
right and possibly three but I have to
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
verify that third one all right so the
 
05:24:44.030 --> 05:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
change is already coming and it's just a
 
05:24:45.890 --> 05:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
matter of the people in this room waking
 
05:24:48.050 --> 05:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
up to recognize that the change is
 
05:24:50.090 --> 05:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
already occurring around them
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
we really believe the Grassroots
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
movement will have enough gravity at
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
some point that this legislature will
 
05:24:58.368 --> 05:24:58.378 align:start position:0%
not be able to ignore this any longer
 
05:25:01.490 --> 05:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:04.250 --> 05:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
the change the city in which this
 
05:25:06.230 --> 05:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
legislature is currently being heard in
 
05:25:08.690 --> 05:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
has already made the change
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
so it's now up to you
 
05:25:14.030 --> 05:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
okay and there's no room for negotiation
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
as far as an amendment or no okay no
 
05:25:19.610 --> 05:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
just want to know what are you going to
 
05:25:21.730 --> 05:25:21.740 align:start position:0%
do celebrate Columbus Day uh you know
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
indigenous people stay the week before
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
and then celebrate Columbus Day the week
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
after that's in celebrating the
 
05:25:29.330 --> 05:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
indigenous people who are originally
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
here and then celebrating our genocide a
 
05:25:34.490 --> 05:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
week later so there is no compromise
 
05:25:37.250 --> 05:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay follow up I just make a comment
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm asking you with good intentions
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't need sarcasm back it's not
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
sarcasm okay all right it sounds like it
 
05:25:47.868 --> 05:25:47.878 align:start position:0%
though no it isn't um the reason why I
 
05:25:49.490 --> 05:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
made that statement is a town here in
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had made that change okay
