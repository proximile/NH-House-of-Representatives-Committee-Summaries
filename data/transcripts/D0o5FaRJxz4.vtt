was if the language uh you know if it
 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
was if the language uh you know if it
expires<00:03:48.080><c> the</c><00:03:48.159><c> end</c><00:03:48.319><c> of</c><00:03:48.400><c> this</c><00:03:48.560><c> year</c><00:03:48.720><c> they</c><00:03:48.879><c> can</c>

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
expires the end of this year they can
 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.869 align:start position:0%

have a problem next year
 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.949 align:start position:0%
have a problem next year
and<00:03:51.840><c> i</c><00:03:52.000><c> think</c><00:03:52.159><c> it</c><00:03:52.159><c> would</c><00:03:52.319><c> make</c><00:03:52.560><c> sense</c><00:03:52.879><c> that</c>

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 align:start position:0%
and i think it would make sense that
 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.309 align:start position:0%
and i think it would make sense that
they<00:03:53.120><c> wouldn't</c>

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
but<00:03:54.560><c> i</c><00:03:54.640><c> don't</c><00:03:54.799><c> know</c><00:03:54.879><c> how</c><00:03:55.040><c> that</c><00:03:55.280><c> works</c><00:03:55.599><c> and</c><00:03:55.680><c> i'm</c>

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how that works and i'm
 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.589 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how that works and i'm
wondering<00:03:56.080><c> if</c><00:03:56.239><c> there's</c><00:03:56.400><c> a</c><00:03:56.480><c> lawyer</c><00:03:56.720><c> in</c><00:03:56.879><c> ols</c><00:03:57.360><c> who</c>

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a lawyer in ols who
 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.350 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a lawyer in ols who
could<00:03:57.920><c> uh</c>

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%

um oh i think i see right
and<00:07:49.039><c> so</c><00:07:49.440><c> if</c><00:07:49.599><c> the</c><00:07:49.840><c> statute</c><00:07:50.319><c> expires</c><00:07:51.440><c> then</c><00:07:51.680><c> there</c>

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so if the statute expires then there
 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.110 align:start position:0%
and so if the statute expires then there
was<00:07:52.000><c> a</c><00:07:52.080><c> year</c><00:07:52.319><c> when</c><00:07:52.479><c> they</c><00:07:52.560><c> had</c><00:07:52.800><c> a</c>

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
was a year when they had a
 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.950 align:start position:0%
was a year when they had a
they<00:07:53.280><c> were</c><00:07:53.360><c> not</c><00:07:53.599><c> operating</c><00:07:54.160><c> and</c><00:07:54.240><c> so</c><00:07:54.479><c> maybe</c><00:07:54.800><c> the</c>

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
they were not operating and so maybe the
 

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.309 align:start position:0%
they were not operating and so maybe the
interpretation<00:07:55.599><c> could</c><00:07:55.759><c> be</c>

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation could be
 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.670 align:start position:0%
interpretation could be
next<00:07:56.560><c> year</c><00:07:56.720><c> in</c><00:07:56.879><c> all</c><00:07:56.960><c> future</c><00:07:57.280><c> years</c><00:07:57.520><c> they</c>

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
next year in all future years they
 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.790 align:start position:0%
next year in all future years they
couldn't<00:07:58.000><c> operate</c><00:07:59.280><c> i</c><00:07:59.360><c> mean</c><00:07:59.520><c> that'd</c><00:07:59.680><c> be</c>

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't operate i mean that'd be
 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.550 align:start position:0%
couldn't operate i mean that'd be
kind<00:08:00.960><c> of</c><00:08:01.120><c> illogical</c><00:08:01.680><c> but</c><00:08:01.840><c> technically</c><00:08:02.319><c> that</c>

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
kind of illogical but technically that
 

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.909 align:start position:0%
kind of illogical but technically that
might<00:08:02.720><c> be</c><00:08:03.199><c> the</c><00:08:03.280><c> way</c><00:08:03.440><c> it</c><00:08:03.520><c> would</c><00:08:03.599><c> work</c>

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
might be the way it would work
 

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.830 align:start position:0%

be covered by the federal waiver it's
 

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.789 align:start position:0%
be covered by the federal waiver it's
it's<00:23:49.600><c> so</c><00:23:50.000><c> tied</c><00:23:50.320><c> in</c><00:23:50.480><c> with</c>

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's so tied in with
 

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:54.149 align:start position:0%
it's so tied in with
federal<00:23:51.919><c> waiver</c><00:23:52.960><c> and</c><00:23:53.200><c> so</c>

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
federal waiver and so
 

00:23:54.159 --> 00:23:56.710 align:start position:0%
federal waiver and so
but<00:23:54.320><c> when</c><00:23:54.480><c> the</c><00:23:54.880><c> federal</c><00:23:55.200><c> waiver</c><00:23:55.760><c> is</c><00:23:56.400><c> pulled</c>

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
but when the federal waiver is pulled
 

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.149 align:start position:0%

00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%

00:23:58.159 --> 00:24:02.149 align:start position:0%

then<00:23:58.720><c> the</c><00:23:59.679><c> authorization</c><00:24:00.400><c> for</c><00:24:00.720><c> it</c><00:24:00.799><c> disappears</c>

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
then the authorization for it disappears
 

00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
then the authorization for it disappears
