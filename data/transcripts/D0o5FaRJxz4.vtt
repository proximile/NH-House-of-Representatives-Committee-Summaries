allergies ah
 
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right so um where we left off
 
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
we had um pretty much agreement on what
 
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
we wanted to see changed
 
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
in this um why don't we start off with
 
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 align:start position:0%
everybody's piece that they had changed
 
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative lekkis are you
 
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to tell us what
 
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
what you got changed i know it was all
 
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
circulated by mr smarling
 
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
right um so there are two aspects
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
one is every place that mentioned uh
 
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is for context this was
 
00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 align:start position:0%
um grandfathering in summer camps that
 
00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.070 align:start position:0%
um grandfathering in summer camps that
that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know have been grandfathered but
 
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
there was the condition that
 
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh it only worked if they operated
 
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.869 align:start position:0%
uh it only worked if they operated
continuously

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
and uh some of them were not able to
 
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
operate uh
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
last summer due to covid and i was
 
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
concerned that at least some of them
 
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.509 align:start position:0%
concerned that at least some of them
might

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
not either not operate or not be able to
 
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
operate at full capacity this year
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully that won't happen but
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
we'll see and so any place that it had
 
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.070 align:start position:0%
we'll see and so any place that it had
uh

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
the summer of 2020 and i changed the
 
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
summers of 2020 and or
 
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
2021 and then we discussed
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
having at sunset at the end of this year
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
and my only concern is i don't know and
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
i put that in the email
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how things are interpreted
 
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.509 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how things are interpreted
uh

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
as far as the law goes um i i put
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
some language in there to cause it to
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
sunset the end of this year
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
but if the law goes away
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
are they still grandfathered in um you
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
know if let's say they weren't operating
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
the way the language works it's clear
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
that uh you know they could operate
 
00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
this summer they'd still be
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in but my concern
 
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
was if the language uh you know if it
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
expires the end of this year they can
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
have a problem next year
 
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 align:start position:0%
and i think it would make sense that
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
but i don't know how that works and i'm
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a lawyer in ols who
 
00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know could give an answer to that
 
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh you know could give an answer to that
so

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
what i'd like the amendment you know the
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
amendment has the uh language to cause
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
it to
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh to sunset and uh um
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
smarling if you know when you put the
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
thing together if you could ask them
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
and if there's any doubt about uh
 
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether they would still be grandfather
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
going forward if it expired then just
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
leave that section out please
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
could you send me a copy of what you've
 
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
got i
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
sent it to the committee email address
 
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 align:start position:0%

you know raise my hand effectively
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
that's the conversation
 
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i don't know you whether you
 
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
can see me
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
i was muted um just a second
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
i can't see you representative schultz
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
schmidt i mean um
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative lekis is you're concerned
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
that with the
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
sunset provision that the camps that are
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
able to operate this year
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and last year would then not be able to
 
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
operate the following year once the
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
statute goes away because
 
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
they were not operating
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
last year is that what i'm my concern is
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
let's say they were not able to operate
 
00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.310 align:start position:0%
let's say they were not able to operate
um

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
last year due to covid and let's say you
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
know kova is not a problem this year
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
so you know clearly they'd be able to
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
operate this summer
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh but with the statue ending at the end
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
of this year expiring at the end of this
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
year would they have a problem next year
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the years going forward
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
um and i just don't know you know what
 
00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:02.550 align:start position:0%
um and i just don't know you know what
happens

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know how that's interpreted you know
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
by courts
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
and miss marlin i sent you i just sent
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
you a copy okay if we can get an opinion
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think it it would because to to say
 
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.110 align:start position:0%
i think it it would because to to say
otherwise

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
would be um just because the law expired
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
it was the law at the time
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
so but yeah but but it's you know it's
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
an issue of
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
looking at what their situation is going
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
forward after the laws expired i
 
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i think it kind of makes logical
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
sense that they'd be okay
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh but sometimes i know the way uh
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
things are interpreted does not
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
go along with common sense logic so that
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
was my concern
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
that's crazy sorry i believe
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative lucas said if
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
you sunset and um
 
00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
a statute then the previous statute that
 
00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
a statute then the previous statute that
applied

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
takes over right but they're
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay yeah he's concerned that
 
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.070 align:start position:0%
okay yeah he's concerned that
retroactively

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
they would look back and see that they
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
didn't operate since the statute that
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
allowed them to
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
continue grandfather because they
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't operate would then
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
affect them but i think that just a
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
quick opinion from all that won't kill
 
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:13.029 align:start position:0%
quick opinion from all that won't kill
us

00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
to get the confusion out of it
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt why would they
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
have not what would be a reason for them
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
not opening if they could
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
oh well only if they couldn't
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
my concern is this um is let's say they
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
could not open last year
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
um because of coded and
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
the uh you know this the amendment here
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
let them open the issue is the previous
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
law was that they could
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
continue their non-conforming use as
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
long as they operated every year
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
um oh i think i see right
 
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so if the statute expires then there
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
was a year when they had a
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
they were not operating and so maybe the
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation could be
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
next year in all future years they
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't operate i mean that'd be
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
kind of illogical but technically that
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
might be the way it would work
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
you could write in the amendment that
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
you can write something in the amendment
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
failure to open due to covid is not a
 
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.869 align:start position:0%
failure to open due to covid is not a
reason

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
to um you can refer to that statute
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
and say that failure to not open
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
would not but would not account for
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
um you know not being open a year
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
based on unconventional use
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean if we just get rid of the
 
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.110 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean if we just get rid of the
fires

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
fires
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
if it expires that doesn't mean anything
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
either except for it would give
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
right so i mean the easiest thing might
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
be not to have it expired the only
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
reason i want to have it expired
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
is you know years from now we still have
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
this thing in the rsas that um
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know it was an artifact of covid but
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
it might actually be necessary to leave
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
it in that was my concern
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
well we'll see from ols okay
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
well you've been kind of massaging the
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
issue i wanted to address mr chairman
 
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.750 align:start position:0%
issue i wanted to address mr chairman
but

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh clearly the pandemic is an
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstance
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh that you want to factor in and
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that's what you're trying to do
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative lekis
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
but but uh i think the language has to
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
reflect that that that
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's only the extraordinary circumstance
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
that um takes away the previous
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
stipulation that they had to be
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
effectively in continuous operation
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
and and to the degree that they
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
would not open for other reasons because
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody died ownership
 
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.750 align:start position:0%
let's say somebody died ownership
transferred

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
they you know they had financial
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
difficulties whatever
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
that would not fall under the
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
rubric of the pandemic at all that you
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
now you're trying to figure out how you
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
want to handle it and so i just think
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
that the language has to reflect uh the
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary circumstance aspect and
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
nothing else because otherwise you're
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
going to say or if this
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
this or this now you're setting up all
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
kinds of additional
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions so the language
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
clearly deals only with code
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
right right very clear but but it
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
running it past an attorney is the
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do that's why they
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
that's why they study law because they
 
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.230 align:start position:0%
that's why they study law because they
have

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to put things in
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
language that that meets the legal
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
requirements and you could you can see
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
we are struggling with that aspect
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
right i agree that's what i i asked for
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh miss marley when she put
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
exactly i see i see where you're going
 
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
exactly i see i see where you're going
and

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
putting it running it past the attorney
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do okay
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
okay let's move along i don't want to
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
get tied up on this piece of it um
 
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
please what do you have to tell us about
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
the proportion you had done
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
are you speaking i'm sorry did you hear
 
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
did you say representative grota
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
i did yes okay yes so i had outdoor
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
dining and i got input
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
input from both um
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh darren from everyone actually darren
 
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:22.870 align:start position:0%
uh darren from everyone actually darren
windham

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
windham
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
um uh margaret burns and uh
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
rob tardif and the
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
document that i put together was
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
circulated to the to the group
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
um i think we have something that's
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
easier to say
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment the part of the amendment
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
in red
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
it says so let me read it restaurants
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%

um municipal

septic tank or
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
a sewer so the original language that
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
was sent to me by des said that if the

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
i took i'd like to take that out and say
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
for establishments that
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
are on municipal sewer they can expand
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
seating as the municipality
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
allows because the sewers are municipal
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's okay with everyone the
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
this sentence would be or other
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
they can expand seating as the
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
municipality allows
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and then new hampshire
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
municipal association out of the
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
sentence outdoor dining expansions
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
are subject to all other applicable
 
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.150 align:start position:0%

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
regulations and ordinances very good
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
so that clarifies the wishiwashi
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
um well let's not call it that let the
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
unclear reference to local
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
rule so and then the rest of it stays
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
so what i can do is if everyone agrees i
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
can send
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
to you all that new
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
condensed version yeah send it to um ms
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
smarling too please because she's
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to wrap all this together into one
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
um one
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
amendment okay um did anyone else

00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
i guess not so let me
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%

thank you i'm not sure if this is the
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
right time in the scheme of things but
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention today and
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
this is hard for me to keep track of so
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh i hope i'm not referring to something
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
that has already been fixed
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh but on page three uh lines
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
16 to 20 is a section that begins with
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%

it has one for the army it has one for
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
the air force but it was brought to my
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
quite foreign page 3

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
i just want to say to representative
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
allegro it's nice to
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%

computer previously showed up as a very
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
very tiny
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh undiscernable dot and
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%

which you're talking about uh
 
00:15:36.839 --> 00:15:39.829 align:start position:0%
which you're talking about uh
sp155

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
sp155
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
page three lines 16 to 20 and starting
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
on line 16
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
section 4 says current and former
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
military service members
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
who have been assigned a military
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty code
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
of 68w in parentheses army
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
or 4no 4n0x1
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
parentheses air force with or without
 
00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:04.389 align:start position:0%
parentheses air force with or without
additional

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
skill and so on and a constituent
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention that it
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
didn't mention navy corn
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
so this is in reference to the temporary
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
health partners
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i assume he's talking about it it
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
lets former military medics
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
be able to uh to use this
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
if they've been doing it within the last
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
three years and it's only just the air
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
force in the army
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
um so what we need is uh the military
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
occupational specialty number
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
mos or whatever it's called in the navy
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
for an av
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
corpsman i wonder if we can just say
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
but military without getting into the
 
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:49.350 align:start position:0%
but military without getting into the
specific

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
i mean because we're going to forget the
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
coast guard and we're going to forget
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the marines and we're going to forget
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
the space force
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative roy yes sorry to
 
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
representative roy yes sorry to
interrupt

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
interrupt
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
but this section should actually be
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
deleted here
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
because we dealt with this in a house
 
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.829 align:start position:0%
because we dealt with this in a house
bill

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we resolve the issue of the
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
of all the forces and the proper codes
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
and this so this section is duplicative
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
i forget what number it is i think it's
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 145 but i'll i'll get it to
 
00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.710 align:start position:0%
house bill 145 but i'll i'll get it to
you

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
that particular section is unnecessary
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
and should be deleted
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
well that saves us a lot of work thank
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
you for interrupting glad to help
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
um okay so can i just clarify what needs
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
what will be deleted it looks like
 
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.870 align:start position:0%
what will be deleted it looks like

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
four um just paragraph four
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanna make sure i understand
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
request if you're just taking out
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph four
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
yeah let's wait until um representative
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
maguire sends
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
if representative mcguire if you can
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
send it to ms smarling too
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
just to make sure the language is um
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%

you know i i'll wait to hear from
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire i'm
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not you know confident that
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's that does it i mean if it does

that's great
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
but i yeah well we'll just do a side by
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
side and make sure that it's
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the issues covered and taken care of and
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
if it is then we'll just delete
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
that paragraph i will just add that was
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
an incorrect bill number i just looked
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
up house bill 145
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
and it's a different title and it was
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
killed so
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
okay well that's why we're going to hold
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
off and wait and zero
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the other question is is has that
 
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
house bill that she's referring to
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
yeah well we'll we'll we'll put a pin in
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
that and um
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
if if it has been does everyone agree
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that that we can delete that section if
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
taken care of in another bill that looks
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
like it's going to pass or has passed
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah all right right so um
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
my section that i had to take care of
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
was the definition
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
what did a temporary health partner
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:38.450 align:start position:0%
and defined it if i could find
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
and defined it if i could find
[Music]

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
the language mr smarling sent me in this
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the definition of a temporary health
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
partner is going to mean is
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
the definition will be means a health
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
partner who has been hired under the
 
00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.110 align:start position:0%
partner who has been hired under the
process

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
authorized according to federal and
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
state waivers
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
so the concern we had was what did that
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
mean temporary health partner how long
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
would it last
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
is it are we creating a whole new
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
section of
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh employee or lna a whole new
 
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.510 align:start position:0%
uh employee or lna a whole new
classification

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
classification
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
so i spoke to the
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
people at the nursing and they don't
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
want this to be
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
necessarily a new a new um
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
alternative way to get your license
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
permanently this is just
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
for for for the people who worked under
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
the cove state of emergency
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
so the definition therefore applies only
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
to people who were hired
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
under the state of emergency federal or
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes are regulated by the by
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
much more than the state and they're
 
00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
very particular about
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
waivers and such so this
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
in this bill for the purposes of this
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
bill temporary health partner would mean
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
people that were hired
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
under this waiver granted by the federal
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
government and the state because of
 
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:04.950 align:start position:0%
government and the state because of
covert

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
covert
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
does everyone follow that i understand
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
i would just say i would be supportive
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
of looking at this
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
um not in a way obviously that would
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
hurt anything with federal regulations
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
um but i would still be open to this
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
being something we look at permanently
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm glad you said that because after
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with the um
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
folks over there uh they are very
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
interested in
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
us doing something like that in the fall
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we could co-sponsor something
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
i would love to work with you on that
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i i agree as well
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah and i told her when we talked
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and um the idea of an alternative
 
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.789 align:start position:0%
and um the idea of an alternative
pathway

00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
to for people who can't afford the
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
upfront money because the problem is to
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
go to the class
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
you have to come up with the upfront
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
money you'll get reimbursed but if you
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the upfront money
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
um you just can't do it so
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
be a problem yeah yeah so we can work we
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
can work on it massage it and look at it
 
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.510 align:start position:0%
can work on it massage it and look at it
um

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the fall so does everyone okay with
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
can you please just repeat it one more
 
00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:21.990 align:start position:0%
can you please just repeat it one more
time

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
i was trying to listen to everything i
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
sort of lost to the original if you
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't mind please no that's fine
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
um okay so the we were concerned that
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
there was no definition of what
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
temporary health partner meant
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
so the what it's going to mean is that
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
a temporary health partner means a
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
health partner who has been hired
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
under the process authorizing authorized
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
according to federal and state waivers
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay so very simple only people that
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
were hired under this
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and were granted
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
waivers by the state and federal
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
government would be the people eligible
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's what i thought the
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
final outcome was
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
yeah does that section then be included
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the repeals in the back part of the
 
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.270 align:start position:0%
in the repeals in the back part of the
bill

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.310 align:start position:0%
bill
um

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
seems logical to do that if what what
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
are you asking the representative
 
00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be included in the
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
repeals in the back part of the
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
bill all the definition you mean
 
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
well the yeah the category i guess you
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
the section um mr marlin
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
are you with us i am i am
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
um i think the the idea was that we
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
we we wouldn't know when the pandemic
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
might end and
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
and when this this position would not
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
be covered by the federal waiver it's
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's so tied in with
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
federal waiver and so
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
but when the federal waiver is pulled
 
00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.149 align:start position:0%
but when the federal waiver is pulled
away

00:23:58.149 --> 00:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
then the authorization for it disappears
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
so that's the difficulty with
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
identifying a date
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
unless you try to craft a contingency
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
but it seemed
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
um you know the other issue that we
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
talked about yesterday was putting this
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
into session law rather than
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
statue um so it
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
had less of a feeling of permanence
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's right um revised language so
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
that amend session law
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
rather than obviously 360 230 excuse me
 
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.230 align:start position:0%
rather than obviously 360 230 excuse me
326b

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
326b
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
so does that does that answer your
 
00:24:33.279 --> 00:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
so does that does that answer your
concern

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative yes i think that would be
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay i do see representative
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
mcguire's hand up also
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
i i think representative mcguire did you
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
want to speak again
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that it ever got lowered
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually yes thank you mr chair it's
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
567 it would replace
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
lines 20 through 24 on page 3
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
which is roman 4 and 5 and
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
i was trying to research the question
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
of coast guard and other military codes
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
because this came up when we were
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with the house bill
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
and somehow
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
it resolved in favor of the language in
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 567
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
however uh if that is still in the
 
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.190 align:start position:0%
however uh if that is still in the
senate

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
it has not yet passed um
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
so you could either add
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
a modify these to the language of house
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
bill 567
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
or just delete them or put in a clause
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
that this section doesn't apply if 567
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
uh passes and i like that
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
anyway i will try and find the link why
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
worry about the other services they may
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
have the same codes as
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
army or air force uh i don't know
 
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.789 align:start position:0%
army or air force uh i don't know
exactly

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
i don't remember exactly what we
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
resolved but i remember that we did in
 
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
fact resolve it
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay um i like the idea of uh
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
putting a clause in that says this
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
section shall not apply if
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
um five was it five sixty four you said
 
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
um five was it five sixty four you said
passes

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
five six five six seven
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
by six i agree that that's the simplest
 
00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
by six i agree that that's the simplest
way

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
to resolve that does everyone on the
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee agree
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
to do with that we'll just have some
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
sorry yes i do um we'll we'll
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
need to just review all this once we
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
get a little firmer in the amendment but
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely i've made a note of it
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so i believe that that
 
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.630 align:start position:0%
thanks okay so i believe that that
covers

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
covers
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
um everything that we were going to
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
discuss um
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
with this bill does anyone have any
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
all right let me just okay
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
let's see none i will go ahead and call
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
the roll
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
um let me see are we calling this as
 
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:27.990 align:start position:0%
um let me see are we calling this as
amended

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
amended
or

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
is that how we would do this one
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
which which where are we going we're
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
vote i'm going to make a motion but i
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
need to know if i should call it
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
as amended or because
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be amendments discussed in
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
these sections
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
per the subject yeah okay
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to make a motion of
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
wait peter wants to say something i
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
think we have to do this in committee
 
00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
think we have to do this in committee
not

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
not in subcommittee
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
well we have to we have to vote on the
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yeah
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman so i
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
heard you say
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
the bill uh and the bill uh
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
also well it doesn't yet contain the
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
non-germain amendment because that
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't yet been adopted by
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
the committee uh but are you intending
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
to uh to incorporate
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
the non-german amendment into your
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
motion uh
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
in in in the just in the vote or is that
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
extraneous at this point that's
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
extraneous at this point the non-german
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is actually scheduled for a
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing next week
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
because it was so non-germane that it
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
was inappropriate to not
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
um i thank you very much for that
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
clarification i think that's important
 
00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:50.950 align:start position:0%
clarification i think that's important
and

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
i'm i had not heard that there was going
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
to be a public hearing
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
but i fully agree with that thank you
 
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:57.750 align:start position:0%
but i fully agree with that thank you
yeah

00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
they just clarified that which jerk
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%
there have been more than one
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
non-german amendments on some bills is
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
this the one that's about
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's about vaccines so the vaccine
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
part is going to be a separate amendment
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
now and is it with the
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
provisions about outdoor dining
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
um no the
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
the vaccine portion is it's going to be
 
00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
its own
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
separate hearings yeah a separate year
 
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
right but it has to be amended
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
it has to be attached to something it's
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
not a the non-jermaine amendment is not
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
a separate bill it has to be attached to
 
00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:38.470 align:start position:0%
a separate bill it has to be attached to
something

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
so if it's not attached to this bill
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
then well it's going to be attack
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to attach it to this bill
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
but it's as it's a non-german amendment
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
we have to have the public hearing
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
no no that that's i'm not disagreeing
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
with with that aspect at all
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
but representative schultz i think was
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
unclear as to whether it's going to be
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
attached and it would have to be
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
attached to this
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
but it will come after the separate
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct so what we're doing
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee right now is we're
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
just going to
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
vote that the changes we made are
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
approved by the subcommittee
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
and refer it to the um to the full
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
committee right at which point we'll
 
00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.350 align:start position:0%
committee right at which point we'll
have

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have the public hearing on
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
the laundromat amendment first before we
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
take up the actual whole
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
right that's good process yes
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
we could just for clarification when we
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the motion
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
um to accept these we're talking about
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
the summer camps
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
the outdoor dining and the
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
health partners so let's make sure that
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the motion we mentioned these three
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
things so that there's no confusion as
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
i said hunky dory sounds good wait now
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm confused again because the amount of
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
law was just wasn't just outdoor dining
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
it also included the
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
vaccine portions no we didn't discuss
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
that today chris
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
i mean we didn't discuss that today i'm
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
saying the amendment i saw about
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining page two continuing that
 
00:31:07.679 --> 00:31:08.710 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining page two continuing that
amendment

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
was vaccines so that's why i'm confused
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
yes representative schultz the
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
that was an amen the non-jermaine
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
amendment included something on outdoor
 
00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
amendment included something on outdoor
dining

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
dining
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
but the amendment that you
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
that your committee has worked

newer version obviously is a little more
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
controversial but anyway
