afternoon commissioner Tammy
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that the this
 
00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.450 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that the this
grant

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
um ends next year
 
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
and so my question is what's what is an
 
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
apartment's plan to continue this system
 
00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 align:start position:0%
of care work
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the period of the Federal grant
 
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
is it in the budget or
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
um how how will we continue the work so
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
there are appropriation requests that
 
00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
are included in the budgeting process
 
00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
but as well we will seek both no cost
 
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
extensions as well as reapply for the
 
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.749 align:start position:0%
extensions as well as reapply for the
grant

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
um some of parts of the grant program
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
are continuing on and we will seek and
 
00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 align:start position:0%
apply for those from the federal
 
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.270 align:start position:0%
apply for those from the federal
government

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell for a question
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
um also in the same
 
00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 align:start position:0%
um where it says increasing family
 
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
engagement and expanding professional
 
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
development what type of professional
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
development are are we so most of the
 
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
professional development around the
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
system of care Grant is in our mtssb
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
work which is multi-tier System of
 
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
support behavioral setup and so
 
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're doing is we're
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
working specifically with school
 
00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
districts there are seven districts in
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
the program right now where we help them
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
develop uh relationships and really a
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
framework to interconnect with the
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
community around them to provide
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
supports to students the way that mtssb
 
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 align:start position:0%
works is we have Universal support So at
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
the lowest level and that's kind of
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
every student needs some degree of
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
support I like to describe it as we have
 
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
to teach kids not to stick their gum
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
under the table and then it escalates
 
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 align:start position:0%
from there level two is kids who maybe
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
need some more support and then up to
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
level three which is generally where
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
we're referring them outside of the
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
school system to get support and by
 
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
building that mtssp kind of Coalition of
 
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
both the school and the community we're
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
able to more seamlessly interconnect
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
those students to support services great
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald is recognized for a
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
question great to see you back likewise
 
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.350 align:start position:0%
question great to see you back likewise
Senator

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
um so we're accepting another 16 million
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm just wondering
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
how many more households and
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
how much more money per household will
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
we be able to
 
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
help Granite Staters with sure
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so if uh looking at just sort of the
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
average numbers that we've seen so far
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
this season currently the average
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
benefit has just been shy of two
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per household there is
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
a matrix that determines the actual
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
amount that any particular household
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
will receive based on income based on
 
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
fuel type as well as
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
household size as well so rather than
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
depending on how much money we get it's
 
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.340 align:start position:0%
dependent on a number of other factors
 
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
that is within those matrices so if we
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
were to say okay assume that every
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
single uh you know we were to see
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
additional enrollment to eat up this
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
entire fund uh this entire appropriation
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
of the extra 60 16 million it would
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
cover about 8 400 additional households
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
assuming um everybody was in at the
 
00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
average benefit of just less than two
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell moves to approve FIS
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%

dealing with the Department of
 
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:28.080 align:start position:0%

and we see commissioner arlinghaus
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%

hi uh I'm Charlie arlinghaus I'm the

plant and property
 
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Rosenwald is
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you I
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
um so as I was reading this item
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
last year when we started it it was for
 
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.180 align:start position:0%
ventilation improvements
 
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
but now it seems like you want to
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
repurpose the funds
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
for building envelope which I think must
 
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
mean the outside of the building
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
um Paving
 
00:10:20.449 --> 00:10:20.459 align:start position:0%
life safety
 
00:10:20.459 --> 00:10:21.889 align:start position:0%
life safety
hyping

00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
hyping
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
and improvements to Interior spaces have
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
have we decided that ventilation is all
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
good no we're not even close
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
um we're still very Pro ventilation and
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
as you know many of the state buildings
 
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:38.110 align:start position:0%
as you know many of the state buildings
have

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
let's just put it mediocre ventilation
 
00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
and and my understanding is we still
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
consider fresh air to be a good thing
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and um there are actually two
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
separate arpa items and they're the one
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
of them you approved this transfer for
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
last month
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
when I was not here and you got to talk
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
to Sherry about it I think Karen too but
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not positive
 
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and that's that that is strictly
 
00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:08.459 align:start position:0%
speaking for HVAC sort of issues this
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
item is a is a this item is a separate
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
item the description refers to both of
 
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
them but this item is the non-hvac stuff
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
and so they're each about 20 million
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
give or take and the item last month was
 
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:24.260 align:start position:0%
all the HVAC because it's a separate
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
arpa category I believe that because
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
there's a specifically called out in
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
arpa where this is just sort of General
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance around the state so
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
this is think of this item as non-hvac
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
and the old item the item from last
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
month as HVAC
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
HVAC meaning ventilation the V is for
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
ventilation just oh please further
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you it's Friday afternoon
 
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling so
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh there were two different items one
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
was for ventilation one was for General
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
repairs but the explanation refers to
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
both of them yes and that was a and
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
that's probably something we shouldn't
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
have done okay but got it thank you
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.130 align:start position:0%

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
23082 all in favor say aye aye opposed
 
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
no that motion carries we'll move on to

tab ten
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
in the regular calendar the first item
 
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:42.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:44.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the item
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Nathan white Chief

Financial Officer
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Ellen Lapointe CEO at New
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital thank you
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
um so this item is
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
short-term Staffing contracts it's my
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have like
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
30 or so beds at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
that were not able to
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
operate because we don't have Staffing
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
well this money allow us to reopen those
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
beds so that New Hampshire hospital will
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
be running at full capacity
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Senator and I
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
wish I could tell you the answer was yes
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
but no unfortunately this money won't
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
further assist us in opening additional
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
beds the reason for that is because this
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
money is actually a request to
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
reallocate funding for the expenses that
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
we've already incurred for our agency
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
and temporary staff to be able to make
 
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that has the department
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
making a bigger transfer so that we
 
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.949 align:start position:0%
making a bigger transfer so that we
could

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
open up all the beds and get people out
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
of emergency departments or would that
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
so I I think there's two elements to
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
this and and I'll defer to to Ellen on
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
the on the hiring
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
um there are challenges with hiring the
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
nurses and the social workers and and
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
other key positions at New Hampshire
 
00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
hospital right now so even if we were to
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
transfer funds for personnel there would
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
be challenges there and then Ellen I
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to speak to the
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
to the wings as well
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again senator for the
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
question so um in terms of work that's
 
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
being done to address the the closed
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
beds at New Hampshire hospital it's very
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
much a priority on behalf of the
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
hospital as well as the department and
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're working on several plans in order
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
to try to expedite that and make it a
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
top priority so that we can reopen those
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
beds however an additional concern that
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
has happened within the last several
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
weeks is when we had that very cold
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
weather back in February there was a
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
sprinkler head that burst in New
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and thankfully the
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
week prior to that we had vacated those
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
two sister units in their entirety and
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's where the open beds at New
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital currently reside
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
however it caused a significant amount
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
of damage at those locations that
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
required a significant amount of
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
demolition so from a staffing
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
perspective we have concerns and now
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
from an environmental perspective we
 
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
also have significant concerns in that
 
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
also have significant concerns in that
space

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.129 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:15:52.129 --> 00:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
for the questions from committee members
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
Senator Dallas Andrew thank you Mr
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh with with regard to those
 
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
beds we appropriate it buddy in the last
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
Pioneer to do the transition from where
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
the young kids were to where adults were
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
how how have how how far have we
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
progressed in terms of could that
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
conversion situation because that was to
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
create 40 40 additional meds
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question Senator I
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify are you talking
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
about the renovation that we that was
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
approved funding was approved for a
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
renovation of those two units I'm
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
talking about yes the money that we
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
allocated to take the the rooms that the
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
children were occupying and to convert
 
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
them to adult beds there were 20 of
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
those and uh when you converted them to
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
adult we created 40 more spaces thank
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying that question for me
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
so I understood so at the time
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
um that the beds that the children were
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
in were vacated during covid we did
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
actually without having pursued the
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
renovation at that time
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
Implement those beds for Adult Services
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
so um at the peak of covet our maximum
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
census was approximately 184.
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
um since then we've lost significant
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
Staffing which has yielded the need to
 
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:18.260 align:start position:0%
close those units
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
and have the deficit of 31 beds that we
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
have currently
 
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
further questions about the item from
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Steve Lavoy director of
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
administration hi Steve thank you Mr
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
chairman so it seems to me if I ended up
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
like we're spending about over six
 
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year in
 
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
credit card fees
 
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:28.580 align:start position:0%
at the DMV is that
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for do we
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
charge a convenience fee to customers
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
who are using their credit cards
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
we do not and that's what these expenses
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
represent these are the costs that the
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
department pays the merchant service
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
providers for accepting payment by
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
credit card we don't currently charge a
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
convenience fee
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
um that would be another alternative to
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
covering some of these costs could I
 
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
follow up would you have the statutory
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
authority to do that we do have the
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority yes
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay why aren't you doing yeah I mean
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
why are we losing money so it's your
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
customer convenience It's a combination
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
of both a business decision and a
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
budgetary decision
 
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
um if if we don't have the funding in
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
our budget to cover these costs we're
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
really forced as a department to
 
00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
implement a convenience fee
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
when online transactions were first
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
introduced at the DMV we really wanted
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
to encourage people to move in that
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
direction and so at the time convenience
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
fees were viewed as a deterrent to doing
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
so if there's an additional cost
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
um to processing online times have
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
changed and now it's common for
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
convenience fees to be assessed and so
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
um again it's really a combination of of
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
a business and a budgetary decision uh
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not we would continue to move
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
forward with with that practice at this
 
00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:03.289 align:start position:0%
forward with with that practice at this
point

00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't be in a position to make
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that change this fiscal year and we've
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
been having those discussions with house
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
finance division two as far as moving it
 
00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.810 align:start position:0%
finance division two as far as moving it
forward

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm sure we'll have
 
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
discussions in the Senate as well
 
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
Senator de Alessandro for a question
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Jim first of all
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
Stevie congratulations
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
your elevation
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you assistant Commission of the
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
department but with regard to the fee
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
Steve it it seems to be in today's world
 
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.730 align:start position:0%
Steve it it seems to be in today's world
everyone

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
that accepted the credit cards as
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
charging that fee and I I see it all the
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
time when I go to a restaurant that they
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
add additional three percent if you use
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
so we're really remiss if if we're not
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
on top of that and when you look at
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
these numbers uh this represents a lot a
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
lot of money a significant amount of
 
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.730 align:start position:0%
lot of money a significant amount of
money

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
so I I know with the Senate we'll be
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
looking at at that
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
I look at the the two move movers
 
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
and Shake it's here the trio right and
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
so the five of us are here The Three
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
Amigos and and us two will be looking at
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you this wasn't my topic Mr chair
 
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
but I I just would say that I eat out a
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
lot these days unfortunately no home
 
00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
cooking for me I don't see a three
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
percent credit card fee the only time I
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
see it is in the state cafeteria
 
00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
downstairs sir or or when I go to my
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
Auburn uh town to do dog fees you know I
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
I I'm okay with government not slapping
 
00:21:48.169 --> 00:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
a extra transaction on I I would assume
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
that we have uh advantages to making
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
sure that our cash flow that we're not
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
having uh shrinkage in our cash
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
collections if we have everything
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
electronic it's it's a for our
 
00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:05.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
address that
 
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.210 align:start position:0%
address that
um

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
at the particular restaurants that I go
 
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
to I've seen the three percent addressed
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
all the time uh and uh
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
and I think more and more and more as as
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
cards are becoming the way to do
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
business a very few people have cash I
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
know my kids don't know that cash exists
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh they get you know wallets full of
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
credit cards I never had a credit card
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I uh the three percent didn't bother
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
me until I got one but I think it's it's
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's the rule of thumb as we speak
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
so you're lucky you're very fortunate if
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
if it's not happening McDonald's is just
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.049 --> 00:22:56.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
but Senator dallasandra thank you uh it
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we make this every year
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
you come to us every year for this
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
transfer why don't we just appropriate
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
properly well we're building the budget
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
rather than come here for it for for a
 
00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:07.730 align:start position:0%
rather than come here for it for for a
transfer

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
it would not hurt our feelings sir but
 
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:12.980 align:start position:0%
uh that that is the way we're budgeting
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes sir it just it just seems to be
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
every year we we come if we if we if we
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
do this and that's it's
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
wasted paper well it's a different every
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
year sometimes we have a terrible winter
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
and they might come in for twice as much
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have a nice winter and they
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
don't need to move much so but they're
 
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
always coming in I know but I credit
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
them with being very accurate at what
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
the costs are right that's what I always
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
look for and people working on money yes
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
sir we we do try the uh the variability
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
of of winters does change our requests
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
if you recall we were here not too long
 
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.710 align:start position:0%
if you recall we were here not too long
ago

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
um the recent storm events that
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
continued higher use of uh rented trucks
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
and the increased material costs uh
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
inflation is is why we're back
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
I won't knock on wood but but uh
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh we're we're winding down
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman some of us
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't live in the big city
 
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
like Manchester but where I live we got
 
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
like 35 inches of snow and Peterborough
 
00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:27.539 align:start position:0%
just to yes sir a week or two ago we
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
still have some left but I did have a
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
question if I could miss a chair on um
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
the class 20 item on page two you
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned the anti-icing materials you
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
use I know you're using the salt and was
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
it uh brine are you using anything else
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
that may be less environmentally
 
00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
sensitive because I've heard from
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
Peterborough even and people rather in
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
my area that have had some salt
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
contamination issues or you moving to
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
other things like I hear nitrogen is
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes used now there are sensitive
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
we also use sand in some areas but I do
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
have our operations uh experts here if
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
they can tell you about other things
 
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
we've looked at we do look at an
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
extensive range of materials
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
Balance cost and environmental impact of
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
all those materials but we're
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
continually testing
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
um Alan uh go ahead and introduce
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
yourself good afternoon
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Alan Hanscom State
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance engineer we do we
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
have experimented with uh different
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
chemicals at various times potassium
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
acetate and others comes at a
 
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
significant cost increase
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
um to uh
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
almost an order of magnitude at times so
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
we would be here more often
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
if we did switch that over but it's it's
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
a significant cost of uh four to five
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
dollars per gallon versus uh
 
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
uh 85 dollars a ton for salt so we we
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
have we have tried and
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
um but we didn't find it cost effective
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
for the question I could thanks Mr
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess I'm just concerned
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
because we hear more and more about
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
water contamination in my division
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
division one and the cost that that's
 
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.730 align:start position:0%
division one and the cost that that's
now

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
um basically bearing down on the state
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
with the requests we're getting from the
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
I'm just that's the way I guess I'm
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
asking the question because
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
there may be significant savings by
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
using the more cheaper salt but the
 
00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
long-term effect down the road and I do
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
have one
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
follow up if I could Mr chairman on
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
you noted in class 22 again on the
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
second page that that is going up
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
obviously because of the outside
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
contractors but have you seen a decline
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance Bureau to offset
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for for additional
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
funding because you have to hire so many
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
contractors right
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
sir I mean at the moment this is due to
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
vacancy vacancies this is not an optimal
 
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.810 align:start position:0%
vacancy vacancies this is not an optimal
situation

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:10.820 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
hired trucks we have always used and
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
will continue to use because we staff
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
for summer we don't staff for winter
 
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance otherwise we'd have a lot of
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
excess staff during the non-winter
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
months so the higher trucks are used to
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
to fill that Delta
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
um our vacancy rate comes at an
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance things like Bridge
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
washing other things that extend the
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
life of our infrastructure aren't being
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
done because of our vacancy rate right
 
00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
now so reducing head count in that case
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
would would just further exacerbate that
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
situation and and in our view at least
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
lead to a long-term degradation of our
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
transportation infrastructure
 
00:28:59.930 --> 00:28:59.940 align:start position:0%
I guess my question wasn't clear I'm
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman I'm further question
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
wondering where you said that uh I
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
understand the vacancy rates and
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
everybody is having that problem but
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
have you seen a large drop in your
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance Bureau budget
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
obviously if you're not doing all these
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
things I would guess it'd be a
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
just moments are I'll let Danielle take
 
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir I didn't hear the question
 
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
could you repeat the question for me
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you on page two class 22 it was
 
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:40.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you know we all know
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
about the vacancy rate and all the
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
Departments but I was just curious if
 
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.389 align:start position:0%
Departments but I was just curious if
the

00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
line had changed significantly within
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
your Highway Maintenance Bureau as far
 
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:55.820 align:start position:0%
as expenses because of that
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and not being able to
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
assist assistant commissioner said wash
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
Bridges and do other maintenance is that
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the class 22 for a class 22 that's
 
00:30:09.169 --> 00:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
specific for specifically for the rented
 
00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
equipment the reason why there's been
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
such a change in that in addition to the
 
00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:15.779 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate is the fuel surcharge
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's paid because it's also tied to
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
the fuel fluctuations that are occurring
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm having trouble Mr chairman
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just looking at the yeah again
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
have you seen a mark decline in the
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance Bureau budget
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
because of the lack no if you're having
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
lower miles on some of the trucks is it
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
saving you yeah some of the other costs
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
no sir our trucks are are fully utilized
 
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
due to our volunteers
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
so uh it's an all hands on deck effort

budget at a higher rate

00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
Senator Roswell I appreciate that
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
question talking about the end of this
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year this is amount this amount
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
we're asking for today is to make us
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
whole for this fiscal year we were at a
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
disadvantage when we forecasted the last
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
biennium budget because we did not know
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
how much contracted a medical Provider
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
Services were going to cost and that
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
makes up a large portion this ask we
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
have that information in the budget we
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
have before the house and soon to be
 
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
before the Senate so we feel very
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
confident in those numbers and I'm
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
careful when I say that but we feel very
 
00:35:10.089 --> 00:35:10.099 align:start position:0%

00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is John clinch
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior audit manager with the
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
office of legislative budget assistant
 
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
and I was the auditor in charge for this
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
audit the weatherization assistance
 
00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.930 align:start position:0%
audit the weatherization assistance
program

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:38:59.329 --> 00:38:59.339 align:start position:0%
uh which I'm here to present today
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
as shown on the transmittal letter on
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral one
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
the objective of our audit was to
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
determine if the weatherization
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
assistance program was efficiently and
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
effectively overseeing Community Action
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
agencies weatherization services
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
our audit period was primarily State
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 when the legislature
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
placed it under the department of energy
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
which is known here as the New Hampshire
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire energy
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
please turn to our executive summary on
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
we found New Hampshire Energy's
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
monitoring program was generally
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
effective and the program had exceeded
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
its expected Statewide number of
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
dwellings weatherized in two of the
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
three state fiscal years for which we
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
requested Federal reports
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
the program functions primarily in an
 
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
oversight and Grant Management role
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
while the Community Action agencies
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
qualify and serve clients based on
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
federal statutes regulations and program
 
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
federal statutes regulations and program
guidelines

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
We Believe with a new administrative
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
support provided by New Hampshire energy
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
and implementing our recommendations the
 
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
program appears to be well positioned to
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
improve its operating efficiency and
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness which will be especially
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
important as it receives an additional
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
18.2 million dollars from the federal
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan infrastructure law through
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
the end of State fiscal year 2027.
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
our recommendation summary starts on
 
00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
our report had six observations and the
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy fully concurred
 
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
with all recommendations no observations
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
will require legislative action
 
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
our background section begins on page
 
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.450 align:start position:0%
our background section begins on page
five

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
it contained a brief description of the
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
including the program's organization and
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
structure an overview of the
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
weatherization process and a discussion
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the program monitoring oversight and
 
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.310 align:start position:0%
of the program monitoring oversight and
expenditures

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
the next section begins on page 13 and
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
contained our observations and
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations related to information
 
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.870 align:start position:0%
recommendations related to information
management

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
in observation number one we found the
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
program could be operated more
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively with an
 
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
information system specifically designed
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
and operated to support the
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
we recommended New Hampshire energy work
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Information
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
Technology to ident to identify the
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
requirements of an information system
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
that will better support the program
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
develop or purchase a system that will
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
meet these unique requirements and
 
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
immediately staff establish a secure
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
method of receiving monthly requests for
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
reimbursements and supporting
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
documentation from Community Action
 
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.890 align:start position:0%
documentation from Community Action
agencies

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
in observation number two on page 15.
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
we recommended New Hampshire energy
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement records management
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
system that will enable the program to
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
organize its records for efficient
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
oversight and program reporting
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
we found the weather's weatherization
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
program was able to report to the U.S
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
department of energy the number of
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
dwelling units were completed for every
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
quarter but it did not track which
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
community community action agencies
 
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:02.220 align:start position:0%
completed the audits
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
we recommended the program track the
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
number of completed dwelling units by
 
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
each Community Action Agency
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
turning to the program operations
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
chapter on page 19
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
observation number four discussed the
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
need for administrative rules
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
we recommended New Hampshire energy
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
consult with the Department of Justice
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
and the official office of legislative
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
services on whether rules are needed for
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of the program being implemented
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
and managed through contracts between
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
the program and Community Action
 
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.890 align:start position:0%
the program and Community Action
agencies

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:34.859 align:start position:0%
observation number five on page 21
 
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
discussed the need for periodic risk
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
assessment and recommended establishing
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
formal written written risk assessments
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
to be used for planning budgeting and
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
implementing program improvements
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
finally observation number six begins on
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
page 22.
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
it discussed the need to keep public
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
information updated on its website
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
during the audit period the program
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
changed its household income eligibility
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
limits yet it did not change information
 
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
in all places on its website
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
the appendices are found in the tab
 
00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:07.619 align:start position:0%

00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
is an item contained within House Bill
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
25 the capital budget we have a request
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
for a data management system that would
 
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
not only cover this program but the
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
existing fuel assistance program as well
 
00:44:43.609 --> 00:44:43.619 align:start position:0%
as the electric assistance program
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
um so that's working its way through
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
um at the process so we expect to speak
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
to the house Public Works colleagues and
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
Senate capital budget Committee in the
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards do you have a
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
order of magnitude cost on that system
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
that database management system
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
so we have gotten initial quotes
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
um back last year during the initial
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
stage of the capital budget process
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at a roughly around
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
eight hundred thousand dollars again in
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
the interim we are looking at just
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
getting updated quotes just to make sure
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
we have the best and latest most
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
up-to-date information especially given
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
inflation a number of other factors
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
involving with software costs over the
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
course of a year
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
but that sort of gives a ballpark of
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the software costs would be for the
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
entire program of not only of the
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program but of
 
00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh the fuel assistance program as well
 
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
thanks for all the help to the people
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
that needed it
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the item
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're going to approve
 
00:45:58.730 --> 00:45:58.740 align:start position:0%
them all in one
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
in one vote
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
what should we move on to next thank you
 
00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:05.099 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
director Smith which we move on to next
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to our management letters
 
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
these are a byproduct of our financial
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
audits for both Lottery and liquor but
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.329 --> 00:46:26.339 align:start position:0%
from our office Kim Bisson she was the
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
senior audit manager on this and joining
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
us I believe is director McIntyre and
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
Jim Durst CFO for from Lottery
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
is Kimberly Bisson and I am a senior
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
audit manager with the LBA division
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
audit division
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
I am here today to present the
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
management letter which is a byproduct
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
of our audit of the Lottery's fiscal
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
year 2022 financial statements which
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
were previously presented to the
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
committee at the January 27th meeting
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the table of contents you
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
will see that the report includes two
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
internal control observations
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
none of which were identified as
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
material weaknesses and it also includes
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
one-state compliance observation
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
the lottery concurs with all three
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
comments and the state compliance
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
observation suggests legislative action
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
may be required
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
observation number one recommends
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
Lottery strengthen its internal control
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
procedures over ilottery Revenue
 
00:47:33.839 --> 00:47:35.390 align:start position:0%
procedures over ilottery Revenue
reconciliations

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
reconciliations
 
00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:37.859 align:start position:0%
we recommend that the lottery review its
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
current Revenue reconciliation
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
procedures and work with the vendor to
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that all relevant data points
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
using the reconciliation are agreed to
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
valid supporting documentation
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
we also recommend that Lottery support
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
its existing reconciliation procedures
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
with a formal management approved policy
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
and procedure document
 
00:47:59.290 --> 00:47:59.300 align:start position:0%
turning to page four
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
observation number two recommends that
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
Lottery Implement procedures to ensure
 
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
that it's gaming system vendor provides
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
routine and timely updates to the
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
listing of individuals used to identify
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
ineligible players as required by game
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
finally the state compliance observation
 
00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
on page six recommends that Lottery
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
continue to take steps towards
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
developing and adopting administrative
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
rules relative to qualifications for
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalties in accordance with
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
statute it also recommends Lottery
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
consult with the Attorney General's
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
office to determine whether a statutory
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
revision is necessary to address
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
conflicting statutory language regarding
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the investigative
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
the appendix located behind the tab on
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
page seven reports the current status as
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
of December 19 2022
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
of the observations contained in the
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Lottery
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
Commission management letters as noted
 
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
on page nine four comments were fully
 
00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
resolved and three were in the process
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
of remediation
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
this conclude concludes my presentation
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank lotteries
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
management and staff for their
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
assistance and cooperation during the
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
audit and with your permission I will
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
now turn the presentation over to
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre for any comments he
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
may have
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman

McIntyre the privilege being director of
 
00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020 align:start position:0%

their hard work and effort on this it's
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
a remarkably collaborative process it
 
00:49:43.849 --> 00:49:43.859 align:start position:0%
has been ongoing since I've been here
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
and certainly before us and so it's a
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
useful exercise and when we don't enjoy
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
but certainly it's worthwhile
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and happy to answer any questions you
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%

committee

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:56.280 align:start position:0%

representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
chair this is probably a question for
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
whoever wrote the report on page seven
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
eight nine there's a status indicator
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
with uh some dots filled in some not I I
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't see a key so I don't know what
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
those status bullets mean
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's on page nine
 
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
oh there's the key yep
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
I guess Lottery still survives as the
 
00:50:45.849 --> 00:50:45.859 align:start position:0%
most audited group in the in the State
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh yes we hold that title many years in
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
a row
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
proudly giving them their own space yet
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
00:51:59.809 --> 00:51:59.819 align:start position:0%
and James Farr is also here from

if you turn to the table of contents
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
you'll note that this report contains

delays encountered while replacing the
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
commission's 35 year old Legacy system
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
mapper with a new system next-gen
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
resulting in a strain on staff resources
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
increased project costs and increase

the commission's Endeavor to replace its
 
00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:22.220 align:start position:0%
mapper system began in fiscal year 2016
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
with an estimated 24-month time frame
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
since then multiple plan go live dates
 
00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:31.559 align:start position:0%
have not been achieved the commission
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
reports the risk of implementing the

next-gen system are currently greater
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
than the risk of continuing operations
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
with its current mapper system until
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
we recommend number one the commission
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%

while continued delays and other issues
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
are resolved with the implementation of
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
the next-gen system
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
and two the commission seek additional
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
resources to fulfill its information
 
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
technology needs to ensure that they are
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
receiving and acting upon the best
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
available advice in the implementation
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%

two
 
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.220 align:start position:0%
we recommend the commission continue to
 
00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:28.859 align:start position:0%
develop a formal and documented risk
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
assessment procedure for recognizing
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
evaluating and responding to risks that
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
could affect its ability to achieve its
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
financial accounting and Reporting
 
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:40.500 align:start position:0%

business operation objectives
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
a similar recommendation was made in the
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
in observation number three on page
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
seven we recommend the commission revamp
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
its current internal audit roles and
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
work towards the implementation of
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
traditional internal audit function that
 
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:07.140 align:start position:0%
performs Audits and focuses on risk
 
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
mitigation and strengthening internal
 
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.609 align:start position:0%
mitigation and strengthening internal
controls

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:10.619 align:start position:0%
controls
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
for the organization
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
the internal audit function should
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
include a formalized process including
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
planned procedures reporting of
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and internal control and
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and recommendations to
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
address the deficiencies noted
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
internal Auditors should have
 
00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate training education and
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
professional background to perform
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
internal audit activities
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
the recommendation was originally
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
reported in the 2019 Liquor Commission
 
00:55:42.490 --> 00:55:42.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
observation number four on page nine our
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
final and state compliance observation
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
recommends the commission comply with
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
statutes Inc the comp and its
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
computation of its transfer to the
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol Abuse Prevention and treatment
 
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.150 align:start position:0%
alcohol Abuse Prevention and treatment
fund

00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
the commission's fiscal year 2022
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
transfer was calculated based on fiscal
 
00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:08.900 align:start position:0%
year 2020's gross profit not fiscal year
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
2021 as statutorily required
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
this resulted in an understatement in
 
00:56:17.809 --> 00:56:17.819 align:start position:0%
the amount transferred of 1.2 million
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2022.
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
if the commission believes its current
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
practice of using audited gross profit
 
00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
from two fiscal years prior is a better
 
00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
alternative to determine its transfer
 
00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
than we recommend it seek statutory
 
00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.309 align:start position:0%
than we recommend it seek statutory
revision

00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
current status of Prior audit findings
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 begin on
 
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
page 11 located behind the tab
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the combined seven comments contained
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
in those reports
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
four are fully resolved and three were
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
in the process of being remediated
 
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
this concludes my presentation I'd like
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
to thank the Liquor Commission for their
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%

and we'd like to thank Jim and his team
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
for the work that they've done I think
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
we're running in competition with
 
00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
lottery for the most audited and happy
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
to have happy to have them there and
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%

that that the committee may have thank
you

00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for a question
 
00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
um certainly I have concerned over
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
observation number one uh started in I
 
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:09.980 align:start position:0%
think it's 16 was what the testimony is
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that that's the bullet that I
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
see in the bottom of page 11.
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
um and I guess you know looking into the
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
budget season uh that's coming up when
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
you'll be in front of Senate Finance I
 
00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
certainly want to know more about this
 
00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:32.819 align:start position:0%
why from 16 to present uh that uh
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen more progress in in
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
replacing that system or what your plan
 
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
of action milestone for this item here
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
on bottom of page 11 is and so that's a
 
00:58:46.609 --> 00:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
heads up for you and for the
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Department in
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
the back that that apparently has some
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
control over the computer systems
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
I he I think he's he's saying that I'm
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not Iraq but we'll we'll find out
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
but that it will be a significant
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
interest item that I have you know when
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
we look into your budget why that
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
particular item is taken as long as it
 
00:59:11.099 --> 00:59:12.770 align:start position:0%
particular item is taken as long as it
has

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you minute uh thank you Mr
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
so I had a couple of questions but I'll
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
go through the chair if that's all right
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
so going to page eight I was kind of
 
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
curious about your response at the
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
bottom of that section where it says the
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
commission will revamp existing internal
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
audit functions as soon as observation
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
one and two can be suitably
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
addressed that seems awful vague to me
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
suitably addressed can you tell me what
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
as chairman Malika indicated my name is
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
James bear I'm director of
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
administration official so uh I worked
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
on this this finding so I certainly can
 
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
talk about it uh clearly so as as we've
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
as you've seen from audit uh
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation number one next-gen is a
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
member project that's been going on for
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
a long period of time now uh represent
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
number two discussed um a position that
 
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
was has now actually been posted I have
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
not had the opportunity to talk to Jim
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
larvier about that so we're we're
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
actually going through a new process now
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
so when I came on board in September
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
I've been the commission for longer than
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
that but in my current position
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
September of last year we had some
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
staffing changes which included a
 
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
position the senior audit analysis
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
position we've now posted that position
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
this is all going to be a new
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
comprehensive view of how all of these
 
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:42.660 align:start position:0%
things work all these things have to
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
work in concert with one I think we all
 
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
could would agree would agree with that
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
all these things have to work in concert
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
with one another so I would not say it's
 
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
vague I would say that this is a a
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
project that's in in full form right so
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
we've now posted the position I'm now in
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
this position we had turnover of my
 
01:00:58.849 --> 01:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
position my current position and also
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
the person who had the position before
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
now I had the opportunity to take a deep
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
dive in how that position was run we
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
want this to now work in concert with
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
we're now going to have a position
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
that's going to look at as we know there
 
01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
was the performance audit that was done
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
on the enforcement division that was the
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
first of the ERM that we that we looked
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
at we're now going to do a comprehensive
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
review of the entire office with this
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
position with audit position coming in
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
but part of that has to also look at how
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
next-gen is going to work NextGen is a
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
fully formed project it's it's from
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
point A to point Z of how the commission
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
runs its business
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
all these things are going to work in
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
concert with one or like I said and part
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
of that is going through all of these
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
things now me being in this position
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
for other question Mr chairman thank you
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I've been on division one for I think
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
eight terms and I have to say that
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
during those eight terms there always
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
seems to be some kind of a delay we have
 
01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:54.020 align:start position:0%
other departments that work with doit
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
things move more smoothly I assume that
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're real I know you're relatively new
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
there but I just want to express my
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
concern as you already heard from
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
Senator gray that he's going to take a
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
bite at your budget coming up but it
 
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
just seems there's always a delay or an
 
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
excuse I'm sorry but that's what I've
 
01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
seen in my years on division one and it
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
it troubles me if I could Mr chairman I
 
01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:24.380 align:start position:0%
go to the alcohol Abuse Prevention
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
calculation there seems to be a
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
disagreement with the Liquor Commission
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
and what statute says and that fund
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
isn't getting properly funded apparently
 
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
based on what I'm reading here so what's
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
that all about so I could I actually
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
have history with that prior to my time
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
being at the New Hampshire Liquor
 
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
Commission I was the drug
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm familiar with how that statute
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
was going to be implemented right if you
 
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:49.740 align:start position:0%
would as you would remember it was never
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
fully funded right well the liquor
 
01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
liquor foam was never fully funded now
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
there was a change of it being funded
 
01:02:58.010 --> 01:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
and how those funds would be would be uh
 
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
put in in a sort of bank right I would
 
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
say that 176.16 there's not a difference
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
in how 170 16 is run it was done during
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
a different different period of time of
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
how the Liquor Commission was supposed
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
to put the money in right week we talked
 
01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
with Das we also talked with the LBA we
 
01:03:16.730 --> 01:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
also talked with
 
01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:20.339 align:start position:0%
um HHS excuse me HHS related of how this
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
should be done we of course do not want
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
to violate any statute that you know
 
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
I've been I've been a lawyer now for
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
many oh shoot I was going to say I would
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
say 18 years actually 20 years uh 20
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
years coming up you know we were
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
certainly in no way shape or form want
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
to violate any statute but in
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
consultation with those three groups we
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that we we want to we
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
want to put the appropriate money in I
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
think we have if if there is concern and
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
there is and we've talked to the the LBA
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
about it we talked about it when
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
actually it was currently being done and
 
01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
now we'll just ask for a statutory roll
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
request a statutory change I think that
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
would then satisfy any concerns I I want
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
to first though say at no point in time
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
have we ever not provided the funding
 
01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
for the alcohol fund we've always done
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
it appropriately the money that was
 
01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
requested to be in there has always made
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
it there so if there's any concerns of
 
01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
it being somehow an excuse of some way
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
shape or form I want to dissuade any of
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
those concerns because I certainly have
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
not seen that in my time at the
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
commission nor would I say that chairman
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
Mullica would have seen that as well
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
now related to the the next gem project
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
we certainly have the people here that
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
can talk about it but I certainly can
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
outline a few of the things that have
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
happened we had a prior vendor Alpha
 
01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
people that did not go through uh we we
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
made the right fiscal decision to end
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
our relationship with them we now have
 
01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:36.059 align:start position:0%
blue horseshoe which is done a
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I apologize I apologize
 
01:04:41.329 --> 01:04:41.339 align:start position:0%
representative so I you know we now are
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
at the point where we further along than
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
ever before we certainly did not
 
01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
anticipate a pandemic occurring we also
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
have had updates that are required
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
updates from Microsoft we've also had
 
01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
you know and I think dot would I know
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
they would agree with this we had
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges it's related to doit
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know we've had things that certainly
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
were no fault of the liquor commissions
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
that ended up being you know a delay and
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
I think they're I think the team here
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
today would say this unequivocally there
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
is no group that wants this project to
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
be up and running more than us
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
and I think I I would say with with uh
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
some level of assurance that we
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
anticipate fiscal year
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
2024 that the project will be up and
 
01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:21.950 align:start position:0%
2024 that the project will be up and
running

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
running
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
I just want to add representative the
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
caveat has always been
 
01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
the risk the risk versus the reward do
 
01:05:31.609 --> 01:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
we really want to put the revenue of the
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission at risk to to be on
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
time with a project that could possibly
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
be faulty the answer to me is no the the
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
revenue that we create every year is
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
essential to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
and this old system that we have is a
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
working system do we go with a new
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
system when we're not 100 sure of it in
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
my mind we don't and that's one of the
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
one of the cautionary tales that we've
 
01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
always been through with this we've
 
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
we've been pressured to launch and we
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
aren't going to launch until we can
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
assure everyone
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you hi
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner and Mr rare it's really
 
01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I have a few questions if I could so
 
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
going back to what Senator gray started
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
on the next-gen system am I reading
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
correctly on page four that we've
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
already put 20 million into this
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
what is the full
 
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
when it's finally running I mean are we
 
01:06:58.010 --> 01:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
yes feel free to use that Mike
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
April bunker is the project manager
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
Senator she can answer that question for
 
01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:07.609 align:start position:0%
Senator she can answer that question for
you

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
so we are as as director Vera said we're
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
farther along than we've ever been we're
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
now talking about support post go live
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about performance testing
 
01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
um although the processes are working
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
that they can handle the sales volume
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
that we have and and the the volume of
 
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
of you know product movement that we we
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
have at the commission and again as he
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
said this this touches every piece of
 
01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
our business from A to Z
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
it has unfortunately cost us more money
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
simply because we've had the failed
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
vendor for the three years we are
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
feeling like we're Incredibly Close we
 
01:07:50.289 --> 01:07:50.299 align:start position:0%
do anticipate one additional Amendment
 
01:07:53.809 --> 01:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
which will require additional funding
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
but um we're almost there
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
can I follow up thank you so
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll be hearing how much that
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
additional funding is but on the
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
transfer to the Alcohol and Other Drug
 
01:08:08.579 --> 01:08:09.890 align:start position:0%
transfer to the Alcohol and Other Drug
fund

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
if we're missing 1.2 million is the
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
commission going to be transferring that
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year or next fiscal year and
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
when you say you're seeking revision of
 
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.269 align:start position:0%
when you say you're seeking revision of
RSA

01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
17616 are you doing that in-house Bill
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
too we have not really we have not asked
 
01:08:32.749 --> 01:08:32.759 align:start position:0%
for a statutory change at this point
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
obviously this happened you know fairly
 
01:08:36.289 --> 01:08:36.299 align:start position:0%
recently of when we're here in that
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
audit uh finding we certainly could you
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
know I don't think there is any harm to
 
01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:42.980 align:start position:0%
that well we concur so be in touch yeah
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
but will you be transferring that money
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
when that's our understanding that we
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
would be the CFO would certainly be
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
better equipped to answer that but I
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
there's no we will be we will be putting
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
the money into the fund
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
as we have as we had previously had
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's no question that we will be
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
the other because there's not 1.2
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
million missing it's just times of when
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
it has been put in
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:09:15.769 --> 01:09:15.779 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question so
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh this is just to address Senator
 
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's issue just so you know that
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
for the uh 24 25 budget the division
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
three is just done with now we we did
 
01:09:31.329 --> 01:09:31.339 align:start position:0%
increase on an HP one item with some HD
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
hb2 language uh the the full amount of
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
money to make up the five percent so so
 
01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:42.140 align:start position:0%
we've I think in the future
 
01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:50.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative erf for a question
 
01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
so I had previously read your the very
 
01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
last paragraph on page 10. and it's I
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
guess maybe I'm interpreting it
 
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
differently but it seems to imply that
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
your change is going to
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
change legislative change the legis
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
change the law to match what you're
 
01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.189 align:start position:0%
change the law to match what you're
doing

01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
is that a misunderstanding or misreading
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
of that it would change it to how we are
 
01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
currently doing with advice from Das HHS
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
as well as LBA so with that
 
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
understanding wouldn't that mean you're
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
not going to transfer
 
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
the one whatever it is that amount
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
because your current understanding as I
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
read this implies that that would not
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
have been that would not be transferred
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
oh it would be transferred obviously the
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
statutory change would have to happen
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
after that would be transferred it would
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay so in the video
 
01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up so I think what I just
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
showed you say is you'll transfer that
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it is but
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
after a legislative change when we get
 
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
to the next time you do this you're
 
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
going to do it the way that you're
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
you've been doing it so you wouldn't
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
have transferred those funds is that
 
01:10:57.179 --> 01:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
have transferred those funds is that
accurate

01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a hypothetical that we're
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
sort of is not the funds will be
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
transferred as required by Statute we
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
will ensure that that
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
flooding mandate happens I understand
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that's not my question are you Chan
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
are you playing so you say you're gonna
 
01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
you're in a legislative change I'm
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
understood that correctly right yes okay
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
are you changing it such that
 
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
the effect would be to
 
01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
pay based on the current year not two
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
years prior or are you changing it so
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
it'll be based on the two years prior
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
we haven't even gone that far yet we
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
certainly would would ask for any any
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
input we would certainly work with the
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
LBA on that as well uh you know my what
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
is here you know I I would venture to
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
say that we would be paying it as we've
 
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
currently been paying it okay I I just
 
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
currently been paying it okay I I just
think

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenwald's point it doesn't
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
sound like your verbiage is expressing
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
that in that last paragraph there
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize for any misinterpretation
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we would certainly continue to
 
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
follow bang as we're required to
 
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.729 align:start position:0%
follow bang as we're required to
Mike

01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane sure and and we'll continue to
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
work with the legislature throughout the
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
budget process it really is a timing
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
issue of what information is available
 
01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
and what the Liquor Commission is
 
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.850 align:start position:0%
and what the Liquor Commission is
statutorily

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:14.570 align:start position:0%
statutorily
um

01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
required to do versus the actual timing
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
of a fiscal year because as you know we
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
just got a presentation of fiscal year
 
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
just got a presentation of fiscal year
22

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
22
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
um on the actual kafir and so that's
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
what they'd have to use but they don't
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
have to they won't be able to know that
 
01:12:30.890 --> 01:12:30.900 align:start position:0%
figure until you're doing your budget
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
for 24. so it's that two-year lag it's
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
the very stringent requirement and
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
statute right now to use the kafir
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
figures but I'm sure that as we go
 
01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
through the process with the legislature
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
uh working with the Liquor Commission
 
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
and we could probably come up with
 
01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.570 align:start position:0%
and we could probably come up with
something

01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
representative leishman did you want to
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
add something yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess just to direct address the
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
Chairman's comment about raising money
 
01:12:59.090 --> 01:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
and you don't want that anything to get
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
in the way of raising money but I just
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
want to say we want to make sure
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
everything is is as transparent as
 
01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
possible and I want to read something
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned I think Senator Greg
 
01:13:14.209 --> 01:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
gray rather about the budget
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um you just one of you just said that
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get this next-gen
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
system up and running you've had some
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
issues with it what division one did
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
is uh the Liquor Commission came before
 
01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:29.699 align:start position:0%
us for some additional priorities
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
and we provided a supported 1.9 million
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
dollars for next gen for 24.
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
and 1.5 million for 25.
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
and this is for and let me read it here
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance and support of the next gen
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
system so I'm kind of concerned when you
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
say you're having trouble getting it up
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
and things haven't worked out but you're
 
01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
asking for millions of dollars for the
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
maintenance and continued support of the
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
system in your prioritized request so I
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
just hope the Senate takes a good look
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
at this as well because I just as I said
 
01:14:09.229 --> 01:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
earlier I've had concerns for years
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
well I can assure you representative
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing that's not
 
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
transparent at The Liquor Commission
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've been audited every year and our
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
audit findings have been have turned
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
into a minimalistic audit findings with
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
all due respect and we work very hard to
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
that the revenue to this state is safe
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
and sound and one of the concerns with
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
launching next-gen prior to it being
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
ready is the concern of the revenue and
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
the revenues that you're speaking to in
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
the budget that we've asked for are for
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
one once the uh program is launched we
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
understand that every program such as uh
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
administrative service is doing now with
 
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:04.739 align:start position:0%
they've asked for 20 million dollars to
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
upgrade their system Microsoft changes
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
these systems as you go along and these
 
01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:11.300 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs and upgrades have to
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
happen we've been running with a system
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
that was homemade
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
for 35 or 40 years and has cost the
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
state nothing other than the employees
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
that ran it and what we're moving to is
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
a complete cloud-based system and those
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
cloud-based systems have licenses and
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
they have they have expeditious spending
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
that has to take place in order to keep
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
them current and that will be an ongoing
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
thing from from this point forward from
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
when next-gen launches that the state
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
will have to incur
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
I I just don't want to be argumentative
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman but I'm just reading from
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
their prioritized lists and it's for the
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance and continued support of the
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
as we heard earlier from the project
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
manager it's it's a it's in progress and
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
obviously the
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
the big thing and we see a lot of the
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
theft through the cloud of many banks
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
and many financial institutions and I I
 
01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:24.900 align:start position:0%
support your caution
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
because someone would love to steal a
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
few million right out of it so
 
01:16:32.990 --> 01:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Senator gray thank you just a final
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
comment from me I guess you know if I
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
look at representative leishman and
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
myself and some of the others you know a
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
detailed plan of action milestones and
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
how you are accomplishing those will
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of our questions okay and
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
that is one of the things that you know
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
I expect to see you know when we're
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
doing the budget and when we're talking
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
about this particular item so you know
 
01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.450 align:start position:0%
about this particular item so you know
that's

01:16:59.450 --> 01:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that I'm interested in
 
01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll answer you know the
 
01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:05.780 align:start position:0%
representatives questions my questions
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and we will either provide the oversight
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
or have doit provide the oversight of
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know the things that are going on
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
there and try to help you along to get
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
it up and running and and working for
 
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.270 align:start position:0%
it up and running and and working for
everyone

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
we have a timeline right here Senator
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we'd be happy to pass out and this
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
project is has been done from the
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
beginning in concert with Das doit and
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
the department of safety Rick Bailey
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
Charlie is on our board Dennis is on our
 
01:17:42.169 --> 01:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
board as well as myself and others
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
did the project manager want to add
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
anything I did want to just stress that
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
we have gone live with certain pieces of
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
the next-gen system which was the second
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the LBA in the in the
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
report we have gone live with a very
 
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
profitable b2c
 
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
program that was part of this this
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
initial next-gen project that was split
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
apart from the Dynamics Microsoft
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
Dynamics project when the first vendor
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
failed so anything that can be
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
implemented we've implemented electronic
 
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
sales tags which saves labor costs in
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
our stores we've implemented EMV
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
compliant or the chip compliant pin pads
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
all of our stores have the new Hardware
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
in them so there are many pieces of the
 
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
next gen project that have gone live I
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that we're
 
01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:35.219 align:start position:0%
stressing that that we have done done
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
that and and we anticipate that Dynamics
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to go live in the
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
very near future thank you Senator gray
 
01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
if you'd get on my calendar call Debbie
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
and whoever else in the department you
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
want to take with you I would be
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
interested in in what the expansion of
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
this this last block which is on your
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
plan of action Milestones is so that I
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
can understand that because it's
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
certainly not detailed enough for me to
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
do anything more with than just say well
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
gee Yep they're working on it so I
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
we've already had a motion to accept the
 
01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:18.659 align:start position:0%
reports place them on file and release
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
in the usual manner are you ready for
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no further question
 
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%

01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%

01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
Mr Kane
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
if you have anything else to add nothing
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
else to add just the day to the next
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the third Friday in April is
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
um we'll be in a much easier position in
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
this in the house but I know the Senate
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
will be busy any restrictions on when
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:36.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
certainly the the schedule right now
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
um isn't cast in concrete and that if I
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
need to to carve out a couple of hours
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
for fiscal uh we will certainly do that
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
so we have nothing in the morning why
 
01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:53.219 align:start position:0%
don't we go back to our normal morning
 
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
we could do it in the morning if it if
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
it works for us sounds sounds good to me
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
how early
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
