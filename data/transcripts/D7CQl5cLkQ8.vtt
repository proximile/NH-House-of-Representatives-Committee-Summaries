governor's budget director matt malou
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
matt do you have anything else you want
 
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
to say on this i think we covered it
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
when you were here before
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
very well but one last chance the only
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
thing i think there was one more date
 
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
that was in this amendment at the very
 
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.710 align:start position:0%
that was in this amendment at the very
end

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that it needed to
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
change but i believe there was
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point that out um i don't
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see any date on page 9 either
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
matt you want uh
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
mike i don't know which page this would
 
00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
be on the amendment but there were two
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
dates that we discussed last time on
 
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.350 align:start position:0%
dates that we discussed last time on
when

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
it needed to take effect and they were
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
out they were not synchronized
 
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure and again
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
only one of them needed to change which
 
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
is probably why we see the amendment the
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
way it is but just wanted to make sure
 
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.629 align:start position:0%
way it is but just wanted to make sure
that

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%

the old amendment yeah i had only um
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
right only one thing only one date
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be changed
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
so i believe we're good but it just
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to confirm that
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to leave my amendment with you
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
and as
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
mrs lavines told us earlier we can do a
 
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.430 align:start position:0%
mrs lavines told us earlier we can do a
rat

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
rat
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
if it comes to that at the end but
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to double check that
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
okay any discussions on the changes to
 
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%

microphone on
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
he's going to do it again because one
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
cannot hear without mics on
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%

then i would like next to turn
 
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
then i would like next to turn
to

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.589 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
an amendment that represent walls and
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
mr malou worked on together this is the
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.749 align:start position:0%
 
20210917h

00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
20210917h
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
you want to go through section by
 
00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
you want to go through section by
section

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i think what we'll do is we'll go
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
through the whole amendment section by
 
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.070 align:start position:0%
through the whole amendment section by
section

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
and then have questions so matt if i
 
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.749 align:start position:0%
and then have questions so matt if i
could

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
get you to walk us through this as you
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
and represent walls worked on this
 
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.950 align:start position:0%
and represent walls worked on this
together

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative i'll start on
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
page one line one
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
deletes section 143 of the bill
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
this was uh something we've talked about
 
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.230 align:start position:0%
this was uh something we've talked about
previously

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
the language was for the current
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
biennium and
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately didn't need to be included
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
i think there's a change on lines six
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
and seven as well
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the next part of this
 
00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:03.110 align:start position:0%
uh yes so the next part of this
amendment

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
which deals with section 191 of the bill
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
simply renames the divisions so that
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
they are the same
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
titles everywhere that they appear there
 
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
titles everywhere that they appear there
was

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
a incongruency um in one area
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
this just brings everything into
 
00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:20.829 align:start position:0%
this just brings everything into
alignment

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
alignment
 
00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:23.910 align:start position:0%
alignment
okay

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh lines eleven through sixteen are new
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
this section is amended i'm not i'm
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
sorry when i say new i mean amended
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
different language than what we've seen
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes and this we coordinated with the
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services to
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
get the language
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
exactly the way that they would like to
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
see it it gives
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the new department at the authority
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
conditional on approval of governor and
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
council and the director of personnel
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
ability to move positions equipment or
 
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.389 align:start position:0%
ability to move positions equipment or
appropriations

00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
to create the proper expenditure lines
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
if needed this is something that's been
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
included in past reorganizations of
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
state government
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's a catch-all if you will
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay line 21 we've added any public
 
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
okay line 21 we've added any public
utility

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh any public utility was existing we've
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
added or
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
entities subject to its jurisdiction
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
given that some
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
are not classified as public utilities
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
but do fall under this section
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay well we have a date change on line
 
00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:26.389 align:start position:0%
okay well we have a date change on line
27

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
27
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes this brings the language in hb2
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
into consistency with the appropriations
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
in hb1
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
for the full biennium and then starting
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page 1
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
line 29 we're going to have a new
 
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.150 align:start position:0%
line 29 we're going to have a new
section

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
that is correct this addresses page two
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
this addresses that initial period of 60
 
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:49.910 align:start position:0%
this addresses that initial period of 60
days

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
while the commissioner would go through
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
the governor and council
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
confirmation process this gives the
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
governor the authority to designate an
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
interim commissioner
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
until gnc has taken action
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay and then on page two line seven we
 
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy unclassified
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
positions established
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
the change here is the director of
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
has been removed from this list which
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
would be a classified role as opposed to
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
an unclassified
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
position okay we go to line 28
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
this is a correcting
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
the reference uh currently in hb2
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
was directed to the commission but this
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
authority would exist with department of
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
energy okay
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
and down to line 36 line 36
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
this replaces section 227 which deals
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
with the site evaluation committee
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
the membership of which no longer has
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
any changes whatsoever
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
the only change we're making is the
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy okay
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
page three line twelve page three
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
line twelve again this corrects the
 
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.470 align:start position:0%
line twelve again this corrects the
references

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
from commission to the department of
 
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.030 align:start position:0%
from commission to the department of
energy

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
and down to page three uh line 35
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
we immense we deleted a section yes
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
this authority would stay with the
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission so there is
 
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission so there is
no

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
could we go through all of this and then
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
hold your questions
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then we'll i will back up as far as
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
you want to back up
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind just so we get through
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
the changes
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
line two page four this clarifies that
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
this authority
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
is shared between the commission and the
 
00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.550 align:start position:0%
is shared between the commission and the
department

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh and that's the change that you see on
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
line three
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
all right and then line ten line
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
10 this section is clarifying
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
again shared authority between the
 
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:12.949 align:start position:0%
again shared authority between the
commission

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy we go to
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page four we have line 35
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
and 36
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
this change is in line 35 and 36
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
it clarifies that the commission has the
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
obligation to disallow payment if
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
recommended by the department
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
just clarifying who has that authority
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to turn to page five
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
and we're on the end of line six and
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
just line
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
seven this corrects the
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh legal action the department would not
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
issue orders they would issue rules
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
the first version corrected the
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
reference but didn't correct the type of
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
action that they would take okay line 10
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
this changes commission to department in
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
each instance
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
line 20 the only change is the very last
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
line 33 changing commission to the
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
department where these entities should
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
register with
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to turn to page six
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
line 11 which is going to
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
line 11 is alliance 23
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
to 28 it removes the instances where
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
approval of the general court would not
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
be required to increase the system's
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
benefits charge
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
why did you remove that so the general
 
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.829 align:start position:0%
why did you remove that so the general
court

00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee would need to
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
approve all changes in any instance
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
that removes this exception that was
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
carved in
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
to restore the full authority of the
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to turn we're not going
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
to debate we're going to go through all
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
the changes we'll go back
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
this clarifies which and which regional
 
00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.829 align:start position:0%
this clarifies which and which regional
entities

00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
entities
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
each the both the department
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the commission have authority to
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
engage with um these were co-mingled
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
we've separated those out based on where
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to turn to page
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
eight and we go to
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
line 19 which is going to amend a
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
section following
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
this this section
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
puts everything back to current law the
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
initial proposal could have been
 
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.389 align:start position:0%
initial proposal could have been
construed

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
construed
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
to force an ongoing proceeding to
 
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.710 align:start position:0%
to force an ongoing proceeding to
restart

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
restart
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
our intention is not to force a process
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
to start from scratch
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
so we've removed any change directing
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
the department of energy to
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
create a new process but continue to use
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
the existing one
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay line 33 addresses the section
 
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.389 align:start position:0%
okay line 33 addresses the section
following

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
this is a new section that was not in
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 2
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
but the only change here is changing
 
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.590 align:start position:0%
but the only change here is changing
references

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
from the commission to the department of
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.069 align:start position:0%
from the commission to the department of
energy

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
all right and to representative
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
leishman's concerns last time we spoke
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
department is a defined term that's des
 
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
we've specifically spelled out
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
environmental services each time it
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
should appear
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
all right the last change we have before
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
we open the floor to questions is
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
page 10 the effective date was changed
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
to july 1st 2021 correct
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that's consistent
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
with the appropriations in hb1
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
all right representative lischmann you
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
had the first question so i want to go
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
back to you go back to wherever you'd
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
like to be sir
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at hb2
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
21 membership and i think
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
i have a note here that you raised a
 
00:17:43.039 --> 00:17:48.870 align:start position:0%
i have a note here that you raised a
question

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah well now they want to go back to
 
00:17:51.909 --> 00:17:51.919 align:start position:0%
nine and they're giving up
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
g madam chair we're having
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
trouble hearing representative leishman
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
oh well we have a microphone little
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
issue i think we just solved with a once
 
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.789 align:start position:0%
issue i think we just solved with a once
button

00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
button
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps all right
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
those pesky on buttons what can i say
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
good morning mr hatch
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
okay so peter on line 36 what they
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
are agreeing to do is leaving it at nine
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
members um
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
the osi is i understand this osi didn't
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
really have
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
a seat before and so you've agreed this
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
we don't need this is that correct matt
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay i just wanted to
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
make sure it was clear thank you
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's all i have okay matt i'd like to
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
and can we talk a little bit more about
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
this strikeout what we've
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing to strike out is
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
the requirement of prior approval
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire general court shall
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to approve that it does
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
not say fiscal can
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
if you've put that out so there's
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of history here the
 
00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:19.590 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of history here the
intention

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
intention
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
is to return the authority the general
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
court to approve
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
all increases in the system's benefits
 
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:26.549 align:start position:0%
all increases in the system's benefits
charge

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
but where is that written in here that
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
what we've removed are these certain
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
instances where the general court did
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
not need to be consulted
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
okay now we see that when we went
 
00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.230 align:start position:0%
okay now we see that when we went
through

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
and you did exactly what i did you asked
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
to you concentrated on the changes so i
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
here i assume that since your name is on
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
this you're completely in favor of the
 
00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:03.830 align:start position:0%
this you're completely in favor of the
changes

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
my name is on this because
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
and matt malou were working on it and
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the chair gets
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
the is the target for the person who's
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
going to have their name on it
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
i really had they worked independently
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
without me
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
i had nothing to do with this i didn't
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
see it until you guys got it either
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
so it is what it is
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes you represent walls
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't see your hand raised is did you
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't i'm sorry okay all right i just
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if i was overlooking you
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
i apologize if i was
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
let's just plan to enter the
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
conversation i just want to say this is
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of changes in here that go
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
beyond what i talked about with matt i
 
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
beyond what i talked about with matt i
don't

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
object to them but i just wanna
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
some of the changes i proposed are in
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
here a lot of the changes were not
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily my proposal and honestly the
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
first time i have seen this amendment is
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
so i think i said you and matt worked on
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
it together
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
and then peter asked why my name was on
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
it and i said because somebody had to be
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
the target
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
so even though i left you guys working
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
on it when we left last i was fine with
 
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.990 align:start position:0%
on it when we left last i was fine with
that

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
and matt was already doing work on it
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
you wanted to work with him so
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
i'm perfectly happy with that in fact my
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
name ended up on it not a problem
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
that's fine i just didn't want to be
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
claiming an amendment that
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
literally i hadn't seen and i didn't
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
have input on a lot of the changes
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representation
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh thanks venom chair as the cheer knows
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
torn one way or the other to go with
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
this and
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh i did receive an email
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
um from the past chair
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
bob backus of the science and technology
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
committee which
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
leads me to a question for matt
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh let's get some background
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think if you mute yourself in the
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
interim and turn off
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
do you have on your do you have your
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
phone as well as your computer
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
yeah my computer i can't see anything
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
never mind
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's okay what you need to do bill
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
is move your speaker your sound
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
to zero and use the phone you'll be fine
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
so man i guess the question i have for
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
you bob mentioned that
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
you had actually made the motion during
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
this commission study
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
to create the department of energy that
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
you suggested the matter needed further
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
study so
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
what brought you around from your motion
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
to further study this to now completely
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
support it
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i think ultimately this issue
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
that was before the study commission was
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
a broader scope right there was
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
consideration to bring components from
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
in as well and groups like department of
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural resources were part
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
of those conversations it was really a
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
broad scope of that study
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
broader than what we've put forward so
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
now that we've been able to
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
look at the good work that commission
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
did and identify
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
some of these areas for collaboration uh
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
when i was with the office of strategic
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives this is a proposal we could
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
have supported
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
had the committee or have the study
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
commission gone in that direction
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
but again there there seemed to be a
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
much wider scope
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
and a broader reorganization than what
 
00:23:53.919 --> 00:23:54.310 align:start position:0%
and a broader reorganization than what
we

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
see no additional discussion i think
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
is your mic on i guess i didn't move it
 
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.430 align:start position:0%
is your mic on i guess i didn't move it
yet

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
second representative emerick moves the
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
adoption of two zero two one zero nine
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
one seven eight
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative griffin seconds it
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
see no discussion on the motion if the
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
clerk could call the rule
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
madam chairman yes vice chairman yes the
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative griffin yes
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
it appears he's trying to vote no he's
 
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.710 align:start position:0%
it appears he's trying to vote no he's
gone

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
gone
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't get uh representative hatch
 
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.350 align:start position:0%
i didn't get uh representative hatch
disconnected

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
disconnected
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh the vote is six to nothing with
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative hatch disconnected from
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.789 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to walk
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%

it's a slow process matt you got all the
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%

matt

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
matt
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's up excellent this
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
is a technical correction when we were
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
moving this one individual position it's
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
position number 14373
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
it was only moved in one
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium so it would have
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
moved within the department
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
in year two that's not the intention
 
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
in year two that's not the intention
this

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
increase here is directly
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
offset by the decrease
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
in accounting unit 1889. so this is a
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
technical correction
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
on the movement of position one four
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
three seven
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
three to a you one
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
eight eight seven and you won it for
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
both years and it was one year
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct so it again we're just
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
moving where it's budgeted but the
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
total amount budgeted does not change
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
any questions for the governor's budget
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
director on this
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
errata change representative walls
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
what is the position it's a number but
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it has a title beyond that
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
this position deals with wholesale
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
electricity issues
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's a direct report to another
 
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:12.630 align:start position:0%
uh it's a direct report to another
position

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
that position properly existed in the
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
same spot both years
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
and this again just brings it into
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
conformity within the division of policy
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
and programs
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you i would move this amendment
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%

the number is 20210827h

interrupt um
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
the previous amendment was a page one of
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
four oh we have to do all of them um
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
okay so matt do you have
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman i guess we'll look at page
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
two before we look at the amendment i
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
just called out
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm sharing that
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
but i can't i think you are
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment is the other half of the
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
technical correction
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
which you see in fy 23 there's a
 
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.190 align:start position:0%
which you see in fy 23 there's a
decrease

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing that is happening
 
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.389 align:start position:0%

simultaneously

00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%

the representative walls
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
as well as others to refund this
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
position which deals with regulatory
 
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.830 align:start position:0%

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
and strategy representative walls this
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
is one of the positions that that you
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
had mentioned
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
represented walls would you like to
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
comment i just want to understand which
 
00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.350 align:start position:0%
comment i just want to understand which
position

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
in this form it's hard for me to tell
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
position number 14358
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
which was the regulatory innovation and
 
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.710 align:start position:0%
which was the regulatory innovation and
strategy

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
do you have a comment represent walls
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
you'd like you want to make
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
i do not at this point there were well
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay except i will say generally there
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
were a number of positions that were put
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
that were really puc functions and i
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
tried to move them back
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
i misunderstood and thought that none of
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
them were going to get moved back
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm pleasantly surprised to see this
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
so let me just clarify representative
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
this position
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
was unfunded we're now refunding it
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
but it is in the department of energy
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
not the puc this is separate from those
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
other positions that you had requested
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative leishman moves the

nothing madam german
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay so mike having made that mistake
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
once let's turn to page three if you can
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
go down a page we'll continue
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
now that you got us back on the right
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
path and this is another technical
 
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.389 align:start position:0%
path and this is another technical
correction

00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
correction
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
move position number nw065
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
to accounting unit 1891
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
from accounting unit 1891 to 1888
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
and position 18945
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
from accounting unit 1888 to 1891. it
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
looks like we're swapping positions in
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
two places matt you're on
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh nw065
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
is an i.t position that is best
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
situated in accounting unit 1888
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
which i believe is the support division
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
but i can grab that page of the budget
 
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
um conversely position
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
18945 is moving in the opposite
 
00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:06.149 align:start position:0%
18945 is moving in the opposite
direction

00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
which is why the number the overall
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
for the it position it made sense based
 
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
for the it position it made sense based
on

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
the functions of the division that it
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%

00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
um i i'd have to look and see exactly
 
00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:36.710 align:start position:0%
um i i'd have to look and see exactly
which

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
griffin yes representative leishman
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
yes representative hatch yes
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
yes does that have been nothing you know
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:20.069 align:start position:0%
yes does that have been nothing you know
okay

00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that brings us to page four
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
which mr hoffman will bring up on the
 
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.629 align:start position:0%
which mr hoffman will bring up on the
screen

00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
and this is the corollary to those two
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
movements isn't it matt the i.t
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
position and the other one that is
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
correct although i believe
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
class 60 should be a
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a positive mine says
 
00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:52.790 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a positive mine says
negative

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
negative
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
oh well okay then then yes we were all
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
set then
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes i must have a slightly older version
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
but the numbers on the screen are
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
correct yes that
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
okay numbers on the screen are correct
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
numbers those are the numbers i got this
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
morning for mr hoffman so we're in good
 
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
morning for mr hoffman so we're in good
shape

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves the
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
adoption representative griffin seconds
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh madam chairman yes vice chairman yes
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk folks yes
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative griffin yeah fair
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
president leashman yeah representative
 
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:25.750 align:start position:0%
president leashman yeah representative
hatch

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative walsh yes seven
 
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
nothing unanimous unanimously
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay now i think we're done with that
 
00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay now i think we're done with that
one

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to look at some
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
abolished positions
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
so this is amendment 2 0
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
2 1 0 8
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
and when mr hoffman brings it up we'll
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
excuse madam chairman could you is that
 
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.349 align:start position:0%
excuse madam chairman could you is that
zero

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
eight two seven h looks like this i just
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
is that visible now it is thank you
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay man you're on the change here is in
 
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
okay man you're on the change here is in
line

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
eight these are two vacant positions
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
that do not need to exist after this
 
00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.670 align:start position:0%
that do not need to exist after this
reorganization

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
so uh they're one of them is an
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
administrative secretary that's
 
00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:58.390 align:start position:0%
administrative secretary that's
duplicative

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
under the new structure um that comes
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
from osi the other one is one
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
at the puc um
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
is a similar situation to vacant
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
position that doesn't need to exist
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
in the new structure this helps address
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
some of those double budgeting concerns
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the committee had raised
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
during our first presentation questions
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious about how a department
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
of health and human services
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
position ended up in the same amendment
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
that's existing
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the same exception of hb2 so this is
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything that's in section 7
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
of hb from hp1 so there's no changes to
 
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.349 align:start position:0%
of hb from hp1 so there's no changes to
hhs

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
hhs
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's in hp2s it is okay the
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
mr hoffman is there any chance that
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
is doing anything with that hhs person
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
um there is a chance
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
but we look at all of these house bill 1
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
sections together
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process to make sure
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
step on each other's toes so to speak
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay if you could uh just make mr ripple
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
aware this that we're doing only the
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
energy ones
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
and the hhs one is whatever he wants to
 
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:31.670 align:start position:0%
and the hhs one is whatever he wants to
do

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay represent walsh you have your
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
i do thank you um i just want to check
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
with matt and make sure that
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
before i vote yes on this that none of
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
these the things i'm trying to restore i
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to contradict myself and i
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
just can't tell from looking at these
 
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.589 align:start position:0%
just can't tell from looking at these
numbers

00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
not the two in 2021 the second part of
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
this amendment madam chair if you'd like
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
to go through that as well
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
is an additional abolish position 9u573
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
this is an unclassified position
 
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
that would become a classified role in
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
the new structure
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
given that there's now a unclassified
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
division director
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
for the enforcement division it doesn't
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
make sense to have a second unclassified
 
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
make sense to have a second unclassified
position

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the duties of this job are maintained
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
but in a classified role so if i may
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair yes please do
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand when this is is
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
this the director of safety and security
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct um and i know
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative walls here have a
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
proposal to break this off into its own
 
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.710 align:start position:0%
proposal to break this off into its own
division

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
which would preserve an unclassified
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
director over
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
it either if the if the committee was to
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of that
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to have an
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
unclassified director over that division
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
but it does not in our opinion make
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
sense to have
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
an unclassified um that's
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it it's essentially it's a
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
role that could become classified into
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
the new structure
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
well given that it's undercutting one of
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
the amendments i'm about to present
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support this then i
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
would i have no problem with the first
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
half but i'm not going to undercut
 
00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
half but i'm not going to undercut
myself

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative emerick
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
moves the adoption of this amendment
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative griffin seconds
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
when you're ready you may call the role
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
sir clerk
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%

walls
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
no uh five to nothing five to two
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
all right a little another stack of
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
matt you must have been busy over the
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
weekend because mike hoffman brought up
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
a wheelbarrow full of paper this morning
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:20.069 align:start position:0%
 
those

00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
all right mr hoffman we're looking at
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
administrative support governor's page
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
361 hb1 amendment and it's about
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh transfers to doit i think this is
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
all of the it money into one place but
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
or he can ask you to talk about if he's
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh mike is this one of the amendments
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that we brought forward i believe
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
we've addressed all of the governor's
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
office requested amendments
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
this was a suggestion to consolidate all
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
of the class 27
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
and it's a seven page
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment which just shows the class 27
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
amounts being reduced in
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
other accounting units and
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
combined into 1891 administrative
 
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.589 align:start position:0%
combined into 1891 administrative
support

00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
this this is assuming all seven pages
 
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
are just
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
offsetting what we see here uh this
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
probably is an outgrowth of the
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
conversations we've had with doit
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
that we do that the money is correct
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
but there may be better ways to cost
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
allocated across funding streams
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
i don't have any opposition to this
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
reorganization of where class 27s exist
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
but there may be additional action in
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
to put money at the puc specifically
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
but to the extent that we're just
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
reorganizing class lines there's
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
authority in hb2 as well
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
for das to work with the department to
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
address this as well
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
as long as we're addressing the right
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
money it shouldn't be an
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
issue because the department can also
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
per state law come to fiscal committee
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
request the establishment of a line item
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
and the transfer of the funds so there
 
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.270 align:start position:0%
and the transfer of the funds so there
are

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
multiple ways to make sure the money
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
gets in the right place especially with
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
the new department
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes mr hoffman can we vote all these
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
with one motion yes there are they're
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
all part of one action
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
the very last page is the
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
doit adjustment that
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
we we worked with the department of
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
information technology to make sure that
 
00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:55.839 align:start position:0%
we're putting the correct amount
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
in that it for energy account
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
one motion would adopt the doit
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
reorganization of the money so moved

no i don't think this is yours this is
mine

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
mine
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
but you're off the hook matt
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh mike would you bring up the
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
unfunding of the vacant unclassified
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
administrator position
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
this position is currently vacant
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
and this unfunds it but does not abolish
 
00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:23.109 align:start position:0%
and this unfunds it but does not abolish
it

00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
for the coming year it's been vacant for
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
quite a while they're not even reaching
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
out to higher and now we're reorganizing
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
the entire situation over there
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
so it gives us a
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
cut of about 250 000
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the budget representative emerick
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%

um the amendments that represent walls
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
had prepared i will
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
after i get them up on the screen i will
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
have her speak to each one
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to start mike with the
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
mercury analyzer
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
position or equipment
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
mary beth when it comes up on the screen
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
yeah there we go if you'd like to walk
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
us through your amendment
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to so there's sort of a sad
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
story that goes with this and that is
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
last thur susan carlson who's the ceo of
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
the department of environmental services
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
is one of my neighbors and has been for
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
over 20 years we've known each other a
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
long time
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we have a tight neighborhood and
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
last thursday morning i got a call that
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
her husband had died that morning
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
so i immediately picked up the phone
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
called her and said sue what can i do
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
and she we talked for a couple minutes
 
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
about peter and then she immediately
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
turned the conversation to this and she
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
said there's
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
one thing i desperately need i need this
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
mercury analyzer
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i said how much and she told me
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
about 55 000 i'm like
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
we can do that i will try that so that
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
is the story behind this amendment
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
um is that literally her husband wasn't
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
cold yet and she's begging me for a
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
mercury analyzer
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i thought this is pretty serious if
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's the one thing she can think of
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
in the midst of this pretty overwhelming
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
grief so
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
i brought the amendment in that this is
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
one thing that apparently the department
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
really needs it's a relatively small
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the money is there somewhere
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
and so i brought the amendment
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
well while i appreciate that i find it
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
very strange that neither the
 
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.150 align:start position:0%
very strange that neither the
commissioner

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
nor miss carlson approached the chair of
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
the committee with this need
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
so well i think miss carlson you should
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
know her husband's been in the icu for
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
six weeks before he passed
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
away i know that i subsequently have
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
seen her this weekend and she was
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
talking about just getting caught up she
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
hadn't realized we'd cut the 11 million
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
from des
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think she has perhaps not been is on
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
top of things in the last six weeks that
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
she ordinarily would be given her
 
00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
personal situation so
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure she or the commissioner
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
were fully aware of this until she
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
brought it up with me
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee you're saying your
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
contention is the commissioner doesn't
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
know what's in his budget because this
 
00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.150 align:start position:0%
know what's in his budget because this
mercury

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
mercury
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
analyzer is not something we cut
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i would put it that
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
way but apparently
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why you didn't hear from
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner i can only speculate as
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
to why you didn't hear from
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
ms carlson matt do you have a comment
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
the only thing that i would add and the
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
comment at the bottom is correct this
 
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
comment at the bottom is correct this
was

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
included in the governor's march third
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
letter of areas we
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
but not included in his budget that's
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
correct but
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
yes not included in his budget
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
question ma'am chair representation does
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
anyone know what this person or this
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
position does
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'll analyze mercury or no i believe
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
this is a piece of equipment not a
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
person this is this is literally a piece
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
of equipment that they use
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment i'm kind of
 
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:22.150 align:start position:0%
a piece of equipment i'm kind of
surprised

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
surprised
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
i think maybe the reason we didn't hear
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
from commissioner scott is we
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
he might have some federal funds to
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
replace this rather than general funds
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
because it seems like something that
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner scott would have been on
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
top of and i know
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
um he's not contacting me at all
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding madam chairs they need
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
general funds for this but
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm going to move to itl this
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
because we have not heard from the
 
00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
because we have not heard from the
commissioner

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
and it was not in the original
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'd like to point out though
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
that the governor did ask for it in his
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent letters so clearly the
 
00:49:58.800 --> 00:49:59.270 align:start position:0%
subsequent letters so clearly the
governor

00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner are aware of the
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
need for it i can't imagine the governor
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
would have put it in his letter without
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
we cannot discuss without a second when
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
you haven't given me a chance to see if
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
there's a second on the motion represent
 
00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.069 align:start position:0%
there's a second on the motion represent
walls

00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
walls
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you representative leishman
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
seconds for discussion i proposed to itl
 
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:20.630 align:start position:0%
seconds for discussion i proposed to itl
this

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
because it was not in the governor's
 
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.829 align:start position:0%
because it was not in the governor's
budget

00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has not contacted me i
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't believe he's contacted the vice
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
chairman either as he would have sent
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
that on to me
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
and while the governor has put this in a
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
letter the governor was not proposing
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
any cuts to do that
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
the cut we had to make in des i work
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
very hard to get
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
an a
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
corresponding section into hb2
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
that should we have revenues that go up
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
given the pandemic
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
we would be able to fund all those
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment programs because
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's something i've been
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
very fond of funding but i think that's
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
got to be my top priority and that's
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
where we had to
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
leave this given the ways and means
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
revenues in the house
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why i voted to itl this
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
motion i do think that the commissioner
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
who has contacted me many times about
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
many things could have reached out
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thanks manager
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting the motion because i
 
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.270 align:start position:0%
i'll be supporting the motion because i
think

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's a little vague and coming at the
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
last minute and i
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
certainly like to get all the facts
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
before i would support something so i'll
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
oh i feel very sorry for susan carlson i
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
do too
 
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think we'll have to send i'll get her
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
see no additional discussion on the
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
motion to itl
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment if the clerk could call
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
madam chairman yes vice chairman yes the
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative griffin yes
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative lischmann yes
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative walsh no
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
voters six to one vote is six to one
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
um this next amendment
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
is about department of energy
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
administrative support
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
it is a representative walls amendment
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
multiple pages so let me pass it out
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
let me have mr hoffman bring it up
 
00:52:26.319 --> 00:52:28.150 align:start position:0%
let me have mr hoffman bring it up
online

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
and represent walls if you could work us
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
through page
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
one first and then we will look at page
 
00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.670 align:start position:0%
one first and then we will look at page
two

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
so these are positions that really have
 
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
puc functions and so the intent
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
is to have the puc position stay with
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
the puc and not move to the department
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's that applies to every single
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing that's set forth here
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so their administrators are so how
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
many positions are you talking
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh by class i would have to rely on mr
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
hoffman to help me with that but the
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
bottom if you look at the note at the
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
bottom it says it's a general counsel
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's a clerk it's an administrator two
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
hearing examiners
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
and a senior hearing examiner so those
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
are the positions all their i
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
confess i cannot always align them with
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
the class but that
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
is the note at the bottom summarizes the
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
positions i'm trying to move
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
class 10 permanent classified
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
and class 12 personal services
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
unclassified and you're moving
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
benefits is that correct
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
yeah to follow the positions that is
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
correct matt would did you discuss this
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
at some point with has this been a
 
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.470 align:start position:0%
at some point with has this been a
discussion

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
we did discuss this both with
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
and also our office given that the
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
has expressed authori has the express
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
duty and obligation in hb2 to provide
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
any necessary support to the puc as an
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agency
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
we don't see the need to move these
 
00:54:20.079 --> 00:54:22.829 align:start position:0%
we don't see the need to move these
positions

00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
um and we we we've come to the decision
 
00:54:25.599 --> 00:54:26.230 align:start position:0%
um and we we we've come to the decision
that

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
we'd prefer the current structure so
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
you're not in favor is that you're not
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment you prefer it
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
was that the bottom line all right
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative lischmann all a question
 
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:38.950 align:start position:0%
representative lischmann all a question
man

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
man
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
shared to representative walls i'm
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
just curious the advantage as you heard
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
matt say administratively attached that
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
was going to be my question to you
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
if they're administratively attached the
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
puc to the department of energy
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
what would be the advantage of what
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
you're proposing
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
well because the function actually is
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
like one of these is like for hearings
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
the hearings actually occur in the puc
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
the biggest one honestly is the general
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
counsel is the puc is an adjudicatory
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
body and
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
this reform has stripped it of its
 
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.870 align:start position:0%
this reform has stripped it of its
lawyers

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
and there's talk of using the lawyers
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
from the department of justice the fact
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the matter is the department of
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
justice doesn't have anybody
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
currently trained in public utility law
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
highly specialized area of law when
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
they've used them in the past they've
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
had problems with not getting adequate
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh services out of them where they've
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
literally had to rewrite things that
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
came out of doj
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to have them have their
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
own general counsel
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps even a stack and lawyer with
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
them but at least their own general
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
counsel who understands public utility
 
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
counsel who understands public utility
law

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
and can help these non-lawyer
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
adjudicators come up with an appropriate
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh decision in their hearings
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
i there is not a public utility
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
commission in the country i believe that
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have their own general counsel
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
it just seems like by stripping the
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
general counsel's office and these
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
these other positions are more support
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
positions but by stripping this out
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's a bridge too far it's just taken so
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
much out that it eviscerates the public
 
00:56:11.349 --> 00:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
utility commission
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it's in the interest of
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
everyone both us
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the the utilities to have a a
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
well-functioning public utility
 
00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:19.510 align:start position:0%
well-functioning public utility
commission

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i think as proposed this does not
 
00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.870 align:start position:0%
and i think as proposed this does not
happen

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative policeman a question for
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
either matt or the chair of
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
i do recall there were several attorneys
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
left with the department of energy do
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know how many
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
our intention was to leave all of the
 
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.230 align:start position:0%
our intention was to leave all of the
attorneys

00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
at the department of energy the reason
 
00:56:44.799 --> 00:56:45.670 align:start position:0%
at the department of energy the reason
being

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
a is that those are existing
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
hierarchical relationships right the puc
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
as it currently exists as a legal
 
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:51.910 align:start position:0%
as it currently exists as a legal
division

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we kept all of those direct reports
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
together in the support division
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
the support division again has the
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
express duty to support both the
 
00:56:59.599 --> 00:57:00.470 align:start position:0%
express duty to support both the
department

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the commission those lawyers would
 
00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.069 align:start position:0%
and the commission those lawyers would
support

00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
both the state's regulatory efforts from
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
the department to build the record
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
while also other attorneys and we didn't
 
00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.430 align:start position:0%
while also other attorneys and we didn't
prescribe

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
how many or which individuals would
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
support the commission
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do their work and just as a separate
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
point of information i believe the puc
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
expressly pays for two attorneys
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
that do puc issues a hundred percent of
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
the time at doj
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
um i do believe that one of the things
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
that's happened is the general counsel's
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
position at the puc is being abolished
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe that
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
person does not transfer over to the
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
department of energy if i read this
 
00:57:44.559 --> 00:57:45.829 align:start position:0%
department of energy if i read this
correctly

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
that is correct that position is
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
abolished at the end of its current
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
term it would continue to exist until
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
that term expires so not abolished at
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the biennium but
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
whenever the position was
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
due to expire anyway that's correct
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
so that the term ends at some point in
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
so the position is abolished at the end
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
of fiscal 23.
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
matt have we passed a a separate
 
00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:13.430 align:start position:0%
matt have we passed a a separate
amendment

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
abolishing that or does that already
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
exist that was in hb2 is introduced
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative madam chair i would move
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
itl i think we have to let the governor
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
organize the way he wants to organize
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
and not second-guess it
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that in a second
 
00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:35.990 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that in a second
representative

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%

um the discussion was from
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative emerick that he thinks
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
the governor needs to organize and they
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
need to see how this works
 
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
before we make additional changes
 
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
before we make additional changes
additional

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%

i just for my own clarity could
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
marry gus please again iterate the
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
potential consequences
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
to the department of energy with the
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
elimination of this
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
um position
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not eliminate any
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%

00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
and it would refund the general counsel
 
00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:30.710 align:start position:0%
and it would refund the general counsel
position

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%

that that nine you position is currently
abolished

00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
abolished
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium yeah this
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't restore it
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
so ergo the concern for the change i
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
guess is what i'm looking for
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
to be made clear
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
if may i if i may address it yes you may
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
um it's it really comes down to how well
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
it functions how well the public utility
 
00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
commission functions
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
if their staff is in the department of
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
energy and not answerable to the
 
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.230 align:start position:0%
energy and not answerable to the
commission

00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
and if they no longer have a general
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
counsel uh the belief is is that they're
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
just going to be not particularly
 
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.309 align:start position:0%
just going to be not particularly
functional

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
functional
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
and you know the the utilities this
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
is i feel a little bizarre doing this
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
because in many ways this is a position
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
that supports
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
private industry this supports the
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
utilities who want
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
a fully functional puc because they rely
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
on it they're regulating industries most
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
they cannot increase their rates they
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
cannot perform a lot of their basic
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
functions without the
 
01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
without a functioning puc and so this
 
01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:30.069 align:start position:0%
without a functioning puc and so this
allows

01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
the smooth functioning of the puc and
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
and allows the staff to stay where it
 
01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.230 align:start position:0%
and allows the staff to stay where it
actually

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
does its work and it just seems to me to
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
be a logical flow of having the staff
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
that does the work for the puc
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the puc representation
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
so madam chair i'm going to rely heavily
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
on again
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
reaching out to some legislative
 
01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.309 align:start position:0%
reaching out to some legislative
colleagues

01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
that looked at this last year and one of
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
the things that struck me and i
 
01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.549 align:start position:0%
the things that struck me and i
underlined

01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
underlined
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
from uh former chairman backus isn't he
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
also an attorney
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes bob because he was cheering science
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
and tech last biennium okay
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
and he says here but in my view a
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
serious reworking of the puc is long
 
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.190 align:start position:0%
serious reworking of the puc is long
overdue

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
overdue
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
so with that i will support the motion
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
of itm
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's basically what i had gotten when
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
i reached out to find out about the work
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
group last year as well was that there
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
was feeling that the puc needs some
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
reorganization and
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a fresh way of looking at things
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
to go forward
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may address
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative leishman's observation
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
i too got that email from representative
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
backus and i don't necessarily disagree
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
i just think again that this is a bridge
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
too far there is
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
already a major reorganization of the
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
puc happening
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
but deleting these positions is going to
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
limit its functionality and they're two
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
different things what
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative backus is concerned about
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
is moving a lot of the policy positions
 
01:01:59.829 --> 01:01:59.839 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
my amendment does not undo that the
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
policy positions that he felt were an
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
impediment to
 
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
shall we say progress in the energy
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
field continue to be with the department
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is an administrative thing that
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
just is really more administrative
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
functions this is not
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
the policy changes he was concerned
 
01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
the policy changes he was concerned
about

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion on the floor we've
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
been discussing it the motion
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
is itl on this amendment we've had
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
ample discussion with the clerk call the
 
01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.349 align:start position:0%
ample discussion with the clerk call the
rule

01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
madam chairman yes vice chairman yes
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%

01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative lischmann yes
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative hatch no representative
 
01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.670 align:start position:0%
representative hatch no representative
walls

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
no the vote is five to two
 
01:02:48.069 --> 01:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment is itl now that
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
was pages i think one and two however
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
there was a separate if you
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
um mr hoffman if you can bring up the
 
01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.190 align:start position:0%
um mr hoffman if you can bring up the
budget

01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
footnote which we have not discussed nor
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
have we voted on
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative wallace this is your
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
proposal please speak
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
um yes it was um the idea being that
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
there were two attorneys that were
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
coming out of this reorganization at doj
 
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
that were going to be assigned to the
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy and again in an
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
attempt to provide
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
adequate legal support to the public
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
utility commission the idea was to have
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
one assigned to the department of energy
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.839 --> 01:03:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
commission

01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
additional discussion
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none if the clerk could call the
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
role madam chairman
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
yes vice chairman yes yes president
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
griffin yes representative
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay i have another representative
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.839 --> 01:04:57.829 align:start position:0%
 
hb220210943h

01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent walls i would like you to
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
go through this section by section
 
01:05:01.359 --> 01:05:03.270 align:start position:0%
go through this section by section
please

01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
dan let me pull it up the way you've got
 
01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
it um
 
01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
yep i got the same thing on my screen um
 
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
so there is a division in the public
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
utility commission
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's a division of security and safety
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that the
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
head of that division has become a
 
01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.430 align:start position:0%
head of that division has become a
nationally

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
nationally
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
known expert and he
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
is the reason that we did not have
 
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh the gas explosions in people's homes
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
like they had in massachusetts with
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
columbia gas
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
because he held the gas companies here
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to a higher standard
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
that made sure that there was enough
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
safety that we didn't have those kinds
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
of issues
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
um he is so much the national expert
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
that last month when the texas
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
electrical system failed for failure to
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
winterize he is the person they turned
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
to nationally and said how do we fix
 
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.109 align:start position:0%
to nationally and said how do we fix
this

01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and it is a function that i think
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
really should stay in the public utility
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
commission given the nature of the
 
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:04.870 align:start position:0%
commission given the nature of the
function

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
and at relating directly to uh utilities
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's safety and security
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
for utilities and uh
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
the idea is and and this came up in the
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment i voted
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
against earlier that this would be a
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
another division head
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
it would be a gnc approved position and
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
it would allow him
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
and his staff to uh
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
be moved or remain in the puc where they
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
would do their work
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
ensuring the safety and security of all
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
of our utilities in the state
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
and my concern is is that if we put him
 
01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:40.470 align:start position:0%
and my concern is is that if we put him
in

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
energy under the division of enforcement
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose him
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
and i think he's an incredibly valuable
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
asset i think his
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
job warrants being at the division level
 
01:06:50.079 --> 01:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
job warrants being at the division level
um

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
with a gnc approval and so that's why i
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
put this amendment in
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
to try and take that division and put it
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
back in the puc where i think it can be
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
most effective and he can be most
 
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:01.349 align:start position:0%
most effective and he can be most
effective

01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
or his successor okay but you were asked
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
to go through the amendment line by line
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
so could you please start
 
01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
with line section two lines three
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
through six
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
and walk us through the amendment and
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
tell us what is going on in each section
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay so number two says that the natural
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
gas companies report
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
well it's pretty self-explanatory they
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
report to the uh
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
department the president center and the
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the uniform
 
01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:33.910 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the uniform
matter

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
for lost and and gas each year that's
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
part of the safety we're talking about
 
01:07:37.839 --> 01:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
part of the safety we're talking about
really

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's the energy department
 
01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
in that that part yes
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
um but then it goes on and it says
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
transfer powers and functions
 
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.510 align:start position:0%
transfer powers and functions
um

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know i honestly did not read this as
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
closely as i should have
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
um i know what i asked for and what i
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
explained to you is what i asked for but
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
you're right it appears that
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning part of this relates to
 
01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
the department of energy the second part
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
then starting on section 205
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
relates to the puc and if you get down
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the puck
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
but what about lines 10 through 13
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
um you've jumped ahead to line 27
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
i have and you're right it says that
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this stuff stays in the department of
 
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:27.110 align:start position:0%
this stuff stays in the department of
energy

01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
um as of september 1st 2021
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
so um it is the personnel
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
it is some of the regulatory stuff stays
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the department of energy
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
some of it then goes down to the
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
pipeline program to the puc
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
and madam chair i did not look at this
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
line by line i looked at this as an
 
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:47.749 align:start position:0%
line by line i looked at this as an
overall

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
knowing what i asked for in an amendment
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair i cannot i can offer
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
um some help with the technical changes
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
the or the detailed changes because i
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
worked on this for representative waltz
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful mr hoffman
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
on the top of the first page that
 
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.749 align:start position:0%
on the top of the first page that
paragraph

01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
adds the gas pipeline safety program
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
to the list of
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
those receiving the report
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
on line 10 there's an exception
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
to this rsa 363 22a
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
which is for the gas
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
then this reporting here
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
was is assigned to the gas pipeline
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
safety program on line 18.
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
and also it describes
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
who the report is sent to how much of
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is in existing law because nothing
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
most of this with the exception of a new
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
section below is existing law that's
 
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.470 align:start position:0%
section below is existing law that's
being

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
changed to retain the separate
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
um to retain the program as a separate
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
unit or make the program a separate unit
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
which would be under the puc as opposed
 
01:10:45.189 --> 01:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the energy department
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
representation do you have a question
 
01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking as perplexed as i am
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
yes man of chair thanks um i'm still
 
01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
having a hard time getting my head
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
around this
 
01:10:57.990 --> 01:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
if they're administratively attached the
 
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.590 align:start position:0%
if they're administratively attached the
puc

01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
puc
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't this function have even
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
more strength
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
under the department of energy versus
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
just a sub
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
category of the like the puc i
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's all one functioning new
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
department it's kind of like the water
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
resources board
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
is kind of administratively attached to
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
des i don't know i'm
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'm troubled i guess represent griffin
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the governor has
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
presented a plan
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
for the department of energy and we
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
ought to let that plan go forward and
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may address
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
representation somebody is speaking at
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
the moment representative laws your hand
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
is not up
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative griffin contin i mean
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
were you done well i'd like to make a
 
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
motion to itless
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
all right representative griffin is
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
moving to itl
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich is seconding
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh discussion of the motion represent
 
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.229 align:start position:0%
uh discussion of the motion represent
walls

01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you manager so i thought the
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative was done speaking i was
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
not trying to interrupt anyone
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
um i i did this solely because i want to
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that this position
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
has the strength and the authority to do
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
the enforcement that it needs to be done
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
and that it it is an independent
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
division and
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
while i admittedly am not as intimately
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with the details as expressed
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
in here
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
i do understand the concept and i think
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
the concept
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
is one that will provide the greatest
 
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
protection for the residents of this
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
see no further discussion on the motion
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
to itl
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
house bill two amendment two zero two

motion passes five to two there is
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
attached to this
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
a second amendment which
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think can go into effect without
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
the first amendment but we probably need
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
to vote on it
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
because this is the hb1 amendment
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
that moved
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.6 million dollars
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
around in the department of energy over
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%

01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%

representative

01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair i just and i know
 
01:14:04.709 --> 01:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's been said and i
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
just like it you said one more time i
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
think the governor's budget director has
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
made it pretty clear at least to me
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
that whether it be the gas line safety
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
program or whatever
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
it will still have the same strength to
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
even be enhanced
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
with the department of energy is that
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
that is our intent and again given that
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's an administratively attached agency
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
to the extent that any interplay needs
 
01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:31.830 align:start position:0%
to the extent that any interplay needs
to

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
occur the department's required to
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%

01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
and it is repeating those three lines
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
that i read through page two section
 
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.950 align:start position:0%
that i read through page two section
three

01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
so what they have done is they have
 
01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
changed the amount
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
that a business may do this
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%

left my screen at home
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
tired of carting it around well i
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see anyone from the department
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
of revenue
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
right off the bat but if you are from
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
the department and able to answer this
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
i can i can try to reach someone perhaps
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
to answer this question
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative leishman said that's all
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
right representative walsh your hand is
 
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
right representative walsh your hand is
up

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
it is thank you man i'm sure so what
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
this is clearly is this is a step down
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
on the credit
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
my q question is are there any limits on
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
or is it just an unlimited credit that's
 
01:22:41.679 --> 01:22:42.310 align:start position:0%
or is it just an unlimited credit that's
allowed

01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
i understood from representative major
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it was unlimited now and that
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative almighty had some concern
 
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
about that
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
worked with representative major on this
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
when this came up in the
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that's why they passed this
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
unanimously but i did
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
i knew they were working on it we were
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
up here and then i just
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
the although i was home on thursday i
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
didn't listen in on their meeting
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know i i kind of like to know
 
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
why they're limiting it
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh it's a liability that should be on
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
our books and dra told them they
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't figure out how to put it on our
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
books i know that because representative
 
01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
books i know that because representative
walsh

01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
walsh
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
might have heard that but representative
 
01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
might have heard that but representative
major

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
told me that when i said why this change
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
and he said because
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so i've said okay thanks for the
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
amendment then he handed me the
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
amendment on friday
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes if i may just add to
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
this and i
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
and like i said i think it looks okay
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
that that's been a
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
great concern for a number of years is
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh unknown unquantified
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
liability to the state out there that
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
could be magnanimous
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be the only word i can think of
 
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:57.750 align:start position:0%
would be the only word i can think of
and

01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
the only question i have is is enough
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
ways and means was unanimous
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i that just connected with me my
 
01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.270 align:start position:0%
and i that just connected with me my
apologies

01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
i think this is fine i wasn't sure of
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the uh 500 or the 100
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's much better than what exists
 
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
today and if that was a compromise
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
between um within ways and means
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
i suppose i i don't have any place in
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
questioning that so i guess
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
thinking this through a little bit
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
longer i would support this
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you mr hatch without
 
01:24:33.199 --> 01:24:34.149 align:start position:0%

01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
we'll take care of the doc piece
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
so representative griffin moves ought to
 
01:34:59.679 --> 01:35:00.550 align:start position:0%
so representative griffin moves ought to
pass

01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
for representative emmerich seconds
 
01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:05.510 align:start position:0%
for representative emmerich seconds

representative hatch yes
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative walls yes seven or
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
nothing unanimous
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
motion passes seven to nothing
 
01:35:33.270 --> 01:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
okay the next lovely thing
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is the case of no good deed goes
 
01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.790 align:start position:0%
this is the case of no good deed goes
unpunished

01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
your name on this amount of chair yeah
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
no good d
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
goes unpunished um so we had
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
in das administratively attached
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
to das the law enforcement
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
accountability community and
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
transparency commission
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
and i previously
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
had an amendment to push the start date
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
until the last three months of the year
 
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
which we did not pass unanimously by the
 
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.229 align:start position:0%
which we did not pass unanimously by the
way

01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
then it turned out after that was done
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why i said no good deed goes
 
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:14.950 align:start position:0%
so that's why i said no good deed goes
unpunished

01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
unpunished
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
i left three months in there because it
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be easy for the senate when they
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
had more money
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
to fully fund it well then it turns out
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
it was budgeted incorrectly and there's
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
a study committee that has not
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
made its final recommendation so
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
when that came about we were asked
 
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
to remove the last three months
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
division two is going to put a section
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
in hb2
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
to allow some funding should that study
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee finish
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what it will look like
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
where it will be
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
so we need to vote to
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
remove the rest of the funding
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
as i said no good deed goes unpunished i
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
could have unfunded it but i wanted it
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be easy to put it back so
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
represent moves to accept
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
the hb1 amendment to remove the rest of
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
funding representative griffin seconds
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
represent walls your hand is up it is
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand this i'm
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
sorry i did not fully follow your
 
01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
sorry i did not fully follow your
explanation

01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
so this was the leah commission and
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
there was funding for it and this is to
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
unfund the end of it am i hearing you
 
01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.070 align:start position:0%
unfund the end of it am i hearing you
correctly

01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
the lia commission was administratively
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
attached to das
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it was funded for the biennium okay
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
i removed all but three months of the
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
funding in a previous amendment
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
i think the day after that or two days
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
after that
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
i was notified that it was budgeted
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
incorrectly and all of it should have
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
should be removed
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
and a study was still going on and they
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
hadn't decided how the commission would
 
01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.109 align:start position:0%
hadn't decided how the commission would
look

01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
or where would be attached and so we
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
were advised
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
to remove the rest of the funding
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
and mr landrigan who supports
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
division two is working with that study
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee and with the chair of division
 
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:24.870 align:start position:0%
committee and with the chair of division
two

01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
to get a section with appropriate
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
funding in into hb2
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
so that if um
 
01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
the study ends and they need money they
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
will have money
 
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
in order to fund themselves so this is
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
removing what was what should never have
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
been budgeted
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
so madam chair am i correct that we're
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
basically removing it from the aas but
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's being put in the budget elsewhere
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
so that the leah community no that's
 
01:38:53.199 --> 01:38:54.870 align:start position:0%
so that the leah community no that's
incorrect

01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's right hb2 is going to have a div
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
section that says when the study is
 
01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.030 align:start position:0%
section that says when the study is
finished

01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
finished
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
and if they go ahead with this there
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
will be funding
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
in order to establish it but it's not
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
yet determined
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
if it will go ahead what is this
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
this commission oh so if the commission
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
continues beyond
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
the issuance it hasn't started it may
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
not start
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
but if it does start from the study
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
there will be funding to start it up
 
01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.950 align:start position:0%
there will be funding to start it up
[Music]

01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
but the funding won't be here it's going
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know where the funding will go
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
finally it may come back into das
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
but division two is adding a little
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
section into hb2
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that will allow the governor to fund
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
the study is not complete that
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
establishes this commission
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
this was premature but if the commission
 
01:40:01.510 --> 01:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
thinks they need to keep going and the
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
governor doesn't then there's no funding
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
there's no commission yet well what has
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
it been that's been meaning what's the
 
01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.270 align:start position:0%
it been that's been meaning what's the
leo

01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
leo
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
nothing the study group has been meeting
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
the commission's not
 
01:40:15.910 --> 01:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
so they were a study group not a
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
commission and they might they may
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
evolve into a commission who knows
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
and if they do then the governor will
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
have discretion for money but the
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
members will not am i correct in
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
understanding this
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
i imagine if they do there will be a
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
comes forward and
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
since the funding has been set aside in
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
hb2 he will be able then
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
to have a fiscal note written to do that
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
but i have not been following this study
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
commission so i don't know where they
 
01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:50.870 align:start position:0%
commission so i don't know where they
are

01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'm sorry i don't have my
 
01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:53.910 align:start position:0%
madam chair i'm sorry i don't have my
hand

01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
up can i can i just ask
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
nancy the commission that that you're
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
referring to as lee act
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
was actually through executive order and
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
they did issue a final report
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
but they are still issuing reports and i
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
think there was an effort by the
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office to continue their work
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the form of a study to recommend
 
01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
another entity
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
to take form at some point and in doing
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
so they put money in house bill 2
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
and they also created these lines in
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1.
 
01:41:27.750 --> 01:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
and division 2 has been working
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
diligently with the governor's office
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
and with the interested parties to
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
formulate a more
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
cohesive plan and in communication with
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
division two they just recommended that
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
this be taken out it was premature
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
and any funding would come through their
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
work within house bill 2
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
and that really was not something
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
division 1 needed to included
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
within das budget at this time
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
i hope that helps nancy basically got
 
01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:55.750 align:start position:0%
i hope that helps nancy basically got
double

01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
double
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
funded correct yes and it's premature
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
was premature yes correct
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
nancy thank you for the explanation
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's much clearer i appreciate that
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay phantom chairman yes uh vice
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
the clerk vote yes representative
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
griffin yes representative leishman

representative hatch yes represent wals
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
and now that we've made our cuts
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
i have one more
 
01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:45.830 align:start position:0%
i have one more
amendment

01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
to fund some additional positions in das
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the das priority
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
number 15 number 20. if nancy are you
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
and this restores six unfunded positions
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
um administrative supervisor or
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
part-time person
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
purchasing assistant a public works
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
project manager
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
an accounting technician an admin
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
assistant to
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
an internal auditor and you can see
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
the sources here not all of them are
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
general funds some of them are from
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves to approve
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative griffin seconds
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
see no discussion could the clerk call
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
the roll phantom chair
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
yes there's also so let me just to be
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
clear i still don't see your hand up but
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
i guess you're talking
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh where does this money come from
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm trying to understand here
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
so the general fund and agency income
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's at the bottom two lines
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
yeah under source of funds it's fast to
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
read it microscopically so
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay so we're just basically expanding
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of money general fund money
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're spending at das
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes if you recall we cut out
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
the cyber insurance security insurance
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
that is now moved over to doit because
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
paid by every agency and every branch
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
and government
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
and then we found that the plant
 
01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.669 align:start position:0%
and then we found that the plant
maintenance

01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
was double funded partly in general
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
funds and in fact all of it in general
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
funds when all of it should have been
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
other agency transfers
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
and some of this expense some of that
 
01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:36.950 align:start position:0%
and some of this expense some of that
agency

01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
income that they get there and we have
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
previously done those amendments i think
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
maybe even two weeks ago thank you madam
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%

01:44:49.590 --> 01:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
understand what i'm voting on before i
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
vote that's all so thank you
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%

yes okay unanimous seven nothing
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent walls i would say that we have
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
seven bright
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
minds around this table and we all want
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
to understand what we're voting for and
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
i kind of don't like your implication
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
that you're the only one who does so
 
01:45:22.159 --> 01:45:22.629 align:start position:0%
that you're the only one who does so
please

01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
remember that all of us are working very
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
diligently some of us remember things
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
from before and we
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't need as much explanation and some
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
of us need more explanation so more
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
explanation is always fine but we are
 
01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.510 align:start position:0%
explanation is always fine but we are
all

01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
working on this this last amendment if i
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
could it comes from the governor's
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
budget page
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
525 is for the parole board
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
and this goes back to november last year
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
when i sat through the governor's budget
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
hearing in november
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
jennifer sargent the parole board
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
chairman wants to go into a more digital
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
environment for the parole board because
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
they get lots of paper
 
01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
and she did not have accurate funding
 
01:46:11.910 --> 01:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
and in november i asked her to go to the
 
01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:12.790 align:start position:0%
and in november i asked her to go to the
doit

01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
doit
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and get accurate funding
 
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the machines that she needed to get
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
in order to do this when she was here
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
she came she and doc commissioner helen
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
hanks came the very first day we started
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
budget deliberations
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
she still had not done that i told
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
reminded her that we were still waiting
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
for her to do that
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
she finally got this information to us
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what we've had to do is to revise
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
this budget somewhat
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
in order to include so that all five
 
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
members of the parole board
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
get the correct equipment and this has
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
run through
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
doit commissioner dennis goulet and he
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
has guaranteed
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
that it is correct at the same time she
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
came back and she said well
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
she'd forgotten some positions and she
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
needed this and she needed that
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
and it turns out one of the things
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
because she hadn't worked with the oit
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
that she didn't have was a thing called
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
a whap
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
a wireless access point which will be
 
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.310 align:start position:0%
a wireless access point which will be
installed

01:47:18.310 --> 01:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
installed
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
in their meeting room which will allow
 
01:47:21.199 --> 01:47:21.990 align:start position:0%
in their meeting room which will allow
their

01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
laptops to connect to the server
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
and to wireless be able to wirelessly be
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
able to read the paperwork
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
so this includes the needed networking
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
equipment as well
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
because otherwise they were going to
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
have five ipads with no ability to get
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the network and now they're going to
 
01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:39.669 align:start position:0%
on the network and now they're going to
have

01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
five of those little dell computers like
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet had when he was here
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
so this brings the appropriations
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
up and as you see at the bottom of this
 
01:47:52.709 --> 01:47:52.719 align:start position:0%
it says amounts in addition to existing
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
appropriations in classes 37 and 38
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's because this includes hardware
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
and software networking hardware
 
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
computing hardware and software needed
 
01:48:04.790 --> 01:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
to run the system she'd propose
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
so this gives her 100 percent funding
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
for her board
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:16.709 --> 01:48:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative emerick moves out to pass
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
the clerk could call the roll on this
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
madam chairman yes vice chairman yes the
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%

those two things
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
we can finally approve the doit budget
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%

01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
no i don't see anything else the hardest
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%

78 through 91 and hb2
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative griffin i'm sorry
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative eric mooz representative

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
i think you guys have probably all read
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
this a hundred times represent walls
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
i just want to understand what we're
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
doing to the israelis and dividends tax
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
here i'm not as fast
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
what's in hb2 the hb2 you've had
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to come back and remember
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
this so i was looking for some guidance
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
do you recall madam chair their vote was
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
it unanimous like the revenue numbers
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
or i don't recall norm saying anything
 
01:51:29.599 --> 01:51:30.709 align:start position:0%
or i don't recall norm saying anything
except

01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
except
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
we were unanimous on this amendment we
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
approved going ahead on the tax cuts
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i didn't specifically ask him the
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
reason i
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
talked to him a little more about that
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
amendment was he had made a fairly
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
significant change and i was going to
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
try to have to come and explain some
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
ways and means in here
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
whereas this has been here for a while
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure if i may yes
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
can we ask perhaps either mike or nancy
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
to explain
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're doing here because
 
01:52:05.669 --> 01:52:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's when you read it it's not
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
immediately apparent
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page section 78
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
this amends the interest and dividend
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
tax law
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
starts online at the end of 28
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
for all taxable periods ending before
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
december 31st
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
then line 30 the annual tax
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
upon income shall be levied at the rate
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
of 4
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
so it goes down a percentage
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
line 32 the annual tax rate upon income
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
shall be levied at the rate of 3
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
for all taxable periods ending on or
 
01:52:53.599 --> 01:52:54.149 align:start position:0%
for all taxable periods ending on or
after

01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
december 31st 24
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
line 34 the annual tax income
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
is levied at the rate of 2 percent line
 
01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.950 align:start position:0%
is levied at the rate of 2 percent line
36

01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
36
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
the annual tax upon income shall be
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
levied at the rate of 1
 
01:53:12.070 --> 01:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
for all taxable periods
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
so what this does is reduce the amount
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
of income tax
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
that many of us pay in the state of new
 
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:19.189 align:start position:0%
that many of us pay in the state of new
hampshire

01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
over those periods by that percentage
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
and madam chair
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
on page 43 line
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
90 i'm sorry line 35 section 90
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
actually repeals the tax for the taxable
 
01:53:34.239 --> 01:53:35.189 align:start position:0%
actually repeals the tax for the taxable
periods

01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
periods
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
beyond december 31st 2026
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it's a step down and a final phase
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
out and everything in between
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
is language in the statutes referring to
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
the ind
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
tax and just for the position of clarity
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
i did double check with the ethics
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee because i do pay this income
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
tax in new hampshire
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
however there are thousands of people
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
who pay it so i was told ethically i was
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
vote on this because it did not just put
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
money in my pocket so i did double check
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
that before
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
we got here representative leishman
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
manager if i think you and i should both
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
pay this should i vote against the
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
amendment oh if you think we should keep
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
paying income tax then you vote against
 
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
these sections representative leishman
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%

01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
paying income tax in new hampshire
 
01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:31.870 align:start position:0%

walsh

01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
walsh
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
no against my interest because i pay a 2
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm still voting no
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay 43
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay if you could turn now to page 44
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have more um
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and these are sections 92
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
and 94 and these will
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
probably all be four to three as
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
republicans tend not to want to tax
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
people so we're always voting to lower
 
01:55:25.599 --> 01:55:27.830 align:start position:0%
people so we're always voting to lower
taxes

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
and this is the lowering of the rooms
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
and meals tax
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment on this so this
 
01:55:33.679 --> 01:55:34.709 align:start position:0%
there is no amendment on this so this
stays

01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
stays
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%

what we're doing here particularly with
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
the new to meals tax is
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive and will do more damage
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
than good

it starts on line 37 of page 44 and
immediately

01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
flips over to page 45
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
and again this is the business
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax and this reduces the rate
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
from 0.0675
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%

01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
nancy and mike i think we've concluded
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
our work
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
how about a sanity check um
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i have a brain left
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh just a quick question
 
01:59:24.229 --> 01:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah in your vote on sections 92 and 94
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
he did not include
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
section 93 which is an applicability
 
01:59:28.840 --> 01:59:30.550 align:start position:0%
section 93 which is an applicability
date

01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
and uh wait a minute so
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if there was 92 to 94. yes
 
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
we did 92 93 and 94.
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
92-94 okay two okay
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
the only other que the only 95-9
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
so it's 96 got done just wanted to
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
double check with yeah nope thank you
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
the only other question that i had was
 
01:59:53.189 --> 01:59:53.199 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
94 and uh correct me again if i'm wrong
 
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
there were sections related to energy
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
but it has to do with the
 
02:00:04.229 --> 02:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
um business and economic affairs taking
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
on the peace from
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
osi so they were sections
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh 9196 through
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
199 starting on page 94.
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
so assuming that you approve the doe as
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
you did earlier these would be
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
um i i just didn't have a record of how
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
and we did them so long ago i can't
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
remember well that could be my problem
 
02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:38.390 align:start position:0%
remember well that could be my problem
too

02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:00:40.070 --> 02:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh well you know what we're just going
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
to be careful representative
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
emmerich will move to approve section
 
02:00:44.599 --> 02:00:48.310 align:start position:0%
emmerich will move to approve section
196

02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
is it just one section nancy it's
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
through 199.
 
02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.109 --> 02:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
and and representative
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
griffin will second that and we'll just
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote that i can't remember
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
you can't remember that's a bad sign
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
so we'll be careful madam chairman this
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
is regard to what these are um
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
bea business of economic affairs
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
adopting and incorporating the office of

i know we approved his budget i can't
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
remember if we included these sections
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
at the same time so let's just vote them
 
02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:33.910 align:start position:0%
at the same time so let's just vote them
separately

02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
separately
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
