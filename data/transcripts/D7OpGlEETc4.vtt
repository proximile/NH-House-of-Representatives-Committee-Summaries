00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
actually get the stability so 40t I
 

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.389 align:start position:0%
actually get the stability so 40t I
think<00:10:38.279><c> is</c><00:10:38.440><c> not</c><00:10:38.600><c> too</c><00:10:38.800><c> bad</c><00:10:39.000><c> so</c><00:10:39.160><c> there's</c><00:10:39.279><c> an</c>

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
think is not too bad so there's an
 

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
think is not too bad so there's an

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.629 align:start position:0%
advantage being the granite state yes
yes<00:10:42.600><c> so</c><00:10:43.000><c> I</c><00:10:43.079><c> think</c><00:10:43.279><c> that's</c><00:10:43.440><c> a</c><00:10:43.720><c> pretty</c><00:10:44.120><c> quick</c><00:10:44.399><c> and</c>

00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
yes so I think that's a pretty quick and
 

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:47.829 align:start position:0%
yes so I think that's a pretty quick and

are those second part is which of those
do<00:38:53.839><c> you</c><00:38:53.960><c> think</c><00:38:54.160><c> should</c><00:38:54.960><c> could</c><00:38:55.160><c> some</c><00:38:55.319><c> of</c><00:38:55.440><c> those</c>

do you think should could some of those
 

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.990 align:start position:0%
do you think should could some of those
be<00:38:55.760><c> eliminated</c><00:38:56.440><c> or</c><00:38:56.560><c> should</c><00:38:56.760><c> they</c><00:38:56.880><c> be</c>

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
be eliminated or should they be
 

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.470 align:start position:0%
be eliminated or should they be

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%

seems weird to me is incarceration is
 

03:58:12.600 --> 03:58:15.269 align:start position:0%
seems weird to me is incarceration is

03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
dramatically lower and and so you're
 

03:58:18.359 --> 03:58:21.030 align:start position:0%
dramatically lower and and so you're
saying<03:58:18.640><c> it's</c><03:58:18.960><c> because</c><03:58:19.120><c> there's</c><03:58:19.359><c> less</c><03:58:20.040><c> crime</c>

03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
right but saying that's one element but
 

03:58:23.439 --> 03:58:26.469 align:start position:0%
right but saying that's one element but
the<03:58:23.680><c> crime</c><03:58:24.000><c> that</c><03:58:24.199><c> there</c><03:58:24.479><c> is</c><03:58:25.319><c> is</c><03:58:25.760><c> increasingly</c>

the crime that there is is increasingly
 

03:58:26.479 --> 03:58:28.590 align:start position:0%
the crime that there is is increasingly

03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%

03:58:28.600 --> 03:58:31.590 align:start position:0%

that<03:58:28.840><c> why</c><03:58:29.600><c> that's</c><03:58:29.840><c> why</c><03:58:30.760><c> both</c><03:58:31.000><c> numbers</c><03:58:31.319><c> are</c><03:58:31.439><c> not</c>

03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
that why that's why both numbers are not
 

03:58:31.600 --> 03:58:34.469 align:start position:0%
that why that's why both numbers are not
going<03:58:31.840><c> down</c><03:58:32.040><c> in</c><03:58:32.199><c> a</c><03:58:32.359><c> similar</c><03:58:32.800><c> way</c><03:58:33.239><c> is</c><03:58:33.399><c> that</c><03:58:34.159><c> it's</c>

03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
going down in a similar way is that it's
 

03:58:34.479 --> 03:58:36.910 align:start position:0%
going down in a similar way is that it's

04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
than it was uh six plus months ago so
 

04:05:56.640 --> 04:05:59.030 align:start position:0%

we're<04:05:56.760><c> moving</c><04:05:57.040><c> in</c><04:05:57.159><c> the</c><04:05:57.319><c> right</c><04:05:57.520><c> direction</c><04:05:58.520><c> but</c>

04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the right direction but
 

04:05:59.040 --> 04:06:02.030 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the right direction but
we<04:05:59.199><c> would</c><04:05:59.399><c> then</c><04:05:59.680><c> move</c><04:06:00.120><c> those</c><04:06:00.399><c> lines</c><04:06:01.399><c> in</c><04:06:01.720><c> in</c><04:06:01.840><c> the</c>

04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
we would then move those lines in in the

we would then move those lines in in the

collectively<06:20:00.798><c> are</c><06:20:01.000><c> certainly</c><06:20:01.360><c> a</c><06:20:01.478><c> lot</c><06:20:01.600><c> of</c><06:20:01.798><c> work</c>

there<06:20:02.878><c> there</c><06:20:03.000><c> are</c><06:20:04.000><c> three</c><06:20:04.240><c> components</c><06:20:04.920><c> of</c><06:20:05.040><c> it</c>

06:20:05.270 --> 06:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
there there are three components of it
 

06:20:05.280 --> 06:20:07.628 align:start position:0%
there there are three components of it
right<06:20:05.478><c> now</c><06:20:05.840><c> one</c><06:20:06.040><c> is</c><06:20:06.240><c> the</c><06:20:06.400><c> civil</c><06:20:06.680><c> litigation</c><06:20:07.400><c> so</c>

06:20:07.628 --> 06:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
right now one is the civil litigation so
 

06:20:07.638 --> 06:20:10.910 align:start position:0%
right now one is the civil litigation so
so<06:20:07.840><c> the</c><06:20:07.958><c> civil</c><06:20:08.400><c> lawsuits</c><06:20:09.400><c> one</c><06:20:09.638><c> is</c><06:20:10.040><c> the</c><06:20:10.320><c> the</c><06:20:10.440><c> YDC</c>

06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
so the civil lawsuits one is the the YDC
 

06:20:10.920 --> 06:20:13.628 align:start position:0%
so the civil lawsuits one is the the YDC
settlement<06:20:11.400><c> fund</c><06:20:12.280><c> and</c><06:20:12.440><c> one</c><06:20:12.958><c> component</c><06:20:13.360><c> are</c>

06:20:13.628 --> 06:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
settlement fund and one component are
 

06:20:13.638 --> 06:20:16.230 align:start position:0%
settlement fund and one component are
are<06:20:13.798><c> the</c><06:20:13.920><c> criminal</c><06:20:14.520><c> cases</c><06:20:15.520><c> and</c><06:20:15.760><c> I</c><06:20:15.878><c> think</c><06:20:15.958><c> it</c><06:20:16.080><c> is</c>

06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
are the criminal cases and I think it is
 

06:20:16.240 --> 06:20:18.110 align:start position:0%
are the criminal cases and I think it is
putting<06:20:16.478><c> a</c><06:20:16.600><c> large</c><06:20:17.000><c> burden</c><06:20:17.478><c> certainly</c><06:20:17.840><c> on</c><06:20:18.000><c> the</c>

06:20:18.110 --> 06:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
putting a large burden certainly on the
 

06:20:18.120 --> 06:20:20.868 align:start position:0%
putting a large burden certainly on the

06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%

06:20:24.878 --> 06:20:26.830 align:start position:0%
defense bar um I would tend to submit
that<06:20:25.040><c> I</c><06:20:25.120><c> think</c><06:20:25.240><c> the</c><06:20:25.400><c> burden</c><06:20:25.718><c> is</c><06:20:25.920><c> far</c><06:20:26.240><c> greater</c>

06:20:26.830 --> 06:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
that I think the burden is far greater
 

06:20:26.840 --> 06:20:29.270 align:start position:0%
that I think the burden is far greater

06:20:48.510 --> 06:20:48.520 align:start position:0%

06:20:48.520 --> 06:20:50.788 align:start position:0%

06:20:52.948 --> 06:20:52.958 align:start position:0%

06:29:25.798 --> 06:29:26.990 align:start position:0%
through it before the more claims you do
I<06:29:25.920><c> think</c><06:29:26.040><c> it's</c><06:29:26.160><c> safe</c><06:29:26.360><c> to</c><06:29:26.440><c> say</c><06:29:26.680><c> probably</c><06:29:26.878><c> the</c>

06:29:26.990 --> 06:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's safe to say probably the
 

06:29:27.000 --> 06:29:29.030 align:start position:0%
I think it's safe to say probably the

06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
less work you're putting into each claim
 

06:29:29.040 --> 06:29:30.270 align:start position:0%
less work you're putting into each claim
and<06:29:29.160><c> so</c><06:29:29.360><c> it's</c><06:29:29.520><c> just</c><06:29:29.680><c> another</c><06:29:29.920><c> piece</c><06:29:30.080><c> of</c><06:29:30.160><c> this</c>

you know in a within a certain time
window<06:35:38.558><c> we</c><06:35:38.680><c> could</c><06:35:38.840><c> certainly</c><06:35:39.200><c> get</c><06:35:39.398><c> that</c>

06:35:39.548 --> 06:35:39.558 align:start position:0%
window we could certainly get that
 

06:35:39.558 --> 06:35:41.830 align:start position:0%
window we could certainly get that

06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
number yes well that would be important
 

06:35:41.840 --> 06:35:43.948 align:start position:0%
number yes well that would be important
because<06:35:42.080><c> at</c><06:35:42.200><c> least</c><06:35:42.360><c> that</c><06:35:42.478><c> would</c><06:35:42.680><c> give</c><06:35:42.840><c> us</c><06:35:43.040><c> one</c>

06:35:43.948 --> 06:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
because at least that would give us one
 

06:35:43.958 --> 06:35:46.670 align:start position:0%
because at least that would give us one
bound<06:35:44.600><c> that</c><06:35:44.718><c> we</c><06:35:44.840><c> could</c><06:35:45.080><c> work</c><06:35:45.478><c> with</c><06:35:46.120><c> and</c><06:35:46.280><c> say</c>

06:35:46.670 --> 06:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
bound that we could work with and say
 

06:35:46.680 --> 06:35:49.788 align:start position:0%
bound that we could work with and say
okay<06:35:46.958><c> well</c><06:35:47.398><c> at</c><06:35:47.520><c> least</c><06:35:47.760><c> now</c><06:35:47.958><c> we</c><06:35:48.120><c> know</c><06:35:49.080><c> this</c><06:35:49.200><c> is</c>

06:35:49.788 --> 06:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
okay well at least now we know this is
 

06:35:49.798 --> 06:35:52.670 align:start position:0%
okay well at least now we know this is
the<06:35:50.440><c> the</c><06:35:50.600><c> most</c><06:35:50.920><c> damage</c><06:35:51.280><c> that</c><06:35:51.440><c> can</c><06:35:51.558><c> be</c><06:35:51.760><c> done</c><06:35:52.440><c> Y</c>

06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
the the most damage that can be done Y
 

06:35:52.680 --> 06:35:54.150 align:start position:0%
the the most damage that can be done Y
and<06:35:52.840><c> then</c><06:35:52.958><c> we</c><06:35:53.080><c> can</c><06:35:53.200><c> work</c><06:35:53.478><c> backwards</c><06:35:53.920><c> from</c>

06:35:54.150 --> 06:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then we can work backwards from
 

06:35:54.160 --> 06:35:56.910 align:start position:0%
and then we can work backwards from
there<06:35:54.920><c> to</c><06:35:55.200><c> to</c><06:35:55.478><c> then</c><06:35:55.920><c> longterm</c><06:35:56.478><c> figure</c><06:35:56.718><c> out</c>

06:35:56.910 --> 06:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
there to to then longterm figure out
 

06:35:56.920 --> 06:36:00.070 align:start position:0%
there to to then longterm figure out
what<06:35:57.000><c> it</c><06:35:57.120><c> might</c><06:35:57.320><c> cost</c><06:35:57.638><c> us</c><06:35:57.958><c> financially</c><06:35:58.958><c> yep</c><06:35:59.520><c> so</c>

06:36:00.070 --> 06:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
what it might cost us financially yep so
 

06:36:00.080 --> 06:36:02.070 align:start position:0%
what it might cost us financially yep so
because<06:36:00.360><c> again</c><06:36:00.600><c> if</c><06:36:00.760><c> not</c><06:36:01.000><c> this</c><06:36:01.120><c> is</c><06:36:01.360><c> totally</c>

06:36:02.070 --> 06:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
because again if not this is totally

to do a lot of renovations to that space
 

06:52:26.638 --> 06:52:28.350 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of renovations to that space
it<06:52:26.718><c> was</c><06:52:26.878><c> built</c><06:52:27.120><c> into</c><06:52:27.440><c> the</c><06:52:27.520><c> lease</c><06:52:27.958><c> so</c><06:52:28.160><c> that's</c>

06:52:28.350 --> 06:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
it was built into the lease so that's
 

06:52:28.360 --> 06:52:30.948 align:start position:0%
it was built into the lease so that's
another<06:52:28.958><c> million</c><06:52:29.478><c> dollars</c><06:52:30.080><c> of</c><06:52:30.320><c> that</c><06:52:30.558><c> general</c>

another million dollars of that general
fund<06:52:31.440><c> increase</c><06:52:32.478><c> so</c><06:52:32.558><c> I</c><06:52:32.638><c> think</c><06:52:32.760><c> that's</c><06:52:32.920><c> a</c><06:52:33.160><c> that's</c>

06:52:33.270 --> 06:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
fund increase so I think that's a that's
 

06:52:33.280 --> 06:52:35.750 align:start position:0%
fund increase so I think that's a that's
a<06:52:33.520><c> first</c><06:52:33.878><c> important</c><06:52:34.558><c> point</c><06:52:34.840><c> to</c><06:52:35.040><c> note</c><06:52:35.478><c> is</c><06:52:35.600><c> that</c>

06:52:35.750 --> 06:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
a first important point to note is that
 

06:52:35.760 --> 06:52:38.670 align:start position:0%
a first important point to note is that

a lot of that is

07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
but it's the general the mix has shifted
 

07:00:00.718 --> 07:00:02.830 align:start position:0%
but it's the general the mix has shifted
towards<07:00:01.120><c> General</c><07:00:01.478><c> funds</c>

07:00:02.830 --> 07:00:02.840 align:start position:0%

that's<07:00:03.398><c> that's</c><07:00:03.600><c> kind</c><07:00:03.718><c> of</c><07:00:03.878><c> the</c><07:00:04.000><c> key</c><07:00:04.200><c> thing</c><07:00:04.718><c> and</c>

07:00:04.830 --> 07:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the key thing and
 

07:00:04.840 --> 07:00:06.948 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the key thing and
I<07:00:04.958><c> think</c><07:00:05.120><c> that</c><07:00:05.240><c> has</c><07:00:05.398><c> a</c><07:00:05.558><c> lot</c><07:00:05.718><c> to</c><07:00:05.878><c> do</c><07:00:06.120><c> with</c><07:00:06.360><c> grants</c>

07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%

mean I think it's helpful for us to
 

07:00:39.558 --> 07:00:42.070 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's helpful for us to
understand<07:00:40.558><c> where</c><07:00:40.840><c> those</c><07:00:41.120><c> cuts</c><07:00:41.478><c> are</c><07:00:41.718><c> and</c><07:00:41.920><c> what</c>

07:00:42.070 --> 07:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand where those cuts are and what
 

07:00:42.080 --> 07:00:44.548 align:start position:0%
understand where those cuts are and what
the<07:00:42.240><c> impacts</c><07:00:42.718><c> of</c><07:00:42.958><c> the</c><07:00:43.240><c> of</c><07:00:43.360><c> the</c><07:00:43.520><c> cuts</c><07:00:43.840><c> are</c><07:00:44.280><c> so</c><07:00:44.478><c> I</c>
