yesterday I know the information was
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
just handed out um and I'm not sure you
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
want me to sit here and go through all
 
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
of this it might be more productive for
 
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 align:start position:0%
you if we answered questions and and had
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
a conversation that way but that's
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
entirely up up to
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
you sure um just one quick note both um
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
representative Ms and myself uh have

Bill introductions at 10: so if you see
 
00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
us run out you know in the middle it's
 
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
no no reflection on you I appreciate
 
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
that um so yeah why don't um why don't
 
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
we just start give us a quick overview
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the major you know sections of your
 
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh department and then we'll get to our
 
00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
specific questions about so personnel
 
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that yeah so the the
 
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner this is
 
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
Michelle tibo who is my Administrative
 
00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 align:start position:0%
Assistant directly and there we have an
 
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
accountant and that uh and then the
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner under the
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office also uh is the
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
food safety modernization act which is
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
100% federally funded program with u one
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
full-time position and two part-time
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
positions we have um Agricultural
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
Development which really is promoting
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture running the uh New Hampshire
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
building at the Big E doing the weekly
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
Market Bulletin and all of our
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
Publications and handling the grants
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
that we have um that are primarily
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
Federal although there are some state
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
grants when when funded in there and
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
that division has the director um two
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
full-time people and a a part-time
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
person on on grants and oh I I suppose
 
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
under my department is also under my
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
division is also the um person who is
 
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
doing our rule
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
and our um hearing hearings and that is
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
funded through the fines that that come
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
in up to a level of 75,000 and that is
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
um looked at quarterly then we have um
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
the department of or the division
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
of uh pesticides
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
which obviously deals with licensing
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
those who apply pesticides and uh
 
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
registers all the products and there are
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
approximately I think
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
12,000 products that are registered in
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
that fund I think 75% of the the monies
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
collected there stay within that
 
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and 25% go to the general
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
fund um and they do an awful lot of
 
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
inspections and of course registrations
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they also do all the testing for all
 
00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 align:start position:0%
of the uh people working for the various
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
private companies around around the
 
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
state uh and that number I don't have
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but that's almost
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
a yearr round uh operation and testing
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
because there are so many people that
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
are coming and going and they do have to
 
00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
be recertified every five years they
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
have to do credits and we have to keep
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
track of all of that um regulatory
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
Services deals with a variety of things
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
the maple rules and and Grading Maple
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
and apples and all of those things um
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
but primarily their pet food
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
registration um and animal feed and
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
there are something like nearly 20,000
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
different products that are registered
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
through that
 
00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
division um and so a lot of activity
 
00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.550 align:start position:0%
division um and so a lot of activity
there

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
um then we have weights and measures
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
which again there's about 20,000
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
different devices that are licensed
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
through the uh through the division we
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
use um agents who are licensed by us
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
essentially to do go out and do the
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
actual testing of those devices on an
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
annual basis that includes everything in
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
a supermarket Farmers Market um gas
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
pumps oil
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
tankers um propane
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
trucks pretty much anything all the way
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
Masters the heavy scales and so those
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
people um all have to be licensed uh
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
through the state and uh currently the
 
00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:41.879 align:start position:0%
inspectors there are actually part-time
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
police officers we're actually having
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
discussions about removing that
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
requirement that's getting more and more
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to do and we don't actually
 
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
arrest anybody um and so with the
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
certifications that that may be
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
something we want to look at taking away
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
we're having discussions with the police
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
standards and training about that right
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
now um and 50% of the fees that come in
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
there go to the general fund and 50%
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
stay in the product fund animal industry
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately deals mostly with pet
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
vending um which is the bane of our
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
existence and really doesn't have
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
anything per se to do with agriculture
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
but that is pretty much where it is and
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
most most States right now there are
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
3177 pet vendors
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh oh no excuse me um I think there
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
areund some 60 some odd the 3177 is the
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
number of veterinarians are on our new
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
database system and just in the the last
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
30 days over 2,000 certificates of
 
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
transfers have been made for dogs cats
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
and ferrets which is a January is a slow
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
month we expect that number to be uh
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
probably when all is said and done
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 60,000 for the for the
 
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
year we also do blood testing in cattle
 
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh and poultry um and deal with a lot of
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
Animal Welfare issues when asked by the
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
police to assist them we do not have a
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
primary uh role in looking at um animal
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
abuse or any of of those things so we're
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
there to assist uh plant industry is
 
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:24.680 align:start position:0%
actually housed over at Hazen drive and
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
um they license all the green houses and
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
really work very hard to try to keep the
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
invasive species out which we are uh
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
seeing a lot of times people shipping in
 
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
plants that are not supposed to be
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
coming in but also plants that are
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
coming in that have invasive species on
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
them so we're dealing with that um there
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh across the way as some of you may
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
know we were housed in the U uh State
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
House Annex but we recently moved uh
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
last year over to um capital
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
place and um weights and measures has a
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
division called Metrology
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
which certifies all the weighing devices
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
that can be used now there we're just
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
back up and running after a long haul as
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact just the first of the
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
month we are back up and running but we
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't move that for one re for
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
several reasons but one is that the more
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
sensitive testing device sits on a block
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
of cement that goes down 40 ft into the
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
ground over in the annex so not very
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
practical and we're lucky there are
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
states that had to go much deeper to
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
actually get the stability so 40t I
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
think is not too bad so there's an
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
advantage being the granite state yes
 
00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
yes so I think that's a pretty quick and
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
basic overview of what we do I'm glad to
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions did we did you
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
mention Soil Conservation oh I did not
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
Soil Conservation is administratively
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
attached to us um and so we sort of
 
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
as a as the commissioner I am on the
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
State Board of conservation which covers
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
the 10 counties conservation um was set
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
up in the
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
1930s and each county has a district
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
um there is no direct State funding
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
going into that that's funded through
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
the Moose plate grants um and counties
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
also put money in some counties have
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
full-time people we recently um at a um
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh director for soil conservation which
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
has been extremely helpful in providing
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
the the coordination between the
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
districts and making sure that there is
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know everybody knows what's going on
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
and um their counties do have equipment
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
that can be rented out so there's some
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
coordination there but it's been a very
 
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
very helpful to have somebody there
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
overseeing everything other than having
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh 10 counties sort of out there on
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
their own and the only time knowing
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
what's going on is at a quarterly
 
00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:05.829 align:start position:0%
what's going on is at a quarterly
meeting

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming in how many what
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
what's your total head count so I
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
believe right now um we are at 44
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
full-time positions in in the department
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
within and then a 45th would be person
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
who actually works for doit who is
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
90% um with us now will be 10% with um
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
um uh well anyhow 90% uh for us so but
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
he is he is housed with with us and then
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have the two-part time in
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
um as I said in fsmo part-time in the um
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
a development and part-time in the um
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
animal industry dealing with the spay
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
and neuter
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
program he heard from uh oh in the
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
hearings officer part time thank you we
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
heard from the um Department of
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
administrative services that they
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
provide um HR services to some of the
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies is that the case with
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
you we yes we had a part-time person for
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
a while it hadn't been filled and then
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
we filled it and then it was we realized
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
that that was really a stepping stone to
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
full-time employment someplace else and
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
that's when administrative Services came
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
up with this idea that we could actually
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
contract with them for our HR Services
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
which we have been doing for about three
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
years now how has that worked that's
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
working out very very well for us very
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
pleased to have that available to
 
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.110 align:start position:0%
pleased to have that available to
us

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
wer thank you welcome
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
commission I thought I had it on um so I
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
I detect a longer growing season in my
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
garden has it helped agriculture at all
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
we have more profitable Farms are we
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
increasing Farmers any of those things
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
that that is such a variable because
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
you're right it is a longer growing
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
season the problem is we've had you know
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
either droughts or the rains and I think
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
what we're we're going to be seeing is
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
probably more people doing where they
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
can more green houses more um of the um
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah whether they're heated or not but
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
we've got a in the smaller operations
 
00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519 align:start position:0%
are going to try to to put in more of
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
these hoop houses that prevent the
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
weather from being such variable we
 
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
certainly did have a longer growing
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
season this year I think that Trevor
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hardy from over in Brookdale which is
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
really the the
 
00:14:51.749 --> 00:14:51.759 align:start position:0%
largest uh vegetable operation fruit
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
tree operation they were picking almost
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
up until Thanksgiving this year yeah
 
00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
up until Thanksgiving this year yeah
representative

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
eil thank you thank you for being here
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
um I uh have a question about your
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
division of plant industry um especially
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
about invasive species per se I have a
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
certain um deep hatred for Japanese
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
knotweed uh and I just wondered if you
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
could talk a little bit about that I've
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
seen in some States they're even
 
00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
requiring disclosures on real State um
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
transactions if there's an infestation
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
with not weed because it's undermining
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
foundations and is just horrendous so I
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
mean you can talk about that and
 
00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
invasives generally and anything you
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
care to share thank you now Japanese not
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
weed is one of the things I hate the
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
most too um and it is something that is
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to eradicate The Roots
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
can go down something like 30 feet and
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
so while you can spray it and you think
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
you have killed it and you can treat it
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
it will come back it is illegal to
 
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
transport soil in the state of New
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that has Japanese snot weed in
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
it um and at this point there is has
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
been no chemical treatment or even
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
non-chemical treatment that is
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
successful because of those Deep Roots
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
so that's something there's a lot of
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
research going on it on to see what can
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
be done but when you think you've killed
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you really haven't I had an area
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
that actually did an aseptic system on
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
you know going back over 40 years ago we
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
had just ignored the fact stuff was
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
growing on it weren't mowing it the
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
roots really did it
 
00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:46.839 align:start position:0%
in once we replaced that there was still
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
Japanese not with the there I started
 
00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
mowing that and it took me something
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
like seven years of mowing it every week
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
before it started coming up in that area
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I still can't get it get it get rid
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
of in the areas that I don't mow even
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
though I spray it with Roundup on a
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
regular basis well I mean I think it's a
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
threat to our Agland it's a you know
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
it's well because it I mean I've seen a
 
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
farm they've been trying to get rid of
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
it and they can't but I guess just in
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
terms of your program and what you do
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
generally with invasives I was curious
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
so if you could describe that and the
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
funding we just now have the one person
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
with limited funding for that but he's
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
more a coordinator we work closely with
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
do on the invasives along the highway
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
right aways there's a list in here of
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
projects we're working working with um
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
and this is we're working now more with
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
the towns treat te teaching them how to
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
deal with them because obviously um
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are some that are easier to get
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
rid of I worry less about what the
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
um uh naweed is doing versus the um and
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'm always having a hard time
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
remembering the vine that gets around
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
the trees and Bittersweet thank you I
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't know why I can't remember
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
that yeah and that really is you know
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
doing a number on our our forests
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
particularly on the edges of anything it
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
is much easier to get rid of but still
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's carried the seeds are carried by
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
birds it's everywhere um and there are a
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
lot of things out there so we're trying
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
very much to keep from having this stuff
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
spread we're never going to get rid of
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
it in my opinion at least not in my life
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
time um and so all we can do is work
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
with the towns to try to keep it
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
spreading and keep keep things under
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
control um but yeah it's a real problem
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
just just so just in terms of the budget
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
then you have one employee full-time
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
employee that concerns themselves with
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
this issue and they're they do some
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
education and they're also interfacing
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
with do on treatment and that that's
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
sort of the summary of that okay thank
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
you let me ask about you you mentioned
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
the Big E um is that something that
 
00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:06.039 align:start position:0%
would be more properly in the department
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
of travel and tourism I I don't think so
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
because really what we're we're trying
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
to do there and has always been done
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
originally when the building was built
 
00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.270 align:start position:0%
originally when the building was built
in

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
1930 um it was an
 
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799 align:start position:0%
independent uh commission but the
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture was always
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
involved and at some point it it became
 
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
the the sole responsibility of the
 
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.750 align:start position:0%
the the sole responsibility of the
commission

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
but we we are um working very hard to
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
get New Hampshire products into that
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
building for the 17-day fairs some of
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
our um vendors in there they don't
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
really do anything else the rest of the
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
year except build up their inventory of
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
products for that 17 days so uh it is
 
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
very important we try to do as much
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
agriculture as possible we try to work
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
with travel and and tourism but um you
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
know we are geared up for that that is
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
what we do and that is a good part of
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
what um a development does um certainly
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
with our history of running that
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
building and our relationship with all
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
of the vendors in there uh and with the
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
Big E itself I would not recommend that
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
moving in M as you see there really is
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
no budget for that because that is
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
largely self-funded except we have had
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
real problems with um trying to do
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
capital projects but there is also a
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
group in there called uh champions of
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farms they put a lot of
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
money back into that building um and and
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
that is working out well and my goal is
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um there is no drain
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
on state resources and I'm I'm hopeful
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
that in moving forward in the future
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
there are no capital projects for that
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
budget for that building it should be
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
self- sustained are you similarly
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
involved with like the hopkington fair
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
or Deerfield fair and other similar we
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
are not the only other real AG event
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
that we are in embedded in is farm and
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
farm forest and flowers or whatever it's
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
called Farm forest and garden so we have
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
a role in that but again not a direct
 
00:21:14.909 --> 00:21:14.919 align:start position:0%
budget we just have Personnel who work
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
in developing that and advertising that
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
but the fairs are all independent and we
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't have any relationship other than
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that I go around every farm and
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
every fair and give out the
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner's award for the best
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
promotion of agriculture
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative rung thank you Mr chair I
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
have a few questions um regarding the
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
Division of Weights and measures so
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
there's someone that goes around to
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%
calibrate and ensure that the weights
 
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
are accurate um are those just for
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
public facing um places that like
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
grocery stores places where the public
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
might rely on that weight for uh
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
consuming a product any any measuring
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
device in the state of of New Hampshire
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
is under our jurisdiction and it goes
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
beyond just the measuring devices for
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
instance we're also M um responsible for
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
making sure that anything such as beer
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
that is bottled in New Hampshire is
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
filled with the the right amount and we
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
investigations uh in that area so
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's a whole different standard there
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for making sure that
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
cordwood when somebody is selling a
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
court of wood it is a CT that's one of
 
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
the most difficult things to deal with
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
because somebody's going to say well I
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
delivered a cord they must have taken
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
some of it already it's unless you're
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
right there and you watch them stack
 
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
it's really hard of course patterns
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
develop with certain certain people and
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
we can deal with that but um
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
yeah any anything like candy that's sold
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
in bulk those scales also have to take
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
into into account the tear meaning the
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
candy sticks the wrappers have to be
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
removed and we deal with that a lot so
 
00:22:59.789 --> 00:22:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh anytime it is a
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
um a device that is used to sell
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
something to somebody then they have to
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
be you know registered if they're in a
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
restaurant and saying they're eight
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
ounces of meat and they're using a scale
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
there no we don't deal with with those
 
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
type of things where the sale is not
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
directly um okay so like a b a company
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
that might have a research and
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
development lab and relies on you know
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
um scales measure I mean you know uh uh
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
scales to measure something internally
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be subject no but they
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
could come to us and have those
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
calibrated if they were concerned about
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
it so we we can do any scale that anyone
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
wants to okay thank you and then um Mr
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
chair I have another question regarding
 
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.190 align:start position:0%
chair I have another question regarding
the

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
um um oh uh when you spoke about the
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
division of animal industry have you
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
been involved or tracking at all the
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
spread of bird flu Oh constantly that
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
has been a big timec consuming issue for
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
for myself and for the uh uh division
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm constantly I shouldn't say
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
constantly on a regular basis I am on
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
calls through um Animal Health on a
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
national level with USDA with the uh
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
National Association State Departments
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture uh as the uh the state
 
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian is very involved in calls
 
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
with um our Department of Health and
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
Human Services is we're currently um
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
working with them to collect milk
 
00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
samples from all the um all the milk
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
silos if you will from every dairy farm
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
in the state to make sure that we have
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
non- detect there um so it is taking up
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of our time currently and then uh
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
just one more question Mr chair um your
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
activities are really interesting and
 
00:24:55.149 --> 00:24:55.159 align:start position:0%
they seem like it's really fun thing to
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
be involved with and I was just
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
wondering do you have any interface with
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
schools for student internships where
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
students might have some experience
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
working along your fol we we do not um
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
we have inquiries about that but we're
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
we try try to uh send people to
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension the University of
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for things like that we
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
really don't have the time or the
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
Staffing to really do those type of
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
inter internships I wish we did but that
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
is just something that we don't have the
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
ability to do okay excuse me okay thank
 
00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:28.950 align:start position:0%
ability to do okay excuse me okay thank
you

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to take the next question
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
but afterwards it can be representative
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
mths so um looking at the list of new
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
positions it looks like you've added
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
three general fund positions um and uh
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
two of them are quite expensive the uh
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
biological scientist in plant industry
 
00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
and your um assistant
 
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner that is that is correct um
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the one in plan industry is the one
 
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with in space invasive
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
species um when I became commissioner in
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
late 2017 it didn't well let me back up
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
a second when I became commissioner in
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
late 2017 the outgoing commissioner told
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
me that the department was in constant
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
triage mode we were just dealing with
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
things that really had to be dealt with
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
and I started looking at the Staffing it
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
didn't take me long to realize that I
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have the B with by myself to um
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
to deal with all of this and getting an
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner became a priority
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
but over the years in every budget
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
something else was a higher priority so
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that even last year just
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
before Christmas I looked at how many
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
days had I taken off last year and of
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
course I had fairs to cover in things I
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
was a net of eight days that I had been
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
away from the office other than if I was
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
at a a directly related at ated
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
conference um I did take off the 4 days
 
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
between Christmas and uh that that week
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
so I did get up to 12 days off um and
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
that was typical for the previous seven
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
years there's just too much work and the
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
fact is if I was out of the office um
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
for any a couple of days even at a
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
conference it was just
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
almost un unbelievable I'd really gotten
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
to the point where I said you know what
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
if I can't get an commissioner assistant
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner I really don't want to F do
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
another term um because it was
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
just too much um and so that's a very
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
important position and I I do want to
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
note to you even though you've looked at
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
what we've taken from General funds we
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
are a net positive to the general fund
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
every single
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
year we so we have those two funds where
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
25 and 50% go in and and fines and other
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
fees for plan industry and all these
 
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
places so when you look at what we
 
00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.269 align:start position:0%
places so when you look at what we
actually

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
spend we always return more money to the
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
general fund than we take so you know I
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
think that's an important thing and we I
 
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
want to continue to make sure that
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
happens okay so speaking of that are
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
there fines and fees that have been flat
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
for two decades or more you know that
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
yes there yes there are um and we do
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity um and of course this is
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
with this transition it hasn't been the
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh the best time to be looking at at
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
that some are in fees some are in in law
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
and we should be looking at that because
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
I very much believe that we are a
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
government that should be um driven by
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
fees and not taxes um and so in the
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
pesticides and in the uh regulatory
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
Services I've had my directors look at
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
at those and what it's costing us and
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
what other fees are we do have
 
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:04.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity um to increase those fees to
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
drive more revenue and I will tell you
 
00:29:08.909 --> 00:29:08.919 align:start position:0%
the one area that we just went live with
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
this animal database program um which
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
was years and it takes
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
$250,000 a year to
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
maintain I believe there should be a $5
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
fee for every cert uh certificate that
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
is entered into the system to pay for
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
that and when you think of that that's
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
nothing I don't think there's anybody
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
who is spending less than $5 a week
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
feeding the animals and so to have a
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
one-time fee um would bring us
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money and if the
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
60,000 um number is right then there's
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
$180,000 that we could bring in to pay
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
for for what we're doing 300 I yeah 300
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes no I had that I had that
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
300 I'm sorry I don't
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
yeah my math is usually better than that
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so we'll want to know if
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
there's certain ones of those that can
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
be in this budget right so yes please
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
work on that thank we will definitely do
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
that I'll be
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
back yes representative Ms thanks um
 
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
just two quick follow-ups from some
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
previous questions um if there if there
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
ever is a bird flu outbreak in New
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um does your do you make the
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
call on whether those birds need need to
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
be um euthanized the state veterinarian
 
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
does and if there is an outbreak they do
 
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
have to we have had a couple of small
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
outbreaks none this year but couple
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
years back in
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
rescues where they have birds and
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's Ducks turkeys whatever
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
and we have had to go in and we've had
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
to euthanize the birds in New Hampshire
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
there is a quarantine Zone um and so all
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
the bird movement of you know livestock
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
has to to be uh quarantined for a period
 
00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:02.519 align:start position:0%
of time in the particular sites that the
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
birds are destroyed on I think that they
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
can't bring up birds back on for 90 days
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
um and that does affect one well there
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
are two large poultry operations in the
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
state one is hubard Farms over in
 
00:31:19.149 --> 00:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
Walpole um and they were affected they
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
actually probably lost 3 million doll in
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
sales from their facility there because
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
of one of these small operations being
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the quarantine Zone um and the other
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
would be um Pete and Jerry's up in
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
Monroe they have depopulated their Farm
 
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
directly there because they bring in
 
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
millions of eggs to process into Monroe
 
00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:45.799 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and if they had the
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
quarantine there if they had bird flu
 
00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
there they would have to stop um the
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
distribution of eggs so those are our
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
our two big concerns are are those two
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
operations and the state veterinarian as
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
part of of your department yes okay um
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
second followup um on the on the fines
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
and the fees do you have the um do you
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
have the statutory authority to to
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
recommend increasing those fees and or
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
or do do you require legislation some we
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
would require legislation and certainly
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
the one I just talked about on the an
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
animal database would require
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
legislation couple of ours are in fees
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at moving forward um
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
with that and others again we would have
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
to do through the budget and and or
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
through legislation so potentially for
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
the animal database and for the others
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
um as we move forward we may be asking
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 2 um amendments to make
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
that happen because I know that revenues
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
are very uh very short these
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
days and uh I think those are
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate and some of them have not
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
been raised in you know 20 years or
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative evil yeah
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so um on the discussion of
 
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
thank you so um on the discussion of
Revenue

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
um maybe I've missed it here but uh I'm
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
assuming like all the other agencies
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
you've been asked to reduce your budget
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
by four or so percent and I wondered uh
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing to cut and the
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
direct impacts so my my first priority
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
was to maintain our Personnel because
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
we're already you know we're I don't
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
consider us to be in triage mode but we
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
do not have an excessive staff there are
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that the legislature has
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
asked us to do that we still can't get
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
to so that 4% um we have funds the cost
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
of care fund for that goes to um towns
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
who seiz animals that wasn't happening
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
because they had to care for them fund's
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
in pretty good shape so I've reduced
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
that to an average of about 20
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
$25,000 in the next BM each year we will
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
be fine there the one other is the fair
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
grants program that was started a few
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
years ago to help with Capital
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
Improvements again that's that's been
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
reduced I think that was at
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
150,000 that's been reduced to 20
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
25,000 the other was the land
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
preservation fund um which was being
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
funded at various levels again that down
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
to 20
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
25,000 we will have no new vehicles in
 
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
the next bium luckily our Fleet is in
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
pretty good shape I think we will be
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
okay with not having any new vehicles
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
but we normally
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
replace two or three bium I think that's
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
about right two or three um are again
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
we've gotten our it situation in pretty
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
good shape so we will not be looking at
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
any um
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
new laptops computers it's a relatively
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
minor amount but those were the the
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
first areas that that we went to um and
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we were able to
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
to complete the 4% Mission if you will
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
within that and because of our low
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
general fund demand the governor did not
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
ask for any further uh reductions from
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
us and again you know we are net revenue
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
state thank you representative leean
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman uh nice to see you
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner see you we heard a week or
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
so ago House Bill uh
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
246 which was um let's see the uh
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
Conservation District resilience grant
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
program for
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
$50,000 is there any reason that wasn't
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
put in your budget or what do you know
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
about that they're coming in at I yes I
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with the legislators
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
and with the districts on that um you
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
notice I was I was not at the hearing
 
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
you weren't at the hearing yeah because
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
given the reductions we were asked to
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
make in our budget I could not justify
 
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
supporting that I couldn't justify
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
putting that in my budget as a request
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's important but to make
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
those other cuts and to say oh yes but I
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
think this is a great idea uh I that's
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
not a message I I wanted to send I'm
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we might find other ways to
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
to fund it um I'm not sure that we can
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
there is another Federal program that
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
nobody has figured out including the
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
USDA at this point and I was on a call
 
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday for about an hour on it it's a
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
crop loss program for 23 and 24 crop
 
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
losses we covered most of those in in
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's a 200 million 200
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
million 220 million program for the
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
eight for the six New England states and
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
then Alaska and Hawaii we have no idea
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
what what's coming in we
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
requested um these 16 million that we
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
believe that was the crop loss but we've
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of that alth we looked at
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
it as terms of profitability so we
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
didn't cover all the actual crop loss
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
because I W in the program I was running
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
I had no intention of making profitable
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
Farms more profitable because a lot of
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
them pivoted we're hoping that we can
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
use some of these funds for climate
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
resiliency I'd rather see you know
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
irrigation projects um drainage projects
 
00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
because we keep going from one extreme
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
to the other one year you need a dra you
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
need drainage and the next year you need
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
water um more and so we're still unsure
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the FEDS are still unsure what will
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
be allowed and frankly I wouldn't be
 
00:37:38.109 --> 00:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
surprised if there was a pause on that
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
particular program all to Al together
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
but um it's something you know we have
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
requested there's a lot more money
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's been
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
requested even within the other five New
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
England states than the $220
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
million so I don't know what's going to
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
happen but if there was money that would
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
be available for something like that I
 
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
would look to see if we could do
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
something through that through that
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
funding source but I'm not sure we could
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I have a question um so do
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
you think that with the three
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
new um general fund
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
positions you will still be a net
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
positive contributor to yes we've had
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
those positions in place and we still
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
are net net positive uh and we'll
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
continue to do so and as I say I think
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
if we could get some fees that increased
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
and one established we could even be
 
00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
more net positive which is what I like
 
00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.430 align:start position:0%
more net positive which is what I like
to

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.470 align:start position:0%
to
see

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um you mentioned that
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things that the
 
00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
legislature has asked you to do that you
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
still aren't able to do so I ask you a
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
two-part question um first part is what
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
are those second part is which of those
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
do you think should could some of those
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
be eliminated or should they be
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
eliminated so my my thought were a limit
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh essentially to what we do with um
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of of feeds and foods that are
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
registered so there simply isn't enough
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
funding and time to actually send
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
everything out to a laboratory to have
 
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.349 align:start position:0%
everything out to a laboratory to have
those

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
analyzed we don't always get to do as
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
many inspections as we'd like
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
particularly in the area of pet vending
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
we're having a discussion I the staff
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
there is is right
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
now um really Fray and um I'm not sure
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
that that can be sustained so we're
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
going although the legislature doesn't
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
require us to go in and do inspections
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis for every pet vending
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
pet vendor we have been doing that we're
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
frankly we're not going to be able to do
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to really do a
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
sampling of everybody but looking at the
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
ones who have had
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful inspections
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh moving forward and there are a number
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
of those there it can be a very
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
difficult clientele to to work with um
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
we uh let's
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
see so I mean those those I didn't come
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
up with with a list we were doing um the
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh Organic certification we were
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
spending about 200,000 to bring 15,000
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
in and there were eight eight other
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
working within the state so we when we
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
stopped doing that we started doing one
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
thing that we hadn't been doing which
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
was seed
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
inspections uh we found that New
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was becoming a Dumping Ground
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
for expired
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
seed the total number of fines that we
 
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
issued to get their attentions after
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
giving them warnings and working with
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
them again we issued over a quarter
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
fines we collected over I think just
 
00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.589 align:start position:0%
fines we collected over I think just
about

00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in actual fines after working
 
00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
with these we found that seeds were
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
being moved around from store to store
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
we still didn't get in to everybody we
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
have other products that we are supposed
 
00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
to be inspecting but seeds seem to be
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
the the one that you know if you buy a
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
bag of grass seed and you put it on your
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
lawn and it doesn't come up you're
 
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
probably going to blame
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
yourself and that's probably not the
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
reason your seed hasn't been coming
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
up yeah so that's an area that we and we
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
were only able to do with really deal
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
with some of the big box stores last
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
year and because they were so difficult
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
to deal with that took up a huge amount
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
of time last year so we're we're finding
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
things that you know we
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
really had put on the Shelf such as the
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
um the feed and fertilizer testing and
 
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
um we getting back into those areas but
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
we s simply didn't have the staff to do
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
Griffin I forgot thank you Mr
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you commissioner for
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're welcome uh I
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
see that under the uh major accom
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
accomplishments in survey and mapping
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
1123 new records for invasive species I
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
I assume those are separate locations
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
yes how many invasive species are we
 
00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:33.190 align:start position:0%
yes how many invasive species are we
talking

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
about there are a lot I don't I don't
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
know that wasn't a question I prepared
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
myself for but you know there are a few
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
um obviously the bitter site the
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
knotweed tree of Heaven are the major
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
invasive plants that we're dealing with
 
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot a lot more um and
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
then of course on invas yeah that's what
 
00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
they're covering there and we have a lot
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
of invas invasive
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
bugs um we're dealing with and of course
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much decimated our um our
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
Elm not our Elm trees but our ash trees
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much wiped out in the state of
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at this point are we
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking 30 or 50 or 100 um there is a
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
there is a list probably on on our
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
website which probably
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
has somewhere near a 100 thank you there
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
are a lot that we are not allowing to
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
come into the state and they continue to
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
come in yes representative Ron thank you
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair um going back to your
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
comment about the expired seeds and
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
doing inspections um does your
 
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
department do any certification of
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
vendors or stores that have consistently
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
met the expectations of your department
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
that haven't had any violations or do
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
you do any um communication or put on
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
your website those vendors who are
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
violating that because I think the it
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be a public service for people to
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
know who who's a trusted vendor and who
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
isn't uh I think that's a good point and
 
00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079 align:start position:0%
we have had that discussion and this
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
year we were just trying to get through
 
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
um to them without going to that step
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
but I I think I think there is a is a
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
lot of Merit in doing that that's not
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
something that apartment has
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
historically done and and perhap perhaps
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
we should and I think we'll have some
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
more discussion we'll have some
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
discussions with the Department of
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
Justice about what they feel comfortable
 
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
with us doing because I would very much
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
like to be able to go out there and said
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
we've done an inspection of this store
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
and you know they met all the
 
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.349 align:start position:0%
and you know they met all the
requirements

00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:44.359 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
or you know we did an inspection and
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
they were in violation of of these areas
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
I think that's something that the
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
consumers would well be served by but
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
historically that's not been anything
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
that we have done yeah follow up Mr
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
chair um because I I do know there are
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
some nonprofit groups specifically New
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes which certifies um lawn
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
care companies uh so that people can use
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
their services knowing that they're not
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
using a fertilizer whatever that may
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
cause damage to the environment you know
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
like runoff or something like that that
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
would hurt a lake so I I would um
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
support that 100% plus it's giving the
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
consumer I mean the work you're doing is
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
really to protect the consumer and it
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
I think that information would be really
 
00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
helpful to them thank you thank
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
you that was a quick hearing yeah it's
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
it was almost a housekeeping bill so H
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
representative eil just um from what
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying it sounds like the depart
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
your department was in what I would call
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
a functionality hole you were really
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
struggling to keep up with your
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so the staff changes
 
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
really aren't a lot of additives what
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
they are is it fair to say what you've
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
done is finally pull the department to a
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
point where it can perform the functions
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
that uh it's being asked to perform yes
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
and that was that was my goal when I
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
came into
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
office um and started
 
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
getting a handle on things one of the
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
first things I realized is that we had
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
38 authorized full-time positions only
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
32 two of them were filled and none of
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
them were
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
advertised and I realized very it took
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
me a while to realize what was going on
 
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
which was we were consistently
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
overestimating our
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
revenues and so in order to meet the
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
lapses we weren't hiring people so the
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
first thing I did to other than correct
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
that in the first budget was say okay
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
well they can impeach me if they'd like
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
if I don't put in the lapses but we're
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
going to advertise the positions and so
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
we got up to full Staffing and then I
 
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
was able to identify the shortcomings
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
the the only area that I identify as a
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
shortcoming right now is in the area of
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
the pet vending Maine for instance has
 
00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:11.720 align:start position:0%
eight full-time people in their pet
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
vending we don't have anybody dedicated
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
to that I added one person um to pet to
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
the animal industry uh early on uh and
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
that's clearly not enough now that we
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
are having have a handle when we have
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
the database and I and I told finance
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
and everyone at the time that until that
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
system was up and running I would have
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
no idea what our actual needs were um
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've only been required for everybody
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be reporting the certificates for
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
transfer since uh January 7th so I still
 
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a full handle on how many
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
people are out there who are
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
transferring animals in excess of the
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
limit um without a
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
license uh we're we're going to get a
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
handle on that um and and we'll see what
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
our real needs are and then the
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
legislature can decide whether we want
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
to change the statute or fund the
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
department but right now I'll tell you
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
it is not fair to the individuals in
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
that in that uh division because they're
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
not able to do what they're supposed to
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
impossible so you're talking about
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
division of animal industry population
 
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:26.870 align:start position:0%
division of animal industry population
yes

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
course if you could find somebody else
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
who would like to take pet vending we'd
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
somebody further questions seeing none
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much commissioner I guess
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
we'll see you fairly shortly when we get
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
the house bill one yes yes all right
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah all right we we'll we'll let's take
 
00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
a a five minute break or so um I'll go
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
wer

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:55.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:25.549 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.559 --> 00:51:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
all right I see everybody in their seat
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
246 uh
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
FNA and um
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
let's is there any discussion of this
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill let's start with
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
that I'm not seeing much all right so so
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
how about if I recognize uh
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
representative cells for a motion yes
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to make a
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
motion to retain House Bill 246 FNA all
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
right is there a second I'll second it
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
second by representative eel all right
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
if the clerk is ready we any discussion
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
motion no so just in general I mean we
 
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
we still don't know what how much money
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
we have to fund these kind of things
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
typically what we do is um if we if we
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
fund them we make them part of House
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
Bill too and so that's what I think is
 
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
the Committees um has in mind for this
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
one all right um the clerk can call the
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
role Mr chairman would you like to go
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
first or last on the roll call um I
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%

having said that it's I believe this to
 
00:54:54.789 --> 00:54:54.799 align:start position:0%
be a worthy worthy effort and a worthy
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
project and I think that
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
at this moment it's something that we
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
need to look at a little bit down the
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
road once we know we have the funding
 
00:55:02.319 --> 00:55:03.069 align:start position:0%

bill yeah and I seem to remember
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%

names on the on the blue sheet and then
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%

House Bill 97
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
and um I understand that um Miss Rollins
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
has some uh information for us
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
about what monies have been spent in
 
00:57:37.119 --> 00:57:38.150 align:start position:0%
about what monies have been spent in
this

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
area for this coming by any so I did
 
00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:43.510 align:start position:0%
area for this coming by any so I did
just

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
want I did just want to know um in this
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
the area of Wastewater and State uh
 
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
state aid that the uh Dees does budget
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
what is needed for for the current state
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
aid um projects that they've have
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
already have awarded which they did do
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
in their budget one thing that is a
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
little bit different this session um
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
that hasn't occurred in the past is that
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh last budget there was $15 million
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
appropriated to this fund for 26 and 27
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
additionally so that's a little bit
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
different than what typically occurs
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill so I just thought we
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
should note that there was funds put in
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
here and then you can decide further if
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
you want to add a additional funds via
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
this bill gotcha all right any other
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Ms then
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative e so I get I I'm I guess
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused so there was
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's in in the in hb2 that was
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
introduced in
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
23 there was money for the bium that
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
we're in now plus the B the 2526
 
00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:57.039 align:start position:0%
bium so there was
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
the I'll start off with your first
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
question for hb2 there was money
 
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
appropriated outside of that bium which
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different as you know
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
than we typically do we typically do
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
legislature typically appropriates
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
monies within the current bium so there
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
was funds put in for the 26 and 27
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
budget of 15 million for each
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
year so if this bill were to
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
pass as is
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
would that mean we'd have $30 million
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
allocated to this fund that for this
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
year that would be correct what I do
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
think in we could do which I do have a
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
question out to Dees is get a little bit
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
of clarification whether that 30 million
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass would be all
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
for new grants and if that 15 million
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
that passed in the prior budget for each
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
bium if that was already for existing
 
00:59:54.599 --> 00:59:59.270 align:start position:0%
bium if that was already for existing
grants

00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
say that all right let's let's have
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative eil and then
 
01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative Wier um thank you Mr
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
chair this actually is I'm curious
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
whether someone in the audience can
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
answer this question um it was my
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that the EPA
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
was talking about issuing a rule that
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
was going to require uh wastewater
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
treatment plants to treat the water that
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
was released after processing I know
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
there's the process where you have the
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
sludge and the Wastewater um and at this
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
point it's my understanding that uh the
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
waste water that's being released to The
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
Rivers is being monitored but not
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
treated for instance for pasas and I
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
just wondered if you knew anything about
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
the status of that
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
rule because it would affect uh
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
obviously upgrade necessities and things
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
of that nature for wastewater treatment
 
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
yourself hello okay hi everyone my name
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
is Tracy wood I am the administrator for
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater engineering Bureau at New
 
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.069 align:start position:0%
the Wastewater engineering Bureau at New
Hampshire

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:01:19.950 --> 01:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
Dees and as far as pasas is concerned in
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility nip these
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
permits so that's a point source
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
discharge to a surface water there are
 
01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:32.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring requirements for pasas that
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
is currently in those permits um the
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
majority of them um the medium
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facility General
 
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
permit is about to come out and that'll
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
include 21 facilities that will now have
 
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
those requirements as well so EPA is
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
adding the requirements as permits are
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
issued some permits have had the
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for quite some time but
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
they were actually waiting for a method
 
01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
to be developed to actually test for p
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
in Wastewater and now that they have a
 
01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
method EPA sent out a letter in the
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
fall I think it was the fall summer fall
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
telling them that you'd have to start
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
monitoring in
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
the last quarter state quarter of
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
calendar year so it was October to
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
December that they had to start
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring in 2024 so we actually just
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
got our first set of results because
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
those are due January 15th so they're
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
just starting to Monitor and the focus
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
for Wastewater is really on Source
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
reduction it's it's going to be very
 
01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
costly and and economically in feasible
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
to probably treat all Wastewater
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
effluent for pasas so we really need to
 
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
get it at the source and look at also
 
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
industrial pre-treatment so Source
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
reduction industrial
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment so um
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
let's H you want to follow up yeah just
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
really quickly so I well first of all so
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is we should stop
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
using it in the products that we're
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
using absolutely so just
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
quickly um I just my my question I just
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
want to be clear on what you're saying
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
the nipy permits as they're coming out
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
they're requiring wastewater treatment
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
plants to monitor but at this point
 
01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that the waste
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
water be treated before release for ass
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
or what else whatever else cuz I've been
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
at a couple of conferences where the EPA
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
was talking about issuing a treatment
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
rule which would cause a lot of expense
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
for the plants right well well drinking
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
water definitely has to be treated you
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
know because you don't want to be
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
drinking that um Wastewater is the other
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
end and they haven't um required
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
treatment as of yet um the wastewater
 
01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:52.349 align:start position:0%
treatment as of yet um the wastewater
treatment

01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
facilities have issues more basic than P
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
fast they're they're aging um you know
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
the Clean Water Act was 50 years ago
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
we've had some communities that have
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
done really well and kept up and built
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
new treatment plants we also have a lot
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
of communities that haven't done that
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
and are in dire straight now and they're
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
getting you know permits that are more
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
stringent they may have Metals limits
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
they may have nutrients limits and their
 
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure just can't meet
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
that um we also have what we're seeing
 
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.269 align:start position:0%
that um we also have what we're seeing
is

01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
is communities that have let their
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
capacity go you know they could have a
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
permitted capacity I'm just going to say
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
like a half a million gallons a day but
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
over the years they've let that capacity
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
go for various reasons they could have
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
had a lagoon facility and they just
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
decided to close off one of the cells
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have the Monies to
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
remove the sledge so now they're looking
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
at you know they half of the capacity
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
that they were that they're allow to
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
discharge are rated for and they're not
 
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
there so they're dealing with huge
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
issues um and past emerging contaminant
 
01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
is is just one of the issues okay thank
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
you we we're not really in a public
 
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
hearing mode here so it's just to answer
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
questions if they come up um and
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative wer and then
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative R isn't this money
 
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.430 align:start position:0%
representative R isn't this money
federal

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
funds which money the 15 million and the
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
15 million that are in this bill wasn't
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
this a Federal grant this is a a state
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
aid grant Pro it's called the state aid
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
grant program so the monies are coming
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
from the state from the state M this is
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
uh the Returns on loans and so on this
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
is actually monies provided by the state
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
from the general funds and it's on
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
principal and interest payments on
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
already completed Wastewater
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects thank you you're
 
01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
welcome so this area does have federal
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
funds and other all these other kind of
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
things as well as these General funds
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
they can actually yes well do they have
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
federal funds in my Bureau we have
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
What's called the Clean Water srf
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
program and we get Federal cap grants
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
each year there's a revolving piece to
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
that I will just say when we solicited
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
for projects in
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
2024 um we had over $650 Million worth
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
of requests I had about 10% % of that to
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
give out there's a huge need for our
 
01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
communities and we just we we can't do
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
it um and what we do is we're funding
 
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
those funds are for the project UPF
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
front and we're allowed to give so much
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
subsidy to each Project based on what
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
the feds allow us to give based on the
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
cap Grant requirements and so we right
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
now we have with the bill funding some
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
different pots of money coming in and
 
01:06:52.829 --> 01:06:52.839 align:start position:0%
they all have different requirements and
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're all giving about different
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
amount of subsidy so we take all those
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
pots of money and we put them make soup
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
and we decide like how can we give this
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
money out to communities and in 2024 our
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
subsidy range from 10% to
 
01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.430 align:start position:0%
subsidy range from 10% to
35%

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
35%
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
so you know on a $2 million project if a
 
01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
if a community is lucky to get 25%
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
subsidy that becomes a $15 million
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
project and what they're looking for is
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
can we get additional funds because $15
 
01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
million is still too expensive for them
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's where the state aid grant
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
program comes in interesting so was
 
01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative rung and then represented
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
month thank you Mr chair um how much is
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the fund
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
currently the the state aid grant fund
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
right it's been a complicated funding we
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
call sag The Saga because it has been
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
funded intermittently over the years and
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'll I can get to that the the big issue
 
01:07:56.789 --> 01:07:56.799 align:start position:0%
is is that when
 
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
communities put forth a multi-year
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar project these
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
aren't small projects these are Big
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
projects for communities they have to
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
put forth a warant article to put before
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
their their Community to vote on and so
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
when they do that what they're looking
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
for at that point in time is a
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
commitment are there monies there for us
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
what can we count on and we haven't been
 
01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
able to tell them that you can count on
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
sag because it's subject to funding um
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
and so what they're looking for is to
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
know that the monies are going to be
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
there when they make a
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
commitment in four years and five years
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the point of the bill
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's put forward is they're putting
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
forth that they want to see the program
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
level funded so that it's not only for
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
maintenance payments but there's going
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
to be monies there for new
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
Awards in four to five years so how can
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
they get that security I'm not sure okay
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
leave that that's the funding is your is
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have money some money's there
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
um I can tell about what was
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated so you'll hear the 27.9 was
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the 2023 session that
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
was hb2 chap
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
79 and that was for maintenance payments
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and new Awards and
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
non-lps um we have estimated in 24 and
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
25 we will use about
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
21.5 million of that and that we would
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
have some monies remaining um for new
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
grants I'm sorry what was the how much
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
did you say you have remaining we would
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
and then in this budget what we had Dees
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
had asked for was 10.2 million and about
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
9.7 million that was fiscal year 26 and
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
27 and that was just for maintenance
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
payments through the end of fiscal year
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
24 so not including new Awards we're
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
going to be making this year so maybe
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
we'll ask the LBA to create us a table
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
that shows for the the past five or more
 
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
years what's how much has come into the
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
fund how much has been expended to by
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
the fund and so on right so you know a
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
kind of accounting of this fund and
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
what's planned for already in law has
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
been spent to add to it next year can I
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
just all right one one more from
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
represent R okay and and then while
 
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
you're here I just want to ask how many
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
what percentage of wastewater treatment
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
plants in New Hampshire are tertiary and
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I would say the majority are not
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
tertiary the majority are
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
secondary um we have a a handful that
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
are tertiary they're the the newest
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
plants that have been built like
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
Portsmith Pierce island exiter um that
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
are meeting um the Great Bay total
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
nitrogen General permit those facilities
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
that have upgraded um and then what was
 
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
your I'm sorry what was your other
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
question do they all discharge into
 
01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
Riverway oh the majority of Wastewater
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
Municipal wastewater treatment plants do
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
discharge through a nip permit we do
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
have a few that have groundwater
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
discharge permits and that's mostly due
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
to uh where they are in terrain and they
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
just don't have a river nearby for them
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
to discharge into so they have to go
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
into the ground through like a rapid
 
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.229 align:start position:0%
into the ground through like a rapid
infiltration

01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
Basin all right representative Ms thank
 
01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
you um during during the testimony on
 
01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
this bill I thought I heard that without
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
this funding being available without
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
this 15 million being
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
available um we would not be able to tap
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
into 600 million of federal funding is
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
that is that correct that you know that
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is the state match required by the
 
01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.030 align:start position:0%
this is the state match required by the
federal

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
programs this is not the state match for
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
the Clean Water srf programs okay this
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
is the separate state aid grant program
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
which is the after the fact grant
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
program where new applications come in
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
for completed projects but again I want
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
to reiterate communities are looking
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
when they put forth a warrant article
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
and they have a project that's not going
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be completed for 3 to five years that
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
the monies are going to be there that's
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
the important piece of this and they're
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
looking for security that the monies are
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
going to be there I don't know how you
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
do that with a bi Anyan budget unless
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
you appropriate funds that are for new
 
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
Awards only and are non lapsing so that
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
the there's a pot of money there that
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
they know is there for
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
them all right representative evil thank
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um one thing when you were
 
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
discussing the situation and the
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
condition of many of our wastewater
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
treatment plants it struck me is you're
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
that you said some of them are having to
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
close cell they're losing
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
capacity um I've heard in my own area
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges with housing is
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure support and I think we
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
can draw a pretty straight line
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
between uh Wastewater and Sewer
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
capacity um to
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
housing could you comment on that I I
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
certainly can there's there's a
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
huge um it's a direct connection ction
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know and you can't if the if a
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant doesn't have
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
capacity you obviously can't add new
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
connections because they just don't have
 
01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
capacity we're seeing it in communities
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
every day where you know we want to put
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
in Workforce housing but the
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is not there and it they
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
want it there immediately and these
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
projects are not immediate projects it
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
takes years to plan design and construct
 
01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
these wastewater treatment plants so
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
the a stable source of funding for these
 
01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
projects would be very helpful to propel
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
them forward knowing that communities
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
knowing that they have a funding
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
structure that they can count on will
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
forward thank you for coming and I'm

representative eel to retain house bill
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
197 so uh shall we discuss this I mean
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's something I know most of the
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
members are very familiar with from last
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
year or the year before that you know
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
Etc um anyone else anyone like
 
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative R well as a disclaimer
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor on this bill and last
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
night I spent several hours at a school
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
district budget committee meeting and
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
our property taxes are just
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
unsustainable it's pitting neighbor
 
01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
against neighbor and when you go back
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
and look at the history of how we fund
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
education at the local level prior to
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
2013 I think when the state contributed
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
more to the retirement
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
pension for the most part people could
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
handle it they could handle most of the
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
funding come from local property taxes
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
but it's not that's not true anymore and
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
we need to provide relief to our our
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
property tax to our communities and this
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
is a way of helping out um we've seen
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
increased costs across the board for
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
some reason staff expect races every
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
year um health insurance is an important
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
compensation to employees and we've seen
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
just in miramac those premiums went up
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
they've been going up over
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
10% um there's so many issues and we
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to be a state that drives out
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
residents from our communities because
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
they can't afford the prod property tax
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
so I think anything we can do at the
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
state to help those
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
communities um we should we should pass
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm in favor of this
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
bill other
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
wler we have to um do a tight budget we
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
have to be able to tell everybody this
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
is all you can
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
spend this is a loose end you can't
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
control what the spending will be you're
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
just going to commit yourself to
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
75% and when we took it out of the
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
budget in 13 it or 12 11 and 12 was
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
because it was too unpredictable and it
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
had already gone up considerably in the
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
previous years don't forget when this
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
thing was first invented there weren't
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
that many uh Town employees as they're
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
every year they're increasing so we
 
01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how many towns are going to
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
add employees that didn't add them
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
before that are give going to give big
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
pay raises and this commits us to adding
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
s half% to all those increases we have
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
no idea what it will be over these 27
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
months going forward and the other thing
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
I point out this is not going to make a
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
wrinkle in your property taxes you look
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
back to 2023 we took a hundred million
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
off of Statewide education property
 
01:19:15.629 --> 01:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
taxes and send it back to the towns and
 
01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
said here's a big reduction in the
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
property tax it should have amounted to
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
a couple hundred dollars per per uh
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if there's 500 th000
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers nobody even saw it it got
 
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
together with people do you see a tax
 
01:19:34.510 --> 01:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
decrease in 2023 no no no what
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
happened this would not make a bit of
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
difference in property taxes what we've
 
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
got to do is control School spending if
 
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
we're worried about property taxes not
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
this contribution this is this is not a
 
01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
good idea because it's a loose end thank
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
you others representative mths thank you
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I um I I I agree with
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
everything that representative rung said
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
and and and the only thing that I would
 
01:20:04.629 --> 01:20:04.639 align:start position:0%
add is we heard during testimony that um
 
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh from from representative Mark bone
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
from eping that if this were to this
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
were to pass it would um provide
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
$780,000 to the eping school district
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
which would allow them then to pay the
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
full cost of the contract that they are
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
considering for their teach
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
without having to increase property
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
taxes so it will have an impact a
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
positive impact on um on on
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts and
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
um you know for all the reasons that
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative rung mentioned I uh I
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
also believe that we need to move
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:48.679 align:start position:0%
this thank you others no okay um I'll
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
just throw my own two cents
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
in to me one of the worst aspects of of
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
government funding
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
structure is the the way we say to
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
people if you spend a dollar I'll give
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
you 20% right I I'll give you 20 cents
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing right that's just an
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to spend more than you would
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise right it's just like when you
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
when you go to buy go to the store and
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
you buy something on sale right they
 
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
they say you know uh you buy a chicken
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
25% off well guess what that cause
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
causes a lot more sales of chicken than
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
it would otherwise same thing here if we
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
say to somebody if you spend X I'll give
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
you some percentage of it and the
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
federal government does this all the
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
time it's just an incentive to spend
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
more now the way the right way in my
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
opinion to subsidize is more like what
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
we do with adequate education if you
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a kid we give you X doll right
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
there's no nobody can change what sort
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
of kids they have they either have them
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
or they don't right and so it's not an
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
incentive to somehow spend more it's an
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
incentive it's it's a it's an assist on
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
what they do spend right so that's the
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
right way to subsidize this in my
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
opinion is the wrong way so all right so
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
I guess we we're missing one person but
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
I go yeah okay to a hearing
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative leean yes uh just kind of
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
a followup Mr chairman I think it's
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
important to point out that we're facing
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
what could be a $500 million deficit and
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
this bill alone in the first year cost
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
28 million so it would be a concern of
 
01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
mine carrying this forward with knowing
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
that we have such a huge deficit to face
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
but absolutely all right um if I there's
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
no further discussion the clerk can call
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.590 --> 01:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman on the motion on
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%

01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
we break up on
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
scheduling um so uh here's our plans for
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
what what's going forward we're getting
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
into the busy season so we're going to
 
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
hear the governor's budget address on
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
February 13th the that's a Thursday in
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
house session and then she'll be coming
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
to house finance the next day
 
01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day in the afternoon so
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have a couple hours with her
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
to to talk about the details of the
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
budget and so um then the following
 
01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
Monday is a
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
holiday and um our general plan for this
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
division is to basically have Tuesdays
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
off because I'm um with represent of
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
Earth and papa Müller we uh I'm on the
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh education funding committee so we're
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
going to dedicate Tuesdays to that so
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
this committee will meet essentially
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
from that point
 
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.470 align:start position:0%
from that point
forward

01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
um Wednesday any Thursday that's
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
available that's not a house session day
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
Friday and and then and Mondays so um so
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
that week the we'll meet here here on
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
Wednesday the 20th I think it is um the
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
19th is it the 19th it's the 19th okay
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
so we'll meet Wednesday the 19th we'll
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
meet uh Friday the 21st because I think
 
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
uh Thursday is a house session day right
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
and then the following week we'll meet
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh Monday Wednesday Thursday Friday
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
because that Thursday is not a house
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
session day but Monday
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
no Monday we're not meeting Tuesday
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
right so we'll meet Monday Wednesday
 
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
Thursday Friday as a division so that's
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
six days left in this month to meet
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%

01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
typically have it in this room is
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
um to kind of we're going to get into
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
house bill one for all of our agencies
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
right so um and uh go through all the
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
line by line stuff and and um there may
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
be a little of that left over it sounds
 
01:26:43.790 --> 01:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
like into March but then we'll get into
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 sections in March and any
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
further bills that we may have um are
 
01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
you planning any full committee hearings
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.239 --> 01:27:05.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:27:05.149 --> 01:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay so can
 
01:27:11.229 --> 01:27:11.239 align:start position:0%
we but are you planning any full
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
committee public I guess we everything
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
we got now is second committee right so
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have one bill that
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't had a car late I'm sorry Mr chair
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to have a full
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
will that be March or that you're going
 
01:27:28.189 --> 01:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
to try to do that in February most of
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
the deadlines we have on bills
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
March inch okay so so the first week of
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
March maybe we'll finish up that your
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill um and maybe there's some others
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know have a full Committee hearing
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
that week um we'll finish up any house
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill one stuff we have and then start
 
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
getting into um how Bill too but just in
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
general I'll try not to schedule any
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
division one stuff on Tuesdays so
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
that'll be our day off okay any comments
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative leean thanks Mr chairman
 
01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
so you know from our past experience
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we generally need almost every day
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
of the week to get through the budget
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
and why is Tuesday a complete day off I
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
guess I missed that so that's because
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm assigned to the I and and
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative Earth and papa Mohler
 
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
have been assigned to the education
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
funding committee so that's the one day
 
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
that they're going to said Wednesday or
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
something too but no just Tuesday just
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesday right and that so anytime
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to have an exact session
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be a
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
Tuesday right so that's that's kind of
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
what we're doing they're actually going
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
to meet they've been meeting we've been
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
meeting um Tuesday and
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
Friday but I'm going to have to move
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
move Fridays to here right so is there
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
any reason we couldn't have
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell Serv as chair un
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
those Tuesdays and not make a decision
 
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
unless you're here or I just just
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
knowing about the future of this we are
 
01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
like so book solid for four to five
 
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
weeks so we have to be here every day in
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
order to get through the budget and
 
01:29:18.149 --> 01:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
having a complete day off like Tuesday
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
could be you know could be a problem
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
I mean it's been done before yeah yeah
 
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's where we're meeting five
 
01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
days a week you know so all right well
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
why don't we try it for
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
February and then see how it goes okay
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
because I have complete faith in
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell I
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand representative evil I mean
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it true that a lot of the
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
Ed funding bills are first committee
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
bills that are then subsequently coming
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
to so Finance I mean do you think that
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
your uh agenda there or schedule there
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
will lighten up a little
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
bit absolutely yes so so the deadline
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
for early bills is March
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
6th right so I do think that Tuesday the
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
first Tuesday in March probably will be
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of exact stuff over there so
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
things might lighten up for you then a
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
little yes yes yeah right exactly so I
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
may not have to be there at all after
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
March 6th right or next to anyway that's
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
crunch time yes exactly it is okay so
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
that's our current plan we'll we'll
 
01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:38.719 align:start position:0%
figure it out so so plan to be
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
here uh essentially every day after
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
starting on the
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
13th except for Tuesdays okay all right
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
all right and we'll see you at 1:15
 
01:30:52.920 --> 01:31:22.910 align:start position:0%
all right and we'll see you at 1:15

03:48:51.149 --> 03:48:51.159 align:start position:0%
on what the statutory obligations are of
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
the department and include our mission
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
vision and core values I know you'll
 
03:48:55.960 --> 03:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
vision and core values I know you'll
read

03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:49:00.110 --> 03:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
those on page four is a highlevel
 
03:49:03.389 --> 03:49:03.399 align:start position:0%
organizational chart um then we go into
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
page five we have a total of three
 
03:49:08.269 --> 03:49:08.279 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities one secure
 
03:49:09.910 --> 03:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit that also has a
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
residential treatment unit we have one
 
03:49:14.429 --> 03:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
transitional work center uh out of a
 
03:49:16.469 --> 03:49:16.479 align:start position:0%
security secure perimeter for the men
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
the transitional work Center for Women
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
is within the secure perimeter of the
 
03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire correctional facility for
 
03:49:23.149 --> 03:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
women and we continue to have three
 
03:49:25.030 --> 03:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
transitional housing units one in
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester for men uh two in conquered
 
03:49:30.269 --> 03:49:30.279 align:start position:0%
one for men and one for women for the
 
03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
main three could you give us the
 
03:49:34.269 --> 03:49:34.279 align:start position:0%
capacity I believe those are on the
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
chart you want the this is the current
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
population if you want the capacity the
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
design capacity I'll get that to you yep
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
03:49:47.950 --> 03:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh on page seven I think it's important
 
03:49:49.870 --> 03:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
to share what the current resident
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
population data demonstrates the uh
 
03:49:55.229 --> 03:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
total in custody is
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
1,925 as of January 1 2025 obviously
 
03:50:01.389 --> 03:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
that number fluctuates we continue to
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
have uh other individuals has at a state
 
03:50:05.790 --> 03:50:05.800 align:start position:0%
for multiple security reasons that
 
03:50:07.590 --> 03:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
numberers range anywhere from the number
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here 166 to as high as 200
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
it hasn't fluctuated significantly in
 
03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
the time that I've been with the
 
03:50:13.199 --> 03:50:14.750 align:start position:0%
the time that I've been with the
Department

03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
Department
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
we've included the minimum sentence
 
03:50:19.149 --> 03:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
structure uh by sentence length and
 
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
maximum sentence structure by sentence
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
length I always like to point out that's
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
for the sentences they're serving at the
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
time of the report uh this data can't
 
03:50:29.429 --> 03:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
take into consideration con uh
 
03:50:31.229 --> 03:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
consecutive sentences when we look at it
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
so there is some marginal difference uh
 
03:50:36.590 --> 03:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
what we will and I will tell you the
 
03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
minimum and maximum sentences are rising
 
03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
through the course of my time in 20
 
03:50:42.510 --> 03:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
years it used to be an average of three
 
03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
and a half to 7 it's now closer to 5 to
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
10 uh I think that uh is easily
 
03:50:50.910 --> 03:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
explained in the types of offenses that
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
people are being incarcerated for and
 
03:50:54.149 --> 03:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's because we have a higher number of
 
03:50:57.189 --> 03:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who are incarcerated for uh
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
crimes such as aggravated fonia seexual
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
assault and fonia sexual assault and so
 
03:51:04.790 --> 03:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
they are accordingly uh receiving higher
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
sentences on page eight start to show
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
you uh more demographics by age uh
 
03:51:14.110 --> 03:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
self-reported race and uh very high
 
03:51:17.070 --> 03:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
type as you can see crimes against
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
person is the highest
 
03:51:24.149 --> 03:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
rate and those include again the crimes
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned and other more
 
03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:27.389 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned and other more
significant

03:51:27.389 --> 03:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
crimes on page nine uh showing you a
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
trend of population by month U and then
 
03:51:37.389 --> 03:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
it includes Admissions and what we call
 
03:51:40.349 --> 03:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
releases or bookings and releases the
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
average number of releases is decreasing
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
which means we are booking about the
 
03:51:47.229 --> 03:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
same number of people into incarceration
 
03:51:49.990 --> 03:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
a month but we're not releasing uh the
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
same number so our population is
 
03:51:54.910 --> 03:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
climbing a little bit um I have an audit
 
03:51:57.149 --> 03:51:57.159 align:start position:0%
occurring just to understand the root of
 
03:51:59.469 --> 03:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
that uh change and so when I get that
 
03:52:01.229 --> 03:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
information I'll certainly share that
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
with the committee because I think it
 
03:52:04.030 --> 03:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
helps us understand the populations
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
we're managing New Hampshire in
 
03:52:07.950 --> 03:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
comparison to other states we're not
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
seeing what other states are
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
experiencing other states are
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
experiencing significant rises in
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated populations ours is is a
 
03:52:17.429 --> 03:52:17.439 align:start position:0%
bit static which is good um so we're
 
03:52:19.269 --> 03:52:19.279 align:start position:0%
balanced from that
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
perspective um and then I have gender
 
03:52:22.830 --> 03:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
breakdowns on that page as well we
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
continue to have a much smaller number
 
03:52:26.469 --> 03:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
of women incarcerated at the state
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
correction system than
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
men on page 10 I'll move on and I'm very
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
proud of what this organization has done
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
because part of the balance of providing
 
03:52:38.229 --> 03:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
Safety and Security is also providing
 
03:52:39.990 --> 03:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
treatment and Rehabilitation and of
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
course we want to reduce reincarceration
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
when that's appropriate when I took uh
 
03:52:47.229 --> 03:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
the lead of the organization in
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
2018 to date we've reduced our uh
 
03:52:53.149 --> 03:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate from 48% to down uh to
 
03:52:55.389 --> 03:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
approximately 40% so that's an 8%
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
decrease in people returning to
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration and try to give you
 
03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
literally a road map of the things that
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
we've implemented over time uh about how
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
that on page 11 uh one of the challenges
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
I adopted when I took over as
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner was uh the case loads uh in
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
our probation and parole service were
 
03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly High um I spent a lot of time
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh trying to adjust that uh the national
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh standard is 1 to 50 in an average
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
case load and 1 to 35 when it's a
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
specialty case load uh so I'm trying to
 
03:53:32.750 --> 03:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually show you the proportion of
 
03:53:34.670 --> 03:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
people on probation and parole the
 
03:53:36.750 --> 03:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
number of officers we have the types of
 
03:53:39.349 --> 03:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
supervision and where they're located on
 
03:53:39.359 --> 03:53:40.750 align:start position:0%
supervision and where they're located on
page

03:53:40.750 --> 03:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
11 and then I have more detail for you
 
03:53:46.349 --> 03:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
on page 12 where I give you the actual
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
addresses and supervision case load of
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
those probation appro offices associated
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
with our Field Services
 
03:53:55.229 --> 03:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
Division could you explain that you said
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's 50 per officer m is that right and
 
03:54:01.149 --> 03:54:01.159 align:start position:0%
and where would I see what we're
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually doing on page 13 sir headed
 
03:54:06.189 --> 03:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
right there story
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
continues um so again uh talking about
 
03:54:12.189 --> 03:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh when I took over an fy17 at the top
 
03:54:15.070 --> 03:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
of the page reading right to left so
 
03:54:17.790 --> 03:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
left being current right being the
 
03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
longest time ago we averaged about 1 to
 
03:54:23.710 --> 03:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
94 we're now about 1 to 54 and some of
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
that is uh literally repurposing other
 
03:54:27.910 --> 03:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement positions and creating
 
03:54:30.349 --> 03:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
new probation parole officers to help
 
03:54:33.149 --> 03:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
equalize those specialty case loads um
 
03:54:34.910 --> 03:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
and then to our benefit we've also seen
 
03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
a reduction in people on probation and
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
parole in the state so we've had a
 
03:54:40.830 --> 03:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
two-pronged effort and try to bring that
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
forward um the other uh implications uh
 
03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
was looking at our Fleet Management and
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
field services when I came on they had
 
03:54:51.630 --> 03:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
19 Vehicles we through the state process
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
have increased that to 25 our first
 
03:54:55.950 --> 03:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
Target was to take any office that had
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
one vehicle and get them a second
 
03:55:00.030 --> 03:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle so they could do those infield
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
visits and now we're leaning in uh to
 
03:55:05.030 --> 03:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
our larger case load offices and looking
 
03:55:07.750 --> 03:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
to see if we can deploy more resources
 
03:55:09.590 --> 03:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
to help them be in the field and I I see
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative muns has a question yes
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative muns thank you Mr chair
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for U taking my question um
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the reduction in case loads is is
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
very impressive um can but can you can
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
you give me any sense as to what the
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
kind of industry best practice is in
 
03:55:30.349 --> 03:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
terms of what case loads should be
 
03:55:32.349 --> 03:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
certainly uh again the industry standard
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
nationally is 1 to 50 if it's a
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
35 yeah meaning drug cord or something
 
03:55:44.830 --> 03:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
like that meaning drug Court sir or
 
03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
veterans court or mental health court
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
those those tend to be wanting down to 1
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
to 35 so is this because uh people are
 
03:55:55.710 --> 03:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
spending less time on probation and
 
03:55:57.870 --> 03:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
getting off sooner or what's why is this
 
03:56:00.429 --> 03:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
big reduction yeah there's a the hampire
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
should be proud we're ranked number one
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
both in safety and Corrections and
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's because our crime rate is
 
03:56:08.469 --> 03:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
decreased uh versus other states cross
 
03:56:10.389 --> 03:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
the country and our population has
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
decreased so some of it is all of the
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
effort for the last decade the states
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
invested in both specialty courts and
 
03:56:19.469 --> 03:56:19.479 align:start position:0%
other diversion activities are um just
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
individuals are not committing as many
 
03:56:23.910 --> 03:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
crimes um and we're really looking at
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
things on the reintegration or reducing
 
03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
recidivism side to make these things um
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
really balanced it takes everyone's
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
effort in the justice system in the
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
community mental health system uh in the
 
03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
housing uh area to really start to
 
03:56:40.030 --> 03:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
effectuate this change in our
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
state so are you're saying these are not
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
these 4,000 people are not ones that
 
03:56:49.149 --> 03:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
served three years and now they're out
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
on probation as much as people who are
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
sentenced to probation is that right or
 
03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
both some of both they're both yep so
 
03:56:59.110 --> 03:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
the 4,025 is a combination of both
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
probation and parole on uh page 11 I
 
03:57:05.030 --> 03:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
break out the probation and parole cases
 
03:57:07.469 --> 03:57:07.479 align:start position:0%
for you by men and women so if you look
 
03:57:09.550 --> 03:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
at this chart
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
here you'll see them broken
 
03:57:16.429 --> 03:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
out yes representative evil could you
 
03:57:18.429 --> 03:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
clarify for us the difference between
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
probation and parole happy to do that
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
probation is a court ordered supervision
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
time you serve on probation is time you
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
serve on probation parole however is
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
after you've served a sentence of
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
incarceration you go before the adult
 
03:57:36.630 --> 03:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
parole board and you can then be granted
 
03:57:38.309 --> 03:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
the privilege of parole which is
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
supervision after you've served that
 
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
minimum sentence time served on parole
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
is time serves toward your total
 
03:57:47.870 --> 03:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
sentence so that time is served towards
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
that maximum sentence as well I hope
 
03:57:52.990 --> 03:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
that clarifies pration is generally
 
03:57:55.510 --> 03:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
ordered in an attempt to divert from
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
incarceration give you a chance to
 
03:57:59.070 --> 03:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrate compliance with Community
 
03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
standards if you violate probation you
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
can then be uh rendered a sentence of
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
incarceration from that sentencing judge
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome so what
 
03:58:12.590 --> 03:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
seems weird to me is incarceration is
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
relatively flat but this number is
 
03:58:18.349 --> 03:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
dramatically lower and and so you're
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
saying it's because there's less crime
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
right but saying that's one element but
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
the crime that there is is increasingly
 
03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
violent maybe or something like that is
 
03:58:31.590 --> 03:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
that why that's why both numbers are not
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
going down in a similar way is that it's
 
03:58:36.910 --> 03:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
also sir because the parole violation
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
rate so when you look at that total uh
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
case load of
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
parole if just 10% of that results in a
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
parole violation those are I'll call
 
03:58:49.550 --> 03:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
them incarcerated
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
days and so those incarcerated days are
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
the ones we're trying to shrink because
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
if we can shrink those parole violations
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
through supported Community Action then
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
we can reduce the number of people who
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
are actually incarcerated so the new
 
03:59:07.349 --> 03:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
sentence new incarcerated sentence
 
03:59:08.990 --> 03:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
bookings that happen in New Hampshire
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
those are continue to be relatively
 
03:59:14.110 --> 03:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
static so that crime rate but it is the
 
03:59:16.630 --> 03:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
conduct while on parole and granted
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
again comparison to the the case load
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's a small number of people but that
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
small number of people utilize a high
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
amount of incarcerated stays so we
 
03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
really trying to focus in on that data
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
element we worked a lot and actually in
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
hindsight if I haven't I will make sure
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
we send out to this committee with the
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
council state governments who did a
 
03:59:38.830 --> 03:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
two-prong study of high utilizer of our
 
03:59:40.750 --> 03:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
jail service in the state and then
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
mapped to prison service and looked at
 
03:59:44.630 --> 03:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid service
 
03:59:46.469 --> 03:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
and to try to narrow in and say where
 
03:59:48.910 --> 03:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
are we where are where's the most need
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
or the most intervention to reduce the
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
cost of the state and the justice system
 
03:59:54.990 --> 03:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that will help inform this
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee a lot and it centers on those
 
03:59:58.910 --> 03:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
individuals returning to incarceration
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
from parole violations uh and the top
 
04:00:03.630 --> 04:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
three reasons their parole is violated
 
04:00:06.309 --> 04:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
is for re-engagement in criminal conduct
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
substance use or substance use disorder
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
and lack of compliance with treatment
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
and that that three-pronged combination
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
is where we're really focusing our
 
04:00:19.630 --> 04:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
resources you're welcome EV so then um
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
the reason that it's better to have more
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
parole officers with smaller case loads
 
04:00:29.630 --> 04:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
is that you can support the Parolees
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
better with the hope of having them not
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
be reincarceration would that be
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
correct represent there's actually
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's lots of studies that try to
 
04:00:43.590 --> 04:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
answer that question okay um and I and
 
04:00:46.110 --> 04:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
they they're really inconclusive but the
 
04:00:48.349 --> 04:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
idea of the specialty courts and I I'll
 
04:00:50.429 --> 04:00:50.439 align:start position:0%
narrow in there because that's important
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
is we've already pre-identified people
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
are high risk in those specialty courts
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
and having that really supervision to
 
04:00:59.309 --> 04:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
treatment compliance is the part where
 
04:01:01.990 --> 04:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
we've really demonstrated efficacy that
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
it helps reduce people to continue into
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
the justice system uh that's where we
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
want to get to that 1 to 35 and the 1 to
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
50 is literally to make sure people are
 
04:01:15.149 --> 04:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
compliant with their parole plan and
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's had it's hard to ask a person to
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
manage a hundred people at different
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
risk levels so we also assess their risk
 
04:01:26.910 --> 04:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
and on page uh 11 I try to give you uh
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
the examples of those levels of
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
supervision in the in the bottom right
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
corner because if we have a high-risk
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
person we're going to spend more time
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
checking in on you and we literally have
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
to have enough probation parole officers
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
to meet those
 
04:01:42.630 --> 04:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
obligations and and incarceration is the
 
04:01:46.349 --> 04:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
most expensive of all the absolutely yes
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
y okay and so when the Judiciary tells
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
us that drug court is working well this
 
04:01:53.550 --> 04:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
is sort of where we see the number that
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
proves it right is that the idea all
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:03.950 --> 04:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
see it's it's also sir when I uh come
 
04:02:05.630 --> 04:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
and testify that we need more probation
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
appr officers that more you ad specialty
 
04:02:10.990 --> 04:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
courts yeah thank
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
you uh so then on uh page 14
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh making sure we show you our funding
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
sources uh this committee knows well we
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
are primarily uh General funds we have a
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
small portion of federal funds we
 
04:02:26.429 --> 04:02:26.439 align:start position:0%
utilized arpa funds and then we have
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
these other funds and we try to explain
 
04:02:29.950 --> 04:02:29.960 align:start position:0%
those uh underneath our Correctional
 
04:02:32.510 --> 04:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
Industries some uh grants associated
 
04:02:34.910 --> 04:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
with VCA uh vocational training trust
 
04:02:37.550 --> 04:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
dollars um and miscellaneous items such
 
04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:42.149 align:start position:0%
dollars um and miscellaneous items such
as

04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
that just paused see if you have any
 
04:02:44.479 --> 04:02:47.189 align:start position:0%
that just paused see if you have any
questions

04:02:47.189 --> 04:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
there um so what's the other funds would
 
04:02:53.710 --> 04:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
be from where yeah underneath uh our
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
Correctional Industries program so the
 
04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
sign shop and those uh elements I see
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeah furniture and exactly those things
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
chair I'm I'm new to this committee so
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
there may be stuff going on here that I
 
04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
not not not aware not aware of but the
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
first thing that jumps out of me on this
 
04:03:20.110 --> 04:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
chart p on page 14 is how do you
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
possibly do in fiscal 26 what you did in
 
04:03:25.120 --> 04:03:26.510 align:start position:0%
possibly do in fiscal 26 what you did in
fiscal

04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
25 with so less with so much less
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
money uh part of that major shift is no
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
longer needing those arpa dollars so
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
that's a a major shift there um and then
 
04:03:42.630 --> 04:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
when we navigate to the other Pages I'm
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to explain a little bit of
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
some of the strategy that we're
 
04:03:49.469 --> 04:03:49.479 align:start position:0%
proposing around our overtime funding so
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
very intuitive question
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
sir so as we flip to the next page on
 
04:03:55.279 --> 04:03:59.469 align:start position:0%
sir so as we flip to the next page on
page

04:03:59.469 --> 04:03:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
15 what you can see uh and what we've
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
done on purpose is broken out our
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
general funds and you can see the
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
percent of those uh funds by each fiscal
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
year across the total
 
04:04:13.910 --> 04:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
allocation so when you look at the
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
difference that representative Ms just
 
04:04:18.630 --> 04:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
asked um and as I I have to try to
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
remember where I testified about this
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
the last time so forgive me sir uh and
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee when you look
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
at our overtime line we had historically
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh put monies in that overtime line uh
 
04:04:33.070 --> 04:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at fy2 there are $7.4
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
million there in uh 26 and 27 we've put
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
$2,100 hence why those bar graphs look
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
very different it is not because this
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
department depart doesn't think we're
 
04:04:47.149 --> 04:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
going to need overtime funding but on
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
the following page what we're suggesting
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
is to continue to allow us to use the
 
04:04:53.990 --> 04:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
foot note you've provided in the past
 
04:04:56.429 --> 04:04:56.439 align:start position:0%
where we take funding from our vacant
 
04:04:58.429 --> 04:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
positions and benefits and salaries and
 
04:05:00.710 --> 04:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
move those into overtime and then if
 
04:05:03.670 --> 04:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
those funds do not fill the void then we
 
04:05:05.710 --> 04:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
would come back before fiscal and ask
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
for additional
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um so it's a two-pronged
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
effort to use both the vacant and
 
04:05:14.149 --> 04:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
benefit lines as we've done in the ped
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
and that has been successful to fill for
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
overtime that has resulted from those
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
vacancies but in the absence of existing
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
funds in the fiscal year and that
 
04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
strategy working that we would go before
 
04:05:26.189 --> 04:05:26.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal to ask for additional
 
04:05:30.269 --> 04:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
overtime so all right let me ask first
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
so the permanent line then includes a
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
lot of unfunded positions or not they're
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
all funded I mean un unfilled positions
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
yes so we currently have a for example a
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
42% vacancy rate in our law enforcement
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
ranks which is significantly better uh
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
than it was uh six plus months ago so
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're moving in the right direction but
 
04:06:02.030 --> 04:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
we would then move those lines in in the
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
absence of filled positions into the
 
04:06:07.469 --> 04:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
overtime line so why is this Superior to
 
04:06:09.750 --> 04:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
Simply budgeting more like what you
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
think is going to happen namely that
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
most of those positions are going to
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
stay un unfilled and more overtime will
 
04:06:20.790 --> 04:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
happen well we're hopeful that we move
 
04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
in a better trend line which we have
 
04:06:25.469 --> 04:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
been doing and U cognizant of the
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
state's current uh financial situation
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
so we didn't want to ask for money that
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
we really couldn't necessarily forecast
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
but if as we travel through the
 
04:06:35.309 --> 04:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
budgeting process the house and the
 
04:06:37.389 --> 04:06:37.399 align:start position:0%
Senate want to put line or funding in
 
04:06:39.750 --> 04:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
our overtime line we would not be uh
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think you probably already
 
04:06:48.990 --> 04:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
answered this but if the way I'm reading
 
04:06:53.590 --> 04:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is um the FY 26 efficiency
 
04:06:55.149 --> 04:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
expenditure request what you're saying
 
04:06:57.870 --> 04:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
is that if all of the positions are
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
filled then you'll for permanent for
 
04:07:04.389 --> 04:07:04.399 align:start position:0%
example you'll you'll need 71,1
 
04:07:08.590 --> 04:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
174,000 and virtually no overtime it it
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
but if those if those positions aren't
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
all filled then that $71 Million number
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
is going to come down and it's going to
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you and then so then as
 
04:07:28.990 --> 04:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
we navigate through uh other areas where
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
the department affects the general fund
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's been traditionally in our
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and our medical
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
payments to Providers and we've um taken
 
04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of effort in trying to reduce
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
those costs in prescription drugs as
 
04:07:43.109 --> 04:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
well as medical payments to Providers
 
04:07:44.830 --> 04:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
are especially Community Based uh
 
04:07:47.429 --> 04:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
payments so we're embarking on a new
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
initiative uh utilizing a centers for
 
04:07:52.870 --> 04:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
medicated Medicare Services 1115a
 
04:07:54.990 --> 04:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
re-entry waiver and the state was
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
granted that waiver and it started on
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
January 1st and our first cohort of
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
individuals will be eligible to
 
04:08:02.670 --> 04:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
participate in the middle of this month
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
so what is that waiver it provides 45
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
days for people prior to release
 
04:08:10.750 --> 04:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage and two provider
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
encounters and two peer-to-peer
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
encounters as as well as 30 days of
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
medications upon release and then all of
 
04:08:20.109 --> 04:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
the other managed care benefits of
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
helping a person who's released from
 
04:08:24.630 --> 04:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
incarceration navigate continued Health
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
Care coverage so when I talked about
 
04:08:27.910 --> 04:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
those three pronged efforts of people
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
returning to incarceration this is our
 
04:08:32.070 --> 04:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
goal to continue to stabilize that
 
04:08:34.590 --> 04:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
transition of treatment to community and
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
have some of those costs uh covered
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid especially the discharge
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
medications we also continue on the
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical line to have our 340b
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
partnership with health and human
 
04:08:47.070 --> 04:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
services so we have a lot of discounted
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals around the treatment of
 
04:08:50.670 --> 04:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted infections and
 
04:08:53.469 --> 04:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C we continue to have funding
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
under the state opioid response dollars
 
04:08:57.550 --> 04:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
to help provide uh pharmaceutical
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
payments for treatment of medication for
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder and I apologize that
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
acronym changes so many times so I'm
 
04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
just going to use the one I know
 
04:09:07.950 --> 04:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
today uh and then we also continue to
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
have our pharmaceutical and Therapeutics
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
committee where our chief pharmacist
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
meets with the providers and talks about
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
the trending right now we're getting an
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
incredible uh reduced rate on the
 
04:09:19.790 --> 04:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
treatment of medications for opio use
 
04:09:22.030 --> 04:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
disorder and we just really navigate
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
this on a monthly basis to see what we
 
04:09:26.469 --> 04:09:26.479 align:start position:0%
can do to really maximize the the
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
efficiency of our purchasing and make it
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
cost effective while we also deliver the
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate treatment during
 
04:09:34.429 --> 04:09:34.439 align:start position:0%
incarceration on the Medicaid payments
 
04:09:36.830 --> 04:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
to Providers um I think some of the work
 
04:09:38.590 --> 04:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
that we're doing again with that 1115 a
 
04:09:40.510 --> 04:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
waiver complements what we're trying to
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish um as well as talking about
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
some of what we see uh with regards to
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
inpatient stays and making sure those
 
04:09:50.349 --> 04:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
eligible inpatient stays during Inc
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
incarceration are remitted for Medicaid
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
payment rather than general fund payment
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
I think there's some opportunity for
 
04:09:59.389 --> 04:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
conversation around how those claims are
 
04:10:01.469 --> 04:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
coded um there are things called
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
Observation stays we as Citizens when we
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
go to the hospital there's an
 
04:10:06.630 --> 04:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
observation stay and if that observation
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
stay is coded by a provider that way and
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
it's 7 days it's still an observation
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
stay those are not eligible for payment
 
04:10:14.990 --> 04:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
under impatient paent in Medicaid um so
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
we're really looking at those
 
04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities to Advocate both at the
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
federal level within the state
 
04:10:22.750 --> 04:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities of whatever in law to help
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
us really narrow how that happens
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it affects this line in the
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
general fund and how we can really use
 
04:10:30.109 --> 04:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
different opportunities to pay for
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
health care for people incarcerated in
 
04:10:31.560 --> 04:10:33.149 align:start position:0%
health care for people incarcerated in
New

04:10:33.149 --> 04:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we go out for
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative evil um could you I mean
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
I assume when you're in a Corrections
 
04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
Facility the facility is respond
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for your medical care pretty
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
much like so what happens if there are
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
Cuts in Medicaid or you know from the
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
federal government I mean at the state's
 
04:10:56.830 --> 04:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to pick it up or how do
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
you see that playing out if you had less
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Finance opportunity let's put
 
04:11:04.429 --> 04:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
it that way y so right now represent
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
aable about $2 million is deferred to
 
04:11:08.830 --> 04:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid budget and the rest of the
 
04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
cost is borne by the state through
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
general fund so that $2 million would be
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
affected in some way and the state would
 
04:11:18.710 --> 04:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
would bear that cost so when you look at
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
a total of potentially $13 million that
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't even represent the 2 million
 
04:11:24.670 --> 04:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
that we've deferred so we basically
 
04:11:26.670 --> 04:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
could have a $2 million liability if the
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
federal government doesn't give us that
 
04:11:28.239 --> 04:11:29.229 align:start position:0%
federal government doesn't give us that
Medicaid

04:11:29.229 --> 04:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
coverage I hope that answers your
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
question is the reason that um fiscal
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
year 27 is lower than 26 is because you
 
04:11:41.550 --> 04:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
assume you're going to sort of get
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
better at uh moving things off onto
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid than you are today is that kind
 
04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
of it is representative McGuire and it's
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
also our hope that we continue to reduce
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
the reincarceration rate so really
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
tackling reducing that reincarceration
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
rate decreases the cost to the medical
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
care you're
 
04:12:04.830 --> 04:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
welcome okay so you'll also see that the
 
04:12:06.750 --> 04:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
other items under what we calling
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
operation expenses those stay relatively
 
04:12:10.750 --> 04:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
static some of those we don't have much
 
04:12:12.550 --> 04:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
control over with regard to utilities
 
04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
and heat and things of that nature um
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
obviously replacing the New Hampshire
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
state prison for men in the state's
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
future reduces those costs in general
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a very physically efficient uh
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and then when we go down
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
to our total operational expenses that
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
equal a million or less you can see that
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
those are not climbing drastically in
 
04:12:34.229 --> 04:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
this budget
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
proposal uh you also asked about
 
04:12:39.469 --> 04:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
positions we've stayed relatively static
 
04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
on the total number of positions in this
 
04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
department um you'll see we have one
 
04:12:45.309 --> 04:12:45.319 align:start position:0%
unfunded in order to meet our our
 
04:12:46.910 --> 04:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
proposed budget Target at the time we
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
unfunded a correctional Industries
 
04:12:53.550 --> 04:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
accounting on page
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
16 uh talk about uh the footnote I
 
04:13:01.710 --> 04:13:01.720 align:start position:0%
described on overtime I would continue
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh with the footnote associated with
 
04:13:06.510 --> 04:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
prescription drug expenses and medical
 
04:13:08.309 --> 04:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
payments to providers because we have to
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
provide constitutionally appropriate
 
04:13:12.149 --> 04:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
care and there are definitely some
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
unpredictable medical uh outliers that
 
04:13:16.670 --> 04:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
occur in the fiscal year and I think
 
04:13:18.189 --> 04:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
those are important safety elements for
 
04:13:20.710 --> 04:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
the department and the
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
state on page SE uh 17 uh really candid
 
04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
demonstration of our overtime costs uh
 
04:13:29.349 --> 04:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
but I also want to point out that the
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
overtime hours have gone down it's the
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
cost per hour that has increased and uh
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
some of that is appropriately the result
 
04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
of having a more competitive wage with
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
our other law enforcement U Partners
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
across the state so we are able to
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
recruit it's the negotiated double
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
overtime um and included in this uh
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
could be other costs around Health Care
 
04:13:53.149 --> 04:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
staff who are also working over time uh
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
but mostly this is our law enforcement
 
04:13:56.670 --> 04:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
Rank and
 
04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
file uh there was a also a 10% and a 2%
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
raise so those increases uh really
 
04:14:05.950 --> 04:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
tackle into this 35% increase in the
 
04:14:05.960 --> 04:14:07.469 align:start position:0%
tackle into this 35% increase in the
overtime

04:14:07.469 --> 04:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
rate uh in the bottom leftand corner try
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
to give you a trended history of our
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
sworn or lawn enforcement staff uh some
 
04:14:15.990 --> 04:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
of you have seen this for the new
 
04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
members we certainly were hit hard uh
 
04:14:21.389 --> 04:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
postco with a lot of retirements um the
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
last fiscal years have showed some
 
04:14:24.830 --> 04:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
stabilization significant stabilization
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
in the number of people retiring while
 
04:14:28.710 --> 04:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
also the movement interaction and
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
recruiting new law enforcement Rank and
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
file to our staff and the number 30 just
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
represents where we are in this current
 
04:14:36.030 --> 04:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so we're trending in a great
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
direction that we're already at hiring
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
30 new law enforcement officers to our
 
04:14:41.910 --> 04:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
department while we balance retaining
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
individuals as well
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then our correctional officer
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate coming down to 42% which is
 
04:14:49.750 --> 04:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
still scary number but it's a heck of a
 
04:14:52.189 --> 04:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
lot better than where we were what does
 
04:14:52.199 --> 04:14:53.469 align:start position:0%
lot better than where we were what does
termed

04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
termed
 
04:14:55.590 --> 04:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
mean that's a good question where are
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
you reading that sir um SW that thank
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
you it always throws me up termed means
 
04:15:03.429 --> 04:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
literally they uh separated from us it
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we terminated them it's an
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
HR term I don't like but it comes out of
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
the system that way so it could be self
 
04:15:11.790 --> 04:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
selected departure from the Department
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
or we could have invited somebody to
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
depart but they've essentially separated
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
their employment with us all right so
 
04:15:19.109 --> 04:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
somebody was working for us and decided
 
04:15:21.109 --> 04:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
to go work in Massachusetts or something
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
like that versus choosing to retire I
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
you a month um do you have a
 
04:15:36.229 --> 04:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
um do you are you tracking the age of
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
your employees and do you see a a an
 
04:15:41.389 --> 04:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
upcoming retirement tsunami or is that
 
04:15:44.550 --> 04:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
are you past that we I'm going to get
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
you to some of that on page 21 but I
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it has the age Break um and
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
I can follow up with that so the average
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
tenure of our staff used to be about 10
 
04:15:58.670 --> 04:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
years it's now about um eight and so you
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
actually see a you do see a change in
 
04:16:03.109 --> 04:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
tenure and then the age range are
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
changing so we're um I literally just
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
printed that graph and I I feel a little
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
silly I should have brought it with me
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
we do have a call it a a younger group
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
younger than I group uh but it's still a
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
nice little uh curve it's not too sharp
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'll get that out to the
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee it's it's a normal curve it's
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
a totally normal curve um and they even
 
04:16:24.510 --> 04:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
have just for interest of socially
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
managing groups uh their um generation
 
04:16:30.429 --> 04:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
so YX Baby Boomers and so forth so if
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's an interest to the committee I'll
 
04:16:37.070 --> 04:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.870 --> 04:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
welcome on uh page I think the don't
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
think it has page number but the
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
following page on page 18 just want to
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
take a moment and appreciate this
 
04:16:46.990 --> 04:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee and the other members of the
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
legislature for supporting what I would
 
04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
call it is the um uh salary stability of
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
our law enforcement rank shows where we
 
04:16:56.750 --> 04:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
were in 2022 that we were the lowest
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
paid State uh law enforcement officers
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
and now in the bottom right hand corner
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
you can see our starting pay in
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
comparison to other counterparts across
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
the state and then we continue to
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
monitor our competition in the community
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
whether it be a County facility or other
 
04:17:13.109 --> 04:17:13.119 align:start position:0%
local police departments so we' made
 
04:17:14.750 --> 04:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
great strides and I just wanted to thank
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm not seeing where we are we used
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
to start what page are we talking oh yep
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's the page that followed the overtime
 
04:17:30.870 --> 04:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
sline yeah y okay so when we came uh
 
04:17:33.229 --> 04:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
before this committee we had a starting
 
04:17:35.469 --> 04:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
pay for our Corrections Officers at $20
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
an hour after the legislatively
 
04:17:40.590 --> 04:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
supported reallocation now our starting
 
04:17:43.630 --> 04:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
pay is at 2617 which which makes us more
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
competitive when you look at the other
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement ranks in state agencies
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
but also when you look at what local
 
04:17:51.070 --> 04:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
police departments are paying new law
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers uh and other County
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
Corrections departments we are now
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
competitive rather than being the lowest
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
paid law enforcement in the state of New
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh I see I thought you were
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
comparing us to other states no no but
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
we are still competitive gotcha
 
04:18:09.030 --> 04:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank in fact because we have an income
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
tax we might be more competitive if
 
04:18:14.349 --> 04:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
that's being publicly heard
 
04:18:17.109 --> 04:18:17.119 align:start position:0%
on uh page 19 I just wanted to give you
 
04:18:18.870 --> 04:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
a high level you know because obviously
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
our strategic plan has been to increase
 
04:18:23.550 --> 04:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
our staffing um increase our retention
 
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh targeting technology for efficiency
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
and and dealing with the infrastructure
 
04:18:29.550 --> 04:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
issues and I wanted to give you a
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
calendar year uh just high level road
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
map of the recruitment initiatives and
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
retention initiatives that we've been
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
engaged in uh for several years and I
 
04:18:40.389 --> 04:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
I'll give you time to to read that but I
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
I felt it was important to share with
 
04:18:41.840 --> 04:18:43.790 align:start position:0%
I felt it was important to share with
you

04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
and then the following two pages are
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
more efforts we've done in recruitment
 
04:18:50.429 --> 04:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
retention we update these very regularly
 
04:18:52.229 --> 04:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
we get them out to our staff both to
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
keep them informed of what's going on um
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know how many career fairs we've
 
04:18:59.469 --> 04:18:59.479 align:start position:0%
gone to 108 community events 35
 
04:19:02.189 --> 04:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
classroom talks 36 uh college and high
 
04:19:04.510 --> 04:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
school tours 37 these are important
 
04:19:06.070 --> 04:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
changes in this department because we
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
weren't doing this before and uh people
 
04:19:09.790 --> 04:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know what a career and
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
Corrections was and so we're using not
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
just our law enforcement officers but
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
our mental health clinicians and our
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
nurses and our probation andol officers
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
to really get out there and show our
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
communities and our young people and
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
people who are unsure where they want to
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
take a career uh that there is a career
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
in Corrections and the other uh piece
 
04:19:28.030 --> 04:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're engaged in is the reality that the
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
research shows working in Corrections
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
can be incredibly challenging uh
 
04:19:34.030 --> 04:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
increases your susceptibility to have
 
04:19:36.630 --> 04:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
PTSD and other known uh mental health
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
conditions and we really don't want that
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
for our uh staff in the New Hampshire
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections so we've
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
created per peer support programs using
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
Crisis Intervention training and we have
 
04:19:49.109 --> 04:19:49.119 align:start position:0%
a comfort dog program we've created what
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
are called Wellness areas in our
 
04:19:52.710 --> 04:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities so if you need
 
04:19:55.389 --> 04:19:55.399 align:start position:0%
to after an escalated event go to a
 
04:19:57.550 --> 04:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
space that feels a lot more normative
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
you can do that um these are tried
 
04:20:01.870 --> 04:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
andrue research methods and we continue
 
04:20:04.030 --> 04:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
to try to stay a stride of that
 
04:20:06.910 --> 04:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
work representative cell thank you Mr
 
04:20:08.590 --> 04:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
chair did I hear you say do you have
 
04:20:11.870 --> 04:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
co-op co-op programs there such as with
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
like a universal like
 
04:20:15.790 --> 04:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
Northeastern I don't believe I said that
 
04:20:18.750 --> 04:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
I said Comfort dog programs okay but uh
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
would you ever consider doing co-op
 
04:20:22.990 --> 04:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
programs because they have like that law
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement College down there and that
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
might be a good Avenue to get new
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
recruits I'll check into that yeah we
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
are teaching um at a high school level
 
04:20:33.950 --> 04:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
at the Berlin and Groveton high school
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
and uh as extra uh credit course for
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
young adults soon to be young adults to
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
understand there's a career path there
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and I know that some of members of
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
our team actually teach at the collegial
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
level uh so there's some opportunities
 
04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
we've tapped into in that space as well
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
but that's a great
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you uh we have a
 
04:20:54.429 --> 04:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
family support organization where we've
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
partnered with the uh loved ones of
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
people who work in our facilities and
 
04:20:59.870 --> 04:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
and partnered with them and they do
 
04:21:01.950 --> 04:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
really unique and thought thoughtful
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
things like bring incarnations uh so
 
04:21:05.550 --> 04:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
that our team members can take that
 
04:21:06.910 --> 04:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
Carnation home because they don't have
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
time to go buy those things to thank
 
04:21:10.469 --> 04:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
their loved ones on Valentine's Day
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's also meal sharing and another
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
one things that we're doing uh within
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
the department on the following page is
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail about the process how
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
many people it takes us in the
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
recruitment process to get to New highes
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
um and so we really map through that uh
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
some of the question asked earlier I've
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
got the Generations on this one with
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
regard to gender and the generation in
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
which they're working uh we do have the
 
04:21:36.750 --> 04:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
average age at
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
43 I just have it in a graph back at the
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
office and the average years of service
 
04:21:44.109 --> 04:21:44.119 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I'm right 8
 
04:21:46.590 --> 04:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
.13 uh to the question I believe that
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier about um retirement
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
Cliff we have 116 people eligible to
 
04:21:53.790 --> 04:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
retire today we break them out by our
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
group one eligible our group two law
 
04:21:57.790 --> 04:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement and our group two
 
04:21:59.590 --> 04:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
Correctional line Personnel who are also
 
04:21:59.600 --> 04:22:00.830 align:start position:0%
Correctional line Personnel who are also
law

04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement and then I have both our we
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
refer to them as our civilian staff the
 
04:22:07.710 --> 04:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
trending and the same trending uh
 
04:22:12.910 --> 04:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
all right in addition to the questions
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
you asked you asked about new general
 
04:22:16.080 --> 04:22:17.149 align:start position:0%
you asked you asked about new general
fund

04:22:17.149 --> 04:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations one of those
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
implementations uh was in
 
04:22:25.149 --> 04:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
2223 we uh had asked uh during the uh
 
04:22:26.710 --> 04:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
Finance phase of the budget for
 
04:22:28.630 --> 04:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
additional Appropriations to outfit the
 
04:22:30.269 --> 04:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
whole of the department and body warrant
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
cameras and uh that was so afforded to
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
us so I want to appreciate the
 
04:22:36.109 --> 04:22:36.119 align:start position:0%
legislature for that um that has been a
 
04:22:38.349 --> 04:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
successful program and so to the point
 
04:22:41.189 --> 04:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
of your ask what is funding that will be
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
asking to maintain that there is
 
04:22:43.040 --> 04:22:44.830 align:start position:0%
asking to maintain that there is
approximately

04:22:44.830 --> 04:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
$445,900 per year to maintain that
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
program that program has been highly
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
successful in both uh affirming our
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
staff have not engaged in wrongdoing uh
 
04:22:57.550 --> 04:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
we've had numerous allegations we're be
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to quickly demonstrate that our
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
staff did not engage in excessive use of
 
04:23:04.109 --> 04:23:04.119 align:start position:0%
force or uh inappropriate dialogue and
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
they've been incredibly helpful in
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
addition we did outfit uh 55 of our
 
04:23:10.510 --> 04:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
department Vehicles primarily our
 
04:23:11.790 --> 04:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
probation and appr vehicles and our
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
transport vehicles with in vehicle
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
cameras and those have been uh
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
instrumental tool as
 
04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
well what does these cameras cost per
 
04:23:21.439 --> 04:23:23.189 align:start position:0%
well what does these cameras cost per
camera

04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
camera
 
04:23:25.630 --> 04:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
yes currently have statewide contract
 
04:23:29.790 --> 04:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
where it's $45 per month per camera $45
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
per month per camera
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
okay can you can you
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
rent so we do use the Statewide purchase
 
04:23:44.349 --> 04:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
procurement process part of my
 
04:23:46.910 --> 04:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
hesitation around buying versus renting
 
04:23:48.510 --> 04:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
is my experience with the Department's
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
conducted energy weapons we bought we
 
04:23:53.429 --> 04:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
sat with them they expired there was no
 
04:23:55.109 --> 04:23:55.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing you sat with this expired
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
technology so there is this balance but
 
04:23:58.550 --> 04:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
we will continue to work with the
 
04:24:00.030 --> 04:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
Department administrative services on
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
the right approach to that program for
 
04:24:01.680 --> 04:24:04.389 align:start position:0%
the right approach to that program for
the

04:24:04.389 --> 04:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
state so do you have an idea if you were
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
to buy what they cost or I don't believe
 
04:24:12.950 --> 04:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bid went out that way okay yeah I
 
04:24:14.429 --> 04:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
mean like in a catalog or something
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
anyways all right representative Ms then
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative evil um the the the
 
04:24:21.309 --> 04:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
footage from these cameras where is that
 
04:24:23.630 --> 04:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
stored is that stored in the cloud or it
 
04:24:25.630 --> 04:24:25.640 align:start position:0%
definitely is we use evidence.com and
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's part of the contract as well okay
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
and you have the prop you have the the
 
04:24:31.389 --> 04:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
right people that know how to access it
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
on a timely basis and manage all that
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
stuff we do right we didn't add any
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
other staff which is another test with
 
04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
us adding technology and not adding
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
resources to manage it but we are
 
04:24:43.950 --> 04:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
managing it uh the division of
 
04:24:45.189 --> 04:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
Professional Standards within our
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
department did Advocate uh to me
 
04:24:50.590 --> 04:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
recently for one full-time um redaction
 
04:24:52.109 --> 04:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
so what we're finding and we did not
 
04:24:54.309 --> 04:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
think about was when defense attorneys
 
04:24:57.229 --> 04:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
and other individuals need video uh and
 
04:24:59.229 --> 04:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
or prosecutors need video we didn't
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
allocate resources to that we're just
 
04:25:02.349 --> 04:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
trying to absorb it with what we have
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
and action capability that's when you
 
04:25:06.030 --> 04:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
like fuzz the images in the background
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
especially when we go in uh to a home
 
04:25:09.870 --> 04:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
visit and there's a child or other
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
things we don't uh that's not
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate how do you do that that now
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
we do it through the evidence.com
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
redaction process that's in the software
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
technology oh okay
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
yeah um maybe you sort of explained this
 
04:25:28.750 --> 04:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
but could what is in the um
 
04:25:28.760 --> 04:25:30.750 align:start position:0%
but could what is in the um
$45,881

04:25:30.750 --> 04:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
$45,881
 
04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
is that rental or what it's right I just
 
04:25:35.950 --> 04:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could break down that
 
04:25:40.590 --> 04:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
number for us so it's for 520 um body
 
04:25:43.910 --> 04:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
warn cameras at $45 per month and then
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
we have technically 110 vehicle cameras
 
04:25:47.309 --> 04:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
because there's one in the front one in
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
the back and those are $125 per month I
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
see and and so this is rental costs to
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
keep it going it includes the software
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
that she just talked about too
 
04:26:05.030 --> 04:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:06.790 --> 04:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
you all right yeah on page 23 asked
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
about uh new position positions
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
established and so uh going back to 2020
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
to 2027 we've uh increased from 971 to
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
973 and that increase was the result of
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
adding uh re-entry care coordination and
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
this has been a a piloted project that
 
04:26:32.109 --> 04:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
started back in
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
2018 uh when we received funding through
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
what was at the time State targeted
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
response dollars which is now State
 
04:26:44.109 --> 04:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
opioid response dollars um we asked for
 
04:26:46.469 --> 04:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
funding for a one full-time re-entry
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
care coordinator to work with women 12
 
04:26:51.309 --> 04:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
months post relase that had opioid use
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
disorder in an assertive case management
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
model what we found under that federally
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
Grant funded opportunity is it was
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
successful in reducing returns to
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration in that first year so in
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
2019 we asked for additional
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
Appropriations under those grants for
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
two uh reentry care coordinators for men
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
to follow them 12 months Post Release
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
under the same methodology so with those
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
three FTE through the course of 2018
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
moving forward it did demonstrate
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
success in reducing what is the highest
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
risk period for return which is 12
 
04:27:24.269 --> 04:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
months Post Release as a result of that
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
and through the budget process in
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
2022 uh we added three full-time uh
 
04:27:31.870 --> 04:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
re-entry care coordinators funded
 
04:27:34.189 --> 04:27:34.199 align:start position:0%
through the state and the reason I asked
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
for that funding through the state is we
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
needed the stabilization the one thing
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
we found is if there were any gaps in
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
that federally Grant funded we end up
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
losing people and having times of
 
04:27:46.990 --> 04:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy and these really demonstrated
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
the effectiveness um and I'm trying to
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
show you that in the chart at the bottom
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
of page 23 so this is the revolving case
 
04:27:55.710 --> 04:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
load they're managing each month and
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
that small red bar are the people that
 
04:28:00.109 --> 04:28:00.119 align:start position:0%
are returning to incarceration so
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
they're really keeping people who are at
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
risk out in the community and uh just
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrating why they were established
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
and how they are effective and include
 
04:28:11.830 --> 04:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of their positions on that page
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:28:15.309 --> 04:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
well on the following page it goes into
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
great depth and detail about their roles
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh certainly leave that to you to read
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
um we are also doing harm reduction and
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
that harm reduction uh through the same
 
04:28:27.670 --> 04:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
pilot providing people the voluntary
 
04:28:30.429 --> 04:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to opioid overdose reversal
 
04:28:32.109 --> 04:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
drugs actually showed that we're
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
reducing uh the number of opioid
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths in the supervised
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
population again it's voluntary it's not
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
forced but it is showing a reduction in
 
04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
in addition to new positions established
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh Lessons Learned From the work that we
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh had to uh request during covid and
 
04:28:53.710 --> 04:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
using the National Guard in non-armed
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
control rooms uh worked with uh the
 
04:28:58.429 --> 04:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
division of administrative services and
 
04:29:01.149 --> 04:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
our legal council to create a a
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
non-benefited um a non full-time
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
position that we refer to as pum
 
04:29:09.710 --> 04:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
positions these pum positions have
 
04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
helped us reduce the forced over time
 
04:29:15.070 --> 04:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
put people safely in a trained role to
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
run control rooms while we continue to
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
recruit for full-time law enforcement
 
04:29:21.950 --> 04:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I just wanted to point those out
 
04:29:24.109 --> 04:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
it has been successful the other reason
 
04:29:25.830 --> 04:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's been successful is some of those
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement retirees want to retire
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
but they still want to give service and
 
04:29:31.830 --> 04:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
they don't want to maintain their
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
certification as law enforcement so
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
they've elected actually to take these
 
04:29:37.389 --> 04:29:37.399 align:start position:0%
pum positions and they've already got
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
the landscape of the department so it's
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
really a win-win and then the other
 
04:29:43.229 --> 04:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
value is we've had some college students
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
come on as pum and then end up becoming
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
full-time officers so the the benefit
 
04:29:51.750 --> 04:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.760 --> 04:29:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
department

04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:29:57.630 --> 04:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
okay then number three you asked about
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
General funds and arpa funds so we did
 
04:30:03.870 --> 04:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
apply for the sweep tap as it was called
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
and um were afforded some funding for
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
that that funding was uh Guardian RFID
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
technology that technology we are uh
 
04:30:14.269 --> 04:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
still in the process of deploying it is
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
to get us off paper based systems on
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
basic fundamental elements and
 
04:30:20.109 --> 04:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
Corrections such as conducting rounds
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
and counts um this technology also will
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
help us do tool and inventory controls
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
um and again we're still in the process
 
04:30:29.189 --> 04:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
of getting it completely outfitted at
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
all locations and the ongoing um hit to
 
04:30:38.349 --> 04:30:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
$378,000 uh let's see underneath uh the
 
04:30:45.109 --> 04:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
other f in is for fusus technology and
 
04:30:48.149 --> 04:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
the the ongoing maintenance uh from that
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
arpa funed project would have uh happen
 
04:30:53.670 --> 04:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
in 2027 uh for the amount of
 
04:30:56.510 --> 04:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
$170,000 it is a software subscription
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
on the following page 27 give a high Lev
 
04:31:02.910 --> 04:31:02.920 align:start position:0%
overview of that product it also um
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
really allows us to consolidate all of
 
04:31:08.870 --> 04:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
our digital information um make it easy
 
04:31:11.469 --> 04:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
to navigate and get to bring up video
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
cameras for surveillance in effective
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
ways uh really increase that efficiency
 
04:31:17.070 --> 04:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
and transparency throughout the
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
department so that we can use technology
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
for efficiency while we continue to sh
 
04:31:24.309 --> 04:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
up our Staffing
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
Resources and then I do have one more
 
04:31:28.990 --> 04:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
page on page
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
28 uh just pointing out that arpa at one
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
point was funding a salary enhancement
 
04:31:37.269 --> 04:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
for our nursing staff that was bargained
 
04:31:39.109 --> 04:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
into the bargaining agreement and so
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
those enhancements will continue in 26
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
27 and so to the this the intent of your
 
04:31:46.710 --> 04:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
question just wanted to make sure we
 
04:31:48.389 --> 04:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
included that as
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
well so that's what I've provided for
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
you today happy to answer uh questions
 
04:31:55.269 --> 04:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
or again take those questions and bring
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
information back let me ask this on page
 
04:32:03.109 --> 04:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
27 it says here nhdoc faces frequent L
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
litigation yes so how much are we
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
talking about here do and I is that all
 
04:32:11.070 --> 04:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
in the Attorney General's budget or is
 
04:32:12.870 --> 04:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
it in your
 
04:32:15.070 --> 04:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question I I think I
 
04:32:17.830 --> 04:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
have just uh become desensitized to the
 
04:32:19.870 --> 04:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
amount of litigation I experienced as a
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
ah head of a correctional organization
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
that is normative across the country and
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
yes the Attorney General's office has
 
04:32:28.590 --> 04:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated legal counsel for us uh
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
recently been able to take a classified
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
position and make it a attorney so we've
 
04:32:36.030 --> 04:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
only just started to have an attorney
 
04:32:38.070 --> 04:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
liaison within our department between
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
the attorney generals and
 
04:32:42.670 --> 04:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves do you have a sense sense of
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General has five people
 
04:32:47.469 --> 04:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this kind of legisl
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
litigation or something like that or you
 
04:32:51.469 --> 04:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
know I will definitely let you know that
 
04:32:54.349 --> 04:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
I have one civil attorney who is our
 
04:32:56.510 --> 04:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
primary leison who has multiple other
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
state agencies and then there are
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
approximately five uh other attorneys
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
that help manage the criminal matters
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding but I would
 
04:33:06.189 --> 04:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
defer to the attorney general they also
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
handle other states criminal matters at
 
04:33:11.429 --> 04:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
the same time we we take a lot of we
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
take a a lot of time from the Attorney
 
04:33:15.230 --> 04:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
General's office the the reason I'm
 
04:33:17.551 --> 04:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
asking these questions is last time we
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
talked to the attorney general about the
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
YDC case they said it's up to us to
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
specify how much we can be sued right so
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
it's there there's a concept called
 
04:33:32.189 --> 04:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity which allows the
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
state to say well you can only sue me
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
for this much or this kind of thing or
 
04:33:38.830 --> 04:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
whatever and so I'm wondering if if
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
there might be somehow legislative
 
04:33:41.359 --> 04:33:42.349 align:start position:0%
there might be somehow legislative
releas

04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
releas
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
for some of these costs right so I think
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative I think that's a great
 
04:33:48.510 --> 04:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
question I am prideful that the
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
department actually doesn't pay out a
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
lot of claims so most of the time it's
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
defending a claim and getting it
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
dismissed so it's not a a payment except
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
for the time paid to that attorney's
 
04:34:01.709 --> 04:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
time but that's still a great
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
you um so were you requested to cut your
 
04:34:15.390 --> 04:34:15.400 align:start position:0%
budget by 4% or some percentage and if
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
so could you I think you've said certain
 
04:34:21.070 --> 04:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
things but could you be specific in
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
outlining how you're accomplishing
 
04:34:24.359 --> 04:34:26.510 align:start position:0%
outlining how you're accomplishing
those

04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
cuts thank you yes on page
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
15 so this was our first
 
04:34:37.709 --> 04:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
Target under Governor sununu have I lost
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
track at this point uh and transitioning
 
04:34:43.750 --> 04:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
over to Governor aot's office so this is
 
04:34:46.349 --> 04:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
our this is our first proposal and what
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
we tried to do is again look at that
 
04:34:51.150 --> 04:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
overtime line and then our prescription
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
drug line and medical payments to
 
04:34:54.990 --> 04:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
Providers line so those are the three
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
yes that you we did do some other things
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
but not to the extent of those three
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
primary Lin B so what would be the
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
aggregate amount of the cut was that
 
04:35:09.551 --> 04:35:09.561 align:start position:0%
like 10 14
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
million between 10 and 14 million
 
04:35:17.390 --> 04:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then um just as a general
 
04:35:19.750 --> 04:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
matter I know you've told us this before
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
but what what is the cost of
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration that may be a hard
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
question no it's not the per the per day
 
04:35:31.949 --> 04:35:31.959 align:start position:0%
cost was it 452 I think it's gone up rep
 
04:35:34.510 --> 04:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
aable it was around 452 but I think we
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
need to update our calculation and so to
 
04:35:39.310 --> 04:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
earlier conversation the average cost
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
per day for parole and supervision is
 
04:35:43.750 --> 04:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
wow so what I'll I'll do after this
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
meeting just to sh up those statements
 
04:35:51.150 --> 04:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
is get you the actual um per day costs
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
depending where somebody is in our
 
04:35:55.869 --> 04:35:55.879 align:start position:0%
system and that's the same whether it's
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
the regardless of the gender yes y
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
yeah did I hear you say $ five or
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
something $2 for probation and parole
 
04:36:12.150 --> 04:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
per day and around $452 but I'm I may be
 
04:36:14.590 --> 04:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
understating that based on
 
04:36:17.789 --> 04:36:17.799 align:start position:0%
today's uh fiscal
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
year I normally publish it in every
 
04:36:22.869 --> 04:36:22.879 align:start position:0%
annual report and I'm behind say that
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
again incarceration $452 a day a prison
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
day per day the last we did the analysis
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
was around
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
$452 we need to update that analysis and
 
04:36:38.230 --> 04:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
the same analysis being on probation and
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
parole per day was $2 so what I had in
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
the back of my mind was more like
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
$50,000 a day for but you're saying it's
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
yeah for year for year for 50 you know
 
04:37:00.590 --> 04:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
this is the yearly cost go ahead
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
8,542 24 for cost of incarceration for
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.080 --> 04:37:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
$858

04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
$858
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
div I see yeah
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah right yeah it's ridiculous
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
okay represent thank you Mr chair
 
04:37:29.629 --> 04:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
um that that's okay I answered most
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
anything chairman Mr chair um we had I'm
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
trying to get my hand around um a bill
 
04:37:38.910 --> 04:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
that was presented us to provide some
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
funding for Waypoint oh um and because
 
04:37:45.629 --> 04:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
one of the things that when they came to
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
the finance committee was that this
 
04:37:50.910 --> 04:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
money would also help this youth it
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
would help them with their youth
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter and find some
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
incarceration diversion programs and um
 
04:38:02.429 --> 04:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
also when the judicial branch came last
 
04:38:04.590 --> 04:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
week to us they're piloting a young
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
adult Court Pilot so what I want to get
 
04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
my handle around is of the when you look
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
at the population by age and you've got
 
04:38:15.310 --> 04:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
17 to
 
04:38:18.470 --> 04:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
30 um there I think the ages they're
 
04:38:22.510 --> 04:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
looking at were um like 18 to 24 17 to
 
04:38:25.789 --> 04:38:25.799 align:start position:0%
24 something like that um so a few
 
04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
questions one how many of that
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
population 17 to 24 um return to
 
04:38:36.429 --> 04:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
incarceration at some point so like for
 
04:38:37.830 --> 04:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
instance if we can prevent them from
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
going in at that age um I'd like to know
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
the savings we'd have of them having to
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
be repeat
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
offenders because it I want to get a
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
handle that if the if this young adult
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
court and Waypoint can work together to
 
04:38:56.349 --> 04:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
reduce incarceration that that savings
 
04:38:58.670 --> 04:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
may be very coste effective to
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
supporting their request for
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
500,000 so that was my my one question
 
04:39:07.310 --> 04:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
and also how many of those 17 to 30 year
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
olds come into incarceration from a
 
04:39:12.269 --> 04:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
homelessness position
 
04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
and in mental health and and and
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
substance abuse too just so when we look
 
04:39:19.910 --> 04:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
at Investments spending we're making in
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
those areas can we justify them based on
 
04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're saving us that
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
$452 per day uh thank you for that I I
 
04:39:31.551 --> 04:39:31.561 align:start position:0%
really appreciate you bringing that up
 
04:39:33.789 --> 04:39:33.799 align:start position:0%
I've been working with judge Delker and
 
04:39:36.189 --> 04:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
we've U made a commitment that we could
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
manage five individuals in their pilot
 
04:39:40.350 --> 04:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
for young adult court because we don't
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
have any extra probation and parle
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
officers I've not been able to expand
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
that effort and so even my budget does
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
not ask for another probation and parole
 
04:39:51.110 --> 04:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
officer so if the legislature is going
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
to provide assistance to the young adult
 
04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
Court we would need at least one
 
04:39:56.190 --> 04:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
probation and parole officer allocated
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
to this department to support that
 
04:39:59.868 --> 04:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
program and it's not just the officer
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's all of the utility we provide them
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh to do their resources Firearms body
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
warn cameras and things in that nature
 
04:40:08.830 --> 04:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
to your question I'm not able to let you
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
know if they were in the status of being
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
housed prior to incarceration I don't
 
04:40:16.270 --> 04:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
have any connectivity to that data but I
 
04:40:18.510 --> 04:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
will share with you that uh from a
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
prevalence rate uh approximately 45% of
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
people incarcerated have a substance use
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
disorder as a primary diagnose and uh
 
04:40:29.470 --> 04:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
that number does not shift uh when it
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
comes to other mental health conditions
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
so I think you can safely assume
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
whatever this number is of 17 to 30 that
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
that statistic add that uh percentage
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
application and they're in that that
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
group um with regards to um returns um
 
04:40:47.948 --> 04:40:47.958 align:start position:0%
savings it's really that per day
 
04:40:50.150 --> 04:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
incarceration rate so any day we can
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
avoid someone's incarceration or
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
reincarceration the savings are going to
 
04:40:57.230 --> 04:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
be based on what we just discussed thank
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
you very much you're very
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
welome all right
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
um other questions from the committee
 
04:41:08.550 --> 04:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative Evil all
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
kinds this is our just for the this is
 
04:41:16.110 --> 04:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
our largest uh Department right so
 
04:41:17.910 --> 04:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's why we're judge me the question
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
no we're not we have 50 minutes more so
 
04:41:24.270 --> 04:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with I'm here for you
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay so I have so my first question is
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
um on a percentage basis how many people
 
04:41:36.270 --> 04:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
are in your jail awaiting trial for
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
extended periods of time or do they go
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
other places uh representative aable
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
we're not a Detention Facility so anyone
 
04:41:45.788 --> 04:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
waiting would be at our County Jail okay
 
04:41:48.430 --> 04:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I get confused a little bit
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm going to give you a caveat
 
04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we uh do an administrative
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
transfer between the county jails so we
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
might have one or two persons but it's
 
04:42:01.628 --> 04:42:01.638 align:start position:0%
very rare okay all right so when they're
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
detained awaiting trial they're in
 
04:42:07.550 --> 04:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
County facilities and then once they're
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
sentenced they come to the state
 
04:42:13.070 --> 04:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
facility as long as it's a sentence of
 
04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
one year or more gotcha so uh to add to
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
your line of questioning there is a
 
04:42:22.270 --> 04:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
place in law that if a person is serving
 
04:42:24.430 --> 04:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
for example two misdemeanor sentences
 
04:42:26.590 --> 04:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
that are concurrent to each other when
 
04:42:30.510 --> 04:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
they get to day 366 to start that second
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
one-year sentence at the county level
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
the County under RSA 31 something calls
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
us and says do you want to take them or
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
do you want to pay us a perdm rate for
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
them to stay
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
here okay and then um I know again I may
 
04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
be confusing jurisdictions okay at the
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
county level I know we've talked a lot
 
04:42:56.750 --> 04:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
about um having federal prisoners but
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
that may be a detention situation I mean
 
04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
do you have anyone that you have for the
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
federal government or we're maybe a
 
04:43:06.670 --> 04:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
transfer situation or something I don't
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
know sorry no that's fair um there's a
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
lot of overlap it's very very fair and
 
04:43:13.390 --> 04:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity to answer a question
 
04:43:16.350 --> 04:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
to help uh people know we we do not hold
 
04:43:19.150 --> 04:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
people for federal sentences but to the
 
04:43:20.590 --> 04:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
point of your last comment we would
 
04:43:22.830 --> 04:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
transfer someone from the state who then
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
owes uh the fed's sentence we would
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
transfer them to the federal government
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
but we don't have an agreement to hold
 
04:43:31.788 --> 04:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
people at our facility for the federal
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
uh Bureau prisons okay all right so I
 
04:43:38.430 --> 04:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
did a little math and divided good uh
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
$78,000 a year it's 200 $4 a day okay so
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
I was no wonder that's getting confused
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
so it's still a huge number but it's
 
04:43:52.590 --> 04:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's not $400 anyways representative
 
04:43:54.788 --> 04:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
months thank you Mr chair since you've
 
04:43:56.948 --> 04:43:56.958 align:start position:0%
um encouraged us to ask more questions
 
04:44:01.470 --> 04:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna Dive Right In um on page um
 
04:44:01.480 --> 04:44:02.470 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna Dive Right In um on page um
page

04:44:02.470 --> 04:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
seven um it looks like there's
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
166 individuals that are um held in you
 
04:44:14.948 --> 04:44:14.958 align:start position:0%
know not in a new in in New Hampshire um
 
04:44:17.550 --> 04:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
can you kind of give us just a kind of a
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
sense of who those folks are and um
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
where they are and why they're there and
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
that and you know what's the relative
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
cost yep so the there is a Interstate
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's an interstate agreement process
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
we have memorandums of understanding
 
04:44:36.190 --> 04:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
with almost every state in the nation um
 
04:44:38.910 --> 04:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
and they uh with us and what happens is
 
04:44:41.390 --> 04:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
if an individual for a multi ude of
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
reasons whether it's uh security threat
 
04:44:46.470 --> 04:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
groups commonly know to as gangs or
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
protective custody issues or their crime
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
in that state is so high-profile we
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
essentially exchange those individuals
 
04:44:57.070 --> 04:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
under an agreement process and vetting
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
process um we've had individuals who
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
they've asked us to take who were unduly
 
04:45:04.270 --> 04:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with staff removing them from
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
that Correctional environment to ours um
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
and again it goes through this mutually
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
rigorous process of Exchange um the cost
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
is neutralized each state agrees that
 
04:45:17.788 --> 04:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
the housing cost is absorbed just like
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
they were in that state and the only
 
04:45:21.628 --> 04:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
time we might seek costs from one
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
another is if their health care exceeds
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
the On-Site Health Care and we do that
 
04:45:29.190 --> 04:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
through mutual agreement and if in those
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
instances the off-site health care
 
04:45:33.150 --> 04:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
starts to exceed what our normative
 
04:45:35.708 --> 04:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
costs are we actually uh usually seek to
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
retrieve that person back if we can
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
resolve the reason we sent them out in
 
04:45:41.350 --> 04:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning so apparently I've been
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
asking all of the same questions that
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
representative run wants to ask so I'm
 
04:45:46.310 --> 04:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
going to see if I'm following up with
 
04:45:49.470 --> 04:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
the right question um so how many outof
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
state um P prisoners do we have I mean
 
04:45:55.550 --> 04:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
how many from from other states are in
 
04:45:58.910 --> 04:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we try to do a one for one
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay so if we have 166 out we generally
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
have 166 in we try it's usually that's
 
04:46:06.510 --> 04:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
the case all right thanks you're welcome
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
so the I mean the general idea is if
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
people commit crimes together they don't
 
04:46:13.110 --> 04:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
want them in the same prison together
 
04:46:15.510 --> 04:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
they want maybe one in Berlin one in
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
conquer and one in Massachusetts or
 
04:46:19.708 --> 04:46:19.718 align:start position:0%
something like that right so that's a
 
04:46:21.670 --> 04:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
great example um and we just don't have
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
the same diverse physical capacity as
 
04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions have yeah so um let
 
04:46:30.430 --> 04:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
me ask this about the the population do
 
04:46:33.310 --> 04:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
you have sense of how many what fraction
 
04:46:36.430 --> 04:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
of them grew up in New Hampshire versus
 
04:46:39.390 --> 04:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
grew up elsewhere and committed crimes
 
04:46:42.390 --> 04:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I I love that question
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the answer to it
 
04:46:47.230 --> 04:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
and I want to know um all I can share
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
with you is individuals when they get to
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
the time of parole there's another
 
04:46:52.868 --> 04:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
agreement uh both embedded in our state
 
04:46:54.230 --> 04:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
law where we participate in an
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
interstate compact supervision process
 
04:46:59.708 --> 04:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to lean into that because I
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
do have cases where it looks like they
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
came here to visit committed a crime
 
04:47:05.310 --> 04:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
here and now they're staying here and we
 
04:47:07.868 --> 04:47:07.878 align:start position:0%
go through that at the time of parole
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
release they try to parole back to their
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
I call it original state Dan yes
 
04:47:14.160 --> 04:47:15.350 align:start position:0%
I call it original state Dan yes
representative

04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you um can you talk to us
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
facilities and the condition of them and
 
04:47:27.190 --> 04:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of them and yeah give us an
 
04:47:29.708 --> 04:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
update on the overall facilities we know
 
04:47:29.718 --> 04:47:31.030 align:start position:0%
update on the overall facilities we know
there's

04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:47:34.470 --> 04:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
longterm plans for a new a new Men's
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
prison the woman's prison is only a few
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
years old so that could be in pretty
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
good shape I I think it'd be helpful if
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
you could give us an update on them I'd
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
be happy to do that thank you for that
 
04:47:48.670 --> 04:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
question the uh 10 original $10 million
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
allocated as well on its way and there's
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of work going on on geological
 
04:47:54.548 --> 04:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
analysis of the property behind the New
 
04:47:55.868 --> 04:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correctional facility for
 
04:47:58.510 --> 04:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
women uh to make sure we could build a
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
replacement facility there and that's
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
looking very good at this point the
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
additional uh 40 million doll allocation
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
is going out for what's called RFI it's
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
a new term I learned from my partners
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
over at Department of Public Works uh to
 
04:48:15.548 --> 04:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
solicit interest in the state to then
 
04:48:17.830 --> 04:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
have those individuals who respond to
 
04:48:20.190 --> 04:48:20.200 align:start position:0%
that RFI be interested in the request
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
for proposal that will go out in March
 
04:48:24.270 --> 04:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
for the additional $40 million and that
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
$40 million will result in um actual
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
construction documents that can then be
 
04:48:32.110 --> 04:48:32.120 align:start position:0%
put out to bid to get to a firm cost on
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
building a replacement of the New
 
04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men um you
 
04:48:36.670 --> 04:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
are right the the Hampshire correctional
 
04:48:38.390 --> 04:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
facility for women is in generally good
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
shape we had some uh warranty issues
 
04:48:42.628 --> 04:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
with the boilers uh but that's been
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
resolved and headed in the right
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
direction the New Hampshire correctional
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
facility for um northern New Hampshire
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facility needs general
 
04:48:52.430 --> 04:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance um and I believe with the
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
capital budget Appropriations the last
 
04:48:55.390 --> 04:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
go around we're headed in the right
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
directions on roof and perimeter
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
security and things of that nature to
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
resolve them and electrical controls so
 
04:49:03.150 --> 04:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
that's good and and we'll put forward
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
anything we need to move forward when it
 
04:49:06.750 --> 04:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
comes to the New Hampshire state prison
 
04:49:09.150 --> 04:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
for men that has really become a very
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
unpredictable state uh lost a boiler and
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
through our partnership and we have
 
04:49:15.430 --> 04:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
three through our partnership at admin
 
04:49:17.948 --> 04:49:17.958 align:start position:0%
Services they helped us get uh one that
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
we basically are parking outside while
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
another boiler went down um it's
 
04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
becoming very unpredictable at this
 
04:49:26.350 --> 04:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
point and we're just doing our best to
 
04:49:29.310 --> 04:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
work both across other state agencies to
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
hold that infrastructure together while
 
04:49:33.868 --> 04:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
we get to the conclusion of U this major
 
04:49:36.190 --> 04:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
project to replace it we have been
 
04:49:39.230 --> 04:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
actively working to get the HVAC project
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
that was funded through arpa to the
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
Finish Line I uh will tell you I went
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
through the whole medium custody South
 
04:49:47.030 --> 04:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
with my lieutenant because on the
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
coldest day this year it wasn't working
 
04:49:51.470 --> 04:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't figure it out but the
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
vendor did come in and help us get to
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
resolve um it's sometimes interesting
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
trying to improve the infrastructure on
 
04:50:01.788 --> 04:50:01.798 align:start position:0%
the old infrastructure and making it
 
04:50:04.470 --> 04:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
work uh one of the areas I think that
 
04:50:06.430 --> 04:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
will have a concern with as the years
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
continue before we replace it is the
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
refrigerant which is no longer FDA
 
04:50:13.150 --> 04:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
approved and we have to buy used
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
refrigerant in some of the areas of the
 
04:50:17.548 --> 04:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure specifically reception
 
04:50:20.350 --> 04:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
and diagnostic um so I will continue to
 
04:50:22.390 --> 04:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
keep you apprised of that infrastructure
 
04:50:25.708 --> 04:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
and I really value you asking that
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
question would it be possible to expand
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
the Berlin Facility by adding another
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
Wing or two is there land is there you
 
04:50:37.110 --> 04:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
know because it you already sort of have
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
a basic design so so represent McGuire
 
04:50:43.708 --> 04:50:43.718 align:start position:0%
that uh facility was designed in 2000 to
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
essentially drop a wing on it as they
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
said you could do some expansion my
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
hesitation is Could you actually recruit
 
04:50:51.628 --> 04:50:51.638 align:start position:0%
the staff to move there and to work
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
there and to provide uh the resources
 
04:50:55.548 --> 04:50:55.558 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure that we would be
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
successful given that we have this
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
Central Mass of Staff now here in
 
04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
conquered whether they would move to
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.910 --> 04:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
work that would be considered cheaper
 
04:51:13.390 --> 04:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
than a brand new one in conquer right
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not I'm not sure we could add
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
1,400 people up there yeah I don't not
 
04:51:22.030 --> 04:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily everybody but you know some
 
04:51:25.030 --> 04:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative rung thank you Mr
 
04:51:28.030 --> 04:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
chair um going back to your population
 
04:51:30.430 --> 04:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
um I was on a school board for many
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
years and we used to put a full court
 
04:51:35.548 --> 04:51:35.558 align:start position:0%
press out if there was any student that
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
was considering dropping out and you
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
know we knew that you know you drop out
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
you're a higher risk of incarceration so
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
when we look at that population
 
04:51:48.910 --> 04:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
particularly the 17 to 30 17 to 30
 
04:51:51.150 --> 04:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
population how many of those are high
 
04:51:51.160 --> 04:51:52.310 align:start position:0%
population how many of those are high
school

04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
graduates uh I will see if we have that
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
information I think we do okay um but I
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't have it right off hand okay thank
 
04:52:01.628 --> 04:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.548 --> 04:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
welcome more
 
04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
questions all right representative
 
04:52:05.320 --> 04:52:07.030 align:start position:0%
questions all right representative
people

04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:52:10.990 --> 04:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
okay I was just curious roughly what the
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
capital budget is for improvements this
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
time around uh for the correctional
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
facility here in conquer repres how much
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
money are we shoveling in see if my
 
04:52:26.190 --> 04:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.510 --> 04:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
estimate I remember talking about all
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
these things I know I don't think my
 
04:52:32.948 --> 04:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
brain was ready for that question you
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
got me today yeah well it isn't the it
 
04:52:37.910 --> 04:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
isn't public works but it's just an
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
interesting contrast when you're talking
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
about the cost of building a new prison
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
so we had a total of 15 projects on the
 
04:52:49.548 --> 04:52:49.558 align:start position:0%
slide that we discussed and that total
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
was $693
 
04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
Million our top three
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
projects when I well let me subtract off
 
04:52:59.070 --> 04:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
a new facility because that's where that
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
number is coming from our top three
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
projects are our New Hampshire state
 
04:53:06.110 --> 04:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
prison for men the steam lines and traps
 
04:53:06.120 --> 04:53:07.470 align:start position:0%
prison for men the steam lines and traps
around

04:53:07.470 --> 04:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:53:10.948 --> 04:53:10.958 align:start position:0%
3.5 uh the replacement of the body alarm
 
04:53:12.670 --> 04:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
manown system at our Northern New
 
04:53:14.788 --> 04:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Correctional Facility is
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
1.8 and then um replacing the boilers
 
04:53:20.548 --> 04:53:20.558 align:start position:0%
has moved up in our priority because of
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
what I just described earlier and that's
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
around $2.1 million at New Hampshire
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
state pris for men so about five and a
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
half six million just in the top
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.120 --> 04:53:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
possibility

04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
add offic
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
have interested
 
04:54:14.230 --> 04:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.910 --> 04:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it is an interesting question we
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
have enough vacancies that if people
 
04:54:20.150 --> 04:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to move they could transfer now
 
04:54:22.868 --> 04:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
but yeah I mean I think that's the other
 
04:54:25.230 --> 04:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
important reality and it's usually a
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
whole family you're relocating the whole
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
family and then your spouse's employment
 
04:54:32.430 --> 04:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
and all of those efforts but uh I
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
believe that right now we have enough
 
04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
people that could move if they wanted to
 
04:54:39.910 --> 04:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
today but it's a fair question yeah and
 
04:54:42.350 --> 04:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
I think um Berlin has done a reasonable
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
job of making their Community more
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
attractive right I mean they're
 
04:54:50.150 --> 04:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
improving it and so more tourism and all
 
04:54:52.670 --> 04:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of I think the Berlin and gorm
 
04:54:55.948 --> 04:54:55.958 align:start position:0%
Community is gorgeous uh it's it's the
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
diversity of professionals to run the
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction so licensed
 
04:55:02.470 --> 04:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
clinicians having enough of them um
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing staff the list of those
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
Diversified professionals is
 
04:55:11.270 --> 04:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
significant yeah
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
shall we uh call it a day for this and
 
04:55:19.350 --> 04:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
come back at 3 o' yeah I I got
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate everyone's questions and if
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
there's anything you think of after let
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%

yeah update that number on the per day
 
04:55:37.230 --> 04:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
charge for incarceration first thing I'm
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
going to do when I go back why why is it
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
stuck in my head at 4 52 because I hate
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be wrong yeah well yeah but it had to
 
04:55:45.830 --> 04:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
have been somewhere and I want to make
 
04:55:47.190 --> 04:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
sure we have it right okay did you
 
04:55:49.390 --> 04:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
update the website with the counts and
 
04:55:51.190 --> 04:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
some of those things we're working on
 
04:55:53.070 --> 04:55:53.080 align:start position:0%
updating some information I can get up
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
right away and I'm working in parallel
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
to get our FY 23 and fy2 24 report uh

05:33:54.270 --> 05:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
so it is 3:00 and we will welcome the
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
Attorney General um to talk about the
 
05:34:20.548 --> 05:34:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.510 --> 05:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh members of the
 
05:34:24.830 --> 05:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
committee just for the record my name is
 
05:34:28.030 --> 05:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
John formela serving as attorney general
 
05:34:29.788 --> 05:34:29.798 align:start position:0%
with me is Kathy Carr who is our
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
director of administration so she helps
 
05:34:35.350 --> 05:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
put together our budget and when I say
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
helps I'm not giving her enough credit
 
05:34:39.948 --> 05:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
she basically put together our
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
budget uh so thank you for having us
 
05:34:45.310 --> 05:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
here today
 
05:34:47.788 --> 05:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
um I I thought it might make sense I
 
05:34:50.310 --> 05:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
know this is the agency overview
 
05:34:51.910 --> 05:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
presentation and and we got some
 
05:34:53.390 --> 05:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
specific questions I figured it would
 
05:34:55.390 --> 05:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
make sense for us to do the overview and
 
05:34:56.788 --> 05:34:56.798 align:start position:0%
then we can address the specific
 
05:34:58.510 --> 05:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions that were received ises that
 
05:35:01.230 --> 05:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
work yeah yeah I think we have like an
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
hour and a half available I don't know
 
05:35:04.708 --> 05:35:04.718 align:start position:0%
if it'll take that long but okay go for
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
it great well we'll stay as long as you
 
05:35:08.470 --> 05:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
need us to
 
05:35:10.430 --> 05:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so we we brought a PowerPoint
 
05:35:12.190 --> 05:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
presentation uh for those of you who
 
05:35:14.110 --> 05:35:14.120 align:start position:0%
were on this division two years ago it's
 
05:35:16.110 --> 05:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to look pretty similar to what you
 
05:35:18.830 --> 05:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
saw before there a couple new things um
 
05:35:20.510 --> 05:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
for anyone who's new be seeing it for
 
05:35:24.750 --> 05:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
the first time um but uh this is just
 
05:35:27.070 --> 05:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
meant to to give an overview and because
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
we're lawyers we put our little disclaim
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
disclaimer on the front that it's meant
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
to hit all of the major functions we do
 
05:35:35.070 --> 05:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
if I forget a small function or two I I
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
apologize we may have missed one or two
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
small functions um on the second page of
 
05:35:43.548 --> 05:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
the presentation you will see an or
 
05:35:47.390 --> 05:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
chart and I'm going to walk through all
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
of these functions but this gives you a
 
05:35:52.150 --> 05:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
good snapshot of of how the how the
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
office looks so at the top there you see
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
the the senior staff a lot of that is
 
05:35:59.190 --> 05:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
what we kind of consider the front
 
05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
office staff and and you can work down
 
05:36:03.948 --> 05:36:03.958 align:start position:0%
the or chart but I think it will be more
 
05:36:06.190 --> 05:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
productive if I just talk about these in
 
05:36:07.830 --> 05:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
more detail as I walk through the
 
05:36:10.150 --> 05:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
presentation but you can refer back to
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
this to get a sense of where everything
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
fits in the in the overall
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
structure on the next page of the
 
05:36:19.230 --> 05:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
presentation we just give you our
 
05:36:21.548 --> 05:36:21.558 align:start position:0%
estimated funding breakdown I say
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
estimated funding breakdown because
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers come from the fiscal year
 
05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
2026 numbers in our agency budget
 
05:36:34.708 --> 05:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
submission so of course that's just the
 
05:36:36.510 --> 05:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
agency budget submission I don't want to
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
get out in front of the governor she'll
 
05:36:42.190 --> 05:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
be presenting her budget next week I
 
05:36:45.150 --> 05:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
expect it'll look roughly the same but
 
05:36:46.990 --> 05:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
these numbers could change a little bit
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
depending on what changes she makes to
 
05:36:51.750 --> 05:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
our budget but that gives you a sense of
 
05:36:54.310 --> 05:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
the funding of the Department of Justice
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
we are well under
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
50% um General funds although creeping a
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
little closer to 50% than we have been
 
05:37:04.190 --> 05:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the past and we're also funded by
 
05:37:06.430 --> 05:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds Highway funds uh inter
 
05:37:08.350 --> 05:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
agency funds and then some other other
 
05:37:08.360 --> 05:37:10.750 align:start position:0%
agency funds and then some other other
funding

05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
sources the next page of the
 
05:37:15.310 --> 05:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
presentation just give some bullets on
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
the various roles of of the Attorney
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
General and and through the Attorney
 
05:37:21.788 --> 05:37:21.798 align:start position:0%
General the Department of Justice the
 
05:37:23.788 --> 05:37:23.798 align:start position:0%
first role of the attorney general which
 
05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
is the role that I think most people
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
think about first when they when they
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
think of us as chief law enforcement
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
officer so the Attorney General is the
 
05:37:33.190 --> 05:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
chief law enforcement officer of the
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
state according to our statutes and
 
05:37:37.590 --> 05:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
provides leadership and supervision to
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement Community the
 
05:37:41.548 --> 05:37:41.558 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is also the chief
 
05:37:44.470 --> 05:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so we both prosecute major
 
05:37:46.230 --> 05:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
criminal cases directly in the
 
05:37:48.708 --> 05:37:48.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice we also exercise a
 
05:37:50.830 --> 05:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
supervisory role over all local
 
05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in the State uh we we work
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
pretty closely with the County attorneys
 
05:37:58.670 --> 05:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
we don't we try not to micromanage what
 
05:37:59.990 --> 05:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
they do they operate with a lot of
 
05:38:03.150 --> 05:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
Independence but we meet with the County
 
05:38:05.030 --> 05:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys I meet with them every other
 
05:38:06.990 --> 05:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
month we talk about the cases that are
 
05:38:09.070 --> 05:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
going on around the state we talk about
 
05:38:11.590 --> 05:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
strategies talk about ways to just keep
 
05:38:13.470 --> 05:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
what we're doing consistent across the
 
05:38:15.310 --> 05:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
state every county is a little bit
 
05:38:19.310 --> 05:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
different and of course uh depending on
 
05:38:21.430 --> 05:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
how a judge or judges in particular
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
counties are cases might be might
 
05:38:25.590 --> 05:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
proceed a little bit differently you
 
05:38:26.510 --> 05:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
might get a little bit different
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
outcomes but for the most part things
 
05:38:30.510 --> 05:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
are pretty consistent throughout the
 
05:38:32.230 --> 05:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
state and we try to stay coordinated
 
05:38:33.868 --> 05:38:33.878 align:start position:0%
with prosecutors around the state to
 
05:38:36.590 --> 05:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
keep that keep that the case the
 
05:38:37.750 --> 05:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is also the the chief
 
05:38:41.230 --> 05:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
legal officer so in that role we both
 
05:38:43.150 --> 05:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
represent the state in civil litigation
 
05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
so we're defending the state when the
 
05:38:47.548 --> 05:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
state gets sued and we represent all
 
05:38:49.310 --> 05:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
three branches of government in that
 
05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
capacity so if if executive branch
 
05:38:53.788 --> 05:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
officials get sued in their official
 
05:38:56.468 --> 05:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
capacity if legislators get sued in your
 
05:38:58.830 --> 05:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
official capacity we we might represent
 
05:39:01.468 --> 05:39:01.478 align:start position:0%
you we actually sometimes represent
 
05:39:03.910 --> 05:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
judges or members of the J other staff
 
05:39:06.990 --> 05:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch when they're sued
 
05:39:07.000 --> 05:39:07.868 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch when they're sued
uh

05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:39:10.670 --> 05:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
over you know administrative things
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
right so if if a if a judge for instance
 
05:39:15.910 --> 05:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
is sued because there's an alligation
 
05:39:17.468 --> 05:39:17.478 align:start position:0%
that they did something inappropriate
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
with some employment process we might be
 
05:39:22.070 --> 05:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
representing that judge if we represent
 
05:39:23.868 --> 05:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
that judge we make sure that the lawyers
 
05:39:25.830 --> 05:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
who are representing that judge don't
 
05:39:27.270 --> 05:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
appear in front of that judge either
 
05:39:28.708 --> 05:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
while they're representing that judge or
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
anytime close to when they represent
 
05:39:33.468 --> 05:39:33.478 align:start position:0%
that judge but it's a pretty broad role
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the office has to represent the
 
05:39:37.468 --> 05:39:37.478 align:start position:0%
state when the state gets sued the
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
office also acts as a client counselor
 
05:39:42.990 --> 05:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
for executive branch agencies and the
 
05:39:44.468 --> 05:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
judicial branch sometimes the
 
05:39:46.590 --> 05:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
legislature so not necessarily
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
representing you in in court but just
 
05:39:52.110 --> 05:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
giving legal advice weighing in on on
 
05:39:55.708 --> 05:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
things um helping make sure things stay
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
legal so that we don't get sued so I
 
05:39:59.868 --> 05:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
think of the client counseling function
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
as the function that tries to prevent
 
05:40:02.830 --> 05:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
the state from getting sued in the first
 
05:40:05.230 --> 05:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
place the litigation function is the
 
05:40:07.468 --> 05:40:07.478 align:start position:0%
part of us that represents the state in
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
court if we if we do end up getting
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
sued the other two roles of the AG uh I
 
05:40:17.070 --> 05:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
I I like to think of another role as
 
05:40:18.670 --> 05:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
being the chief public Protection
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
Officer so that that's slightly
 
05:40:21.750 --> 05:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
different from being the chief law
 
05:40:24.030 --> 05:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer the chief prosecutor
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
because we do a lot of public protection
 
05:40:28.590 --> 05:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
functions that some might not think of
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
as law enforcement or prosecutorial
 
05:40:32.510 --> 05:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
functions but they are public protection
 
05:40:34.670 --> 05:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
functions one example is the charitable
 
05:40:37.390 --> 05:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
trust unit overseeing the charities in
 
05:40:40.750 --> 05:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
the state um both assisting Charities
 
05:40:42.670 --> 05:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
and also ensuring they comply with the
 
05:40:44.990 --> 05:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
law taking enforcement action if
 
05:40:47.270 --> 05:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
necessary if someone is embezzling funds
 
05:40:51.788 --> 05:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
from a charity or or uh more I would say
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
the more uh public protection non
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial function is maybe doing a
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
civil enforcement action if a board of
 
05:40:59.390 --> 05:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
directors is not fulfilling its
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
fiduciary obl obligations to a charity
 
05:41:04.230 --> 05:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
another example is Environmental
 
05:41:06.868 --> 05:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
Protection it's not most of the time a
 
05:41:08.670 --> 05:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
criminal function but it is a public
 
05:41:09.990 --> 05:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
protection function if someone's
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
violating the environmental laws of the
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
state and we take some type of civil
 
05:41:15.628 --> 05:41:15.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement action get a civil penalty
 
05:41:18.070 --> 05:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's a public protection function it's
 
05:41:20.468 --> 05:41:20.478 align:start position:0%
not what people think of necessarily
 
05:41:21.788 --> 05:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
when they think of the the law
 
05:41:24.030 --> 05:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement or prosecutorial function
 
05:41:25.750 --> 05:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not a it's not a criminal
 
05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
action and then of course the attorney
 
05:41:29.788 --> 05:41:29.798 align:start position:0%
general has to be the head of a
 
05:41:31.548 --> 05:41:31.558 align:start position:0%
department so the fifth job of the
 
05:41:32.910 --> 05:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is to to be a
 
05:41:34.190 --> 05:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
department head so all the
 
05:41:36.190 --> 05:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
administrative work that comes along
 
05:41:39.230 --> 05:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you Mr chairman
 
05:41:44.190 --> 05:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr attorney general AB um the
 
05:41:46.510 --> 05:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
the could you could you talk a little
 
05:41:48.468 --> 05:41:48.478 align:start position:0%
bit more about the the relationship
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
between your office and the and the
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
County attorneys
 
05:41:56.110 --> 05:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I guess what I'm trying to
 
05:41:58.390 --> 05:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
understand is it's not the same as the
 
05:42:01.190 --> 05:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
federal state relationship right because
 
05:42:02.670 --> 05:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
I mean you're you're both within the
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
same jurisdiction you're both I guess
 
05:42:06.990 --> 05:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the same set of laws yes
 
05:42:07.000 --> 05:42:08.070 align:start position:0%
responsible for the same set of laws yes
um

05:42:08.070 --> 05:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:42:11.310 --> 05:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
um my questions are you know kind of an
 
05:42:13.868 --> 05:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
organizational one which is you know do
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
you have you know as the chief
 
05:42:19.788 --> 05:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting officer do you have um kind
 
05:42:22.310 --> 05:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
of ultimate say over what they can and
 
05:42:25.468 --> 05:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
can't do uh and what areas do they
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
pursue versus what areas do your
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney generals pursue yep
 
05:42:31.150 --> 05:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
it's a great question thank thank you
 
05:42:34.350 --> 05:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative so I'll start with with
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
the the broad uh sort of the broad
 
05:42:39.628 --> 05:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
authority of the AG the attorney general
 
05:42:43.788 --> 05:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
has uh broad jurisdiction in this state
 
05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
so ultimate responsibility for the
 
05:42:47.830 --> 05:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution of the criminal laws rests
 
05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general but the County
 
05:42:51.868 --> 05:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
attorneys are independently elected and
 
05:42:54.468 --> 05:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys and other local
 
05:42:56.788 --> 05:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
prosecutors they handle most of the
 
05:42:56.798 --> 05:42:59.070 align:start position:0%
prosecutors they handle most of the
criminal

05:42:59.070 --> 05:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
cases they operate independently most of
 
05:43:05.948 --> 05:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
the time they set their own priorities
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
they determine you know how they're
 
05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
going to approach cases they make the
 
05:43:12.910 --> 05:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
county attorney will make the ultimate
 
05:43:15.468 --> 05:43:15.478 align:start position:0%
decision for uh whether they're going to
 
05:43:17.590 --> 05:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
resolve cases in their particular County
 
05:43:19.230 --> 05:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
whether they're going to try the cases
 
05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
what type of sentences they're they're
 
05:43:25.110 --> 05:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
going to pursue um that said if
 
05:43:26.910 --> 05:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
something is not going well in a
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
particular County or there are issues
 
05:43:30.468 --> 05:43:30.478 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General can step in and
 
05:43:32.110 --> 05:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
assume control of those functions it
 
05:43:34.430 --> 05:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen often it happens from
 
05:43:36.310 --> 05:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
time to time so the attorney general has
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
ultimate control
 
05:43:40.910 --> 05:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
over that but but largely though that
 
05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
function is delegated to to County
 
05:43:47.910 --> 05:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys the AG does have to
 
05:43:50.270 --> 05:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
approve the hiring of assistant County
 
05:43:51.990 --> 05:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys so any assistant County
 
05:43:53.590 --> 05:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
attorney in the state that's hired comes
 
05:43:55.390 --> 05:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
through our office and we review that
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we sign off on those hires and like
 
05:44:00.910 --> 05:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
I said we do do a lot of coordination
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
and training but um did does that cover
 
05:44:05.750 --> 05:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
your question I might have missed a
 
05:44:07.948 --> 05:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
couple parts of it um yeah that I guess
 
05:44:11.750 --> 05:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
the one question is um you know when
 
05:44:14.390 --> 05:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
does you know you if you watch TV you've
 
05:44:15.708 --> 05:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
got the County Prosecutors is
 
05:44:16.910 --> 05:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting a case but then there are
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
certain cases where the Assistant
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is Prosecuting the case
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
what what who determines that yeah so
 
05:44:25.150 --> 05:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
there are there is a relatively select
 
05:44:27.190 --> 05:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
category of cases where we we handle the
 
05:44:29.868 --> 05:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
cases exclusively one example are murder
 
05:44:33.150 --> 05:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
cases so second deegree murder and up we
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
do all of those cases so if it's a
 
05:44:36.788 --> 05:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
second deegree murder case or first
 
05:44:39.708 --> 05:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
degree murder case that that will be our
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
office we exclusively handle public
 
05:44:44.750 --> 05:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
Integrity cases involving law
 
05:44:47.510 --> 05:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers or state officials
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's our office we do Medicaid
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
fraud control so if it if there's a
 
05:44:55.468 --> 05:44:55.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud criminal case that will
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
be just our office we do I would say the
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
most significant drug cases the county
 
05:45:04.030 --> 05:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys do Mo the vast
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
majority of the drug cases but we do
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of the more significant drug
 
05:45:10.468 --> 05:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
cases we right now we're handling the
 
05:45:12.628 --> 05:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
YDC cases that's that's a unique
 
05:45:14.430 --> 05:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
situation we normally would not do
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
sexual assault cases but this is a I
 
05:45:19.948 --> 05:45:19.958 align:start position:0%
think for obvious reasons a that's a
 
05:45:22.070 --> 05:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
unique set of circumstances and a very
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
complicated situation so we are we're
 
05:45:28.030 --> 05:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
handling that so those are the those are
 
05:45:31.230 --> 05:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
the types of criminal cases that that we
 
05:45:34.190 --> 05:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we do that said if there's a unique
 
05:45:36.350 --> 05:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
type of situation where we need to step
 
05:45:38.510 --> 05:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
in might not fall into one of those
 
05:45:41.030 --> 05:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
categories we may take the case we'll
 
05:45:43.868 --> 05:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes take a white collar type theft
 
05:45:45.868 --> 05:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
case or something like that that would
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
normally be handled by the County
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney if it's complicated enough that
 
05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
you need the resources of the Department
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
of Justice to handle it so you have you
 
05:45:55.350 --> 05:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
have the right and the ability to to to
 
05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
step in at any point say yep we're going
 
05:45:59.110 --> 05:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
to take that one opposed to you Mr
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
County attorney cor yes and we also
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
handle all of the Criminal Appeals so
 
05:46:05.510 --> 05:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
any criminal case in the state if
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's an appeal our Criminal Appeals
 
05:46:10.788 --> 05:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
Unit handles handles
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
those does that is that possibly
 
05:46:15.788 --> 05:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
inefficient in the sense that your
 
05:46:17.468 --> 05:46:17.478 align:start position:0%
attorney hasn't necessarily worked on
 
05:46:19.868 --> 05:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
the case whereas the county person has
 
05:46:22.990 --> 05:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
and has all the experience and so
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
on I actually think overall it's a very
 
05:46:28.190 --> 05:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
efficient way to do it you know there
 
05:46:30.070 --> 05:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
that sometimes can present some
 
05:46:32.310 --> 05:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
challenges where we haven't tried the
 
05:46:34.830 --> 05:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
case but we're handling the appeal that
 
05:46:36.990 --> 05:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
said when you're deciding whether to
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
take an appeal in a case and you're
 
05:46:40.110 --> 05:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
deciding what arguments to make you
 
05:46:42.510 --> 05:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
really want to be uniform across the
 
05:46:45.868 --> 05:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
state you wouldn't want different
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
counties taking different positions on
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
appeal before The Supreme Court I think
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
you you want to have a central spot
 
05:46:54.750 --> 05:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
where you're determining what issues
 
05:46:56.150 --> 05:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to take up what positions
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
are you going to take tracking the
 
05:46:59.910 --> 05:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
results of various appeals so you can
 
05:47:02.430 --> 05:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
track the state of the law and of course
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
our goal as the Attorney General's
 
05:47:05.948 --> 05:47:05.958 align:start position:0%
office is to try to shape the law in a
 
05:47:07.948 --> 05:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
way that's favorable to law enforcement
 
05:47:10.310 --> 05:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
and criminal prosecution so I I think
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's actually a good way to operate
 
05:47:14.030 --> 05:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
every now and then there can be
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
challenges with the fact that we didn't
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
try the case but in this state we're
 
05:47:18.910 --> 05:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
pretty well integrated with the county
 
05:47:21.390 --> 05:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
attorney offices we're we're not we're
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
not an enormous State either population
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
wise or or Geographic wise we talk to
 
05:47:28.350 --> 05:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
the County attorneys a lot and there's a
 
05:47:31.070 --> 05:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
lot of good coordination back and forth
 
05:47:32.788 --> 05:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
and I suppose also there might be some
 
05:47:36.070 --> 05:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
cases where um the County Attorney would
 
05:47:38.350 --> 05:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
want to appear appeal lost the case and
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
would want to appeal and you look at it
 
05:47:43.590 --> 05:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
and say this this isn't that great a
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
case and therefore we're going to pass
 
05:47:47.910 --> 05:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
or something like that correct there are
 
05:47:50.270 --> 05:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
times when we might look at it and and
 
05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
we and we the County Attorney lost and
 
05:47:56.110 --> 05:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
we say well we we we think you lost and
 
05:47:57.750 --> 05:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
you probably should have lost right we
 
05:48:00.670 --> 05:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
don't think an appeal is warranted or
 
05:48:02.510 --> 05:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
even if we think maybe the judge got it
 
05:48:04.548 --> 05:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
wrong it's just not a good situation
 
05:48:06.310 --> 05:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
which to take an appeal we'll wait for a
 
05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
different case to appeal that issue
 
05:48:11.468 --> 05:48:11.478 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you Mr chair how
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
many employees do you have and what's uh
 
05:48:15.310 --> 05:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
do you have any positions that are
 
05:48:17.150 --> 05:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
vacant I did see one on the or chart for
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
a training attorney yeah and and just to
 
05:48:21.868 --> 05:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of the questions I was going to
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
get to I'm happy to answer them now but
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
but I I'm but I'll answer that so we
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
have if you count temporary positions I
 
05:48:30.350 --> 05:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
think we have
 
05:48:34.270 --> 05:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
213 total positions permanent positions
 
05:48:35.548 --> 05:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
I believe it's
 
05:48:39.910 --> 05:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
195 yeah and I think our vacancies are
 
05:48:41.590 --> 05:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
with permanent positions I think it's
 
05:48:44.548 --> 05:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
it's 19 it's 18 or 19 vacancies out of
 
05:48:48.110 --> 05:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
the permanent positions are those all
 
05:48:50.990 --> 05:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
full-time full fulltime yeah these are
 
05:48:53.788 --> 05:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
all yeah so 195 permanent full-time
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
positions I believe is it 19 vacancies
 
05:49:00.830 --> 05:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.430 --> 05:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
there yeah 19 vacancies which is a
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:15.230 --> 05:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
rate continue with the presentation okay
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
great so the next slide we've got here
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
is just uh who does the Attorney General
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
represent and I know I kind of already
 
05:49:24.350 --> 05:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
covered that so we we represent in in
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
many cases State officials either in the
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislative branch executive branch or
 
05:49:29.200 --> 05:49:30.788 align:start position:0%
legislative branch executive branch or
judicial

05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
branch on the next next slide or other
 
05:49:35.510 --> 05:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
side of that slide we represent the
 
05:49:35.520 --> 05:49:37.150 align:start position:0%
side of that slide we represent the
public

05:49:37.150 --> 05:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
so in discrimination claims we represent
 
05:49:41.110 --> 05:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
the public in our law enforcement
 
05:49:44.030 --> 05:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
function we represent the public in our
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
charitable trust oversight function we
 
05:49:48.150 --> 05:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
represent the public in our through our
 
05:49:49.948 --> 05:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau protecting
 
05:49:52.270 --> 05:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
consumers we represent the public in
 
05:49:55.590 --> 05:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
election law enforcement we and uh we
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
represent the public it's kind of
 
05:50:01.390 --> 05:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
covered above but in in a civil rights
 
05:50:03.390 --> 05:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement on the next slide I just
 
05:50:05.548 --> 05:50:05.558 align:start position:0%
have a little bit here about client
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
service versus independent obligations
 
05:50:09.948 --> 05:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
and Authority so at the Attorney
 
05:50:11.390 --> 05:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
General's office we're always thinking
 
05:50:13.468 --> 05:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
carefully about how to balance our role
 
05:50:16.468 --> 05:50:16.478 align:start position:0%
as being the lawyer for the state so
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
having clients who who are State
 
05:50:23.310 --> 05:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
officials and and who we work for and we
 
05:50:25.868 --> 05:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
try to help them get done what they want
 
05:50:28.270 --> 05:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
to get done within the bounds of the law
 
05:50:30.910 --> 05:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
we balance those obligations with what
 
05:50:34.948 --> 05:50:34.958 align:start position:0%
we see as an independent obligation from
 
05:50:37.390 --> 05:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
Our obligation to our clients
 
05:50:40.230 --> 05:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the law is being complied
 
05:50:43.628 --> 05:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
with to act in the public
 
05:50:45.868 --> 05:50:45.878 align:start position:0%
interest conduct our law enforcement
 
05:50:47.390 --> 05:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
functions so enforce the laws of the
 
05:50:50.910 --> 05:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
state protect the public determine the
 
05:50:52.750 --> 05:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
best legal position for the state to
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
take so there there are times it doesn't
 
05:50:56.430 --> 05:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
happen that often but there are times
 
05:50:58.110 --> 05:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
when a when an agency when a
 
05:50:59.670 --> 05:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner wants to take a certain
 
05:51:02.590 --> 05:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
legal position and we will not agree
 
05:51:04.350 --> 05:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
with that and we'll say we're we're not
 
05:51:05.510 --> 05:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to take that position we're going
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
to take this position because we think
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
it's in the state's overall best
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
interest to take this position those
 
05:51:12.468 --> 05:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
disputes don't happen often but when
 
05:51:15.310 --> 05:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
they do it's It ultimately falls to the
 
05:51:17.670 --> 05:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general to to resolve that
 
05:51:19.510 --> 05:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
there are also times when state agencies
 
05:51:22.110 --> 05:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
want to take contrary positions in in a
 
05:51:23.910 --> 05:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
particular matter they might actually be
 
05:51:26.708 --> 05:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
litigating against each other or they
 
05:51:28.708 --> 05:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
may have a different view on a certain
 
05:51:29.788 --> 05:51:29.798 align:start position:0%
question of
 
05:51:32.670 --> 05:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
law when a case comes up and they each
 
05:51:34.310 --> 05:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
have different opinions as to say what
 
05:51:35.788 --> 05:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
we should argue to the state supreme
 
05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
court the AG or the Attorney General's
 
05:51:41.270 --> 05:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
office has the role of resolving those
 
05:51:42.990 --> 05:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
disputes and having to make the decision
 
05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
as to what's what's the best position to
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
take given all of the interests involved
 
05:51:51.270 --> 05:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
so it really is it's it's a it's a
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
function that requires us to try to
 
05:51:58.708 --> 05:51:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:00.670 --> 05:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
balancing thank you thanks for taking
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
the question again um so you know you
 
05:52:07.910 --> 05:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
the state is your
 
05:52:11.628 --> 05:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
client but who within the state I mean
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
you know what if and I guess what I'm
 
05:52:15.990 --> 05:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting at is what if the executive
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
branch and the legislative branch have a
 
05:52:20.110 --> 05:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion and the
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
legislative branch for example wants the
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
AG to do this and the governor wants you
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
to do that how does that get
 
05:52:31.230 --> 05:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
resolved yeah like I said I think it
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
gets resolved if there is that type of
 
05:52:37.190 --> 05:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
conflict by the the attorney general
 
05:52:38.910 --> 05:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
need to needing to determine what's in
 
05:52:40.990 --> 05:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
the state's best interests now the
 
05:52:42.788 --> 05:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
Attorney General is also a member of the
 
05:52:46.110 --> 05:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
executive branch right so in many way in
 
05:52:50.070 --> 05:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
many ways subordinate to the governor um
 
05:52:51.310 --> 05:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
when you look at the history of the
 
05:52:52.708 --> 05:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
position of attorney general in this
 
05:52:54.110 --> 05:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
state and other states it's it's
 
05:52:56.590 --> 05:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
interesting because there I've always
 
05:52:59.468 --> 05:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
viewed it as many many functions the
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General needs to follow the
 
05:53:03.430 --> 05:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
directive of of the governor that said
 
05:53:05.590 --> 05:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
there are just some some
 
05:53:08.150 --> 05:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that exist going back
 
05:53:09.910 --> 05:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
to the common law that haven't really
 
05:53:11.788 --> 05:53:11.798 align:start position:0%
been changed in the state either by
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
Statute or or the Constitution that
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
involved you know the Attorney General's
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
obligation to act in the best interest
 
05:53:20.990 --> 05:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the public and and the state so I I
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
think ultimately if you're the AG
 
05:53:24.948 --> 05:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
whoever the AG is whoever happens to sit
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the seat just needs to think really
 
05:53:29.590 --> 05:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
carefully about what the issue is and
 
05:53:30.910 --> 05:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's one of those issues where
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
they need to take the direction of say
 
05:53:34.350 --> 05:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
the chief executive of the executive
 
05:53:36.830 --> 05:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
branch or whether it's a unique issue in
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
which they need to independently
 
05:53:41.628 --> 05:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
determine what the best course of action
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
is and it depends on on the category of
 
05:53:49.070 --> 05:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
of uh of Duty to in the in the criminal
 
05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
law realm in the law enforcement
 
05:53:52.310 --> 05:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
criminal law realm I think the Attorney
 
05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
General really acts independently even
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
of the governor in the Civil realm where
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
the AG is acting as the lawyer for the
 
05:54:01.070 --> 05:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
executive branch I think the Attorney
 
05:54:03.990 --> 05:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
General needs to do what the governor
 
05:54:05.548 --> 05:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
tells him or her to do because the
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
governor is the chief executive of the
 
05:54:10.510 --> 05:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
executive branch right if it's a dispute
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
between two branches of government then
 
05:54:15.628 --> 05:54:15.638 align:start position:0%
it gets more complicated so it you just
 
05:54:17.948 --> 05:54:17.958 align:start position:0%
you there are some there can be some
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
complicated questions some tough
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
judgment calls and you just have to
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
think really hard about it and and make
 
05:54:27.628 --> 05:54:27.638 align:start position:0%
the right
 
05:54:29.948 --> 05:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
call I think you answered my question I
 
05:54:31.590 --> 05:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
mean and I I think you're right I mean
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
you you are a member of the executive
 
05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
branch yes ult ultimately that's kind of
 
05:54:39.310 --> 05:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's where where it sits so y I
 
05:54:40.788 --> 05:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
understand y thank you you have a
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
five-year term fouryear term four years
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay and um I think the Attorney General
 
05:54:49.868 --> 05:54:49.878 align:start position:0%
is mentioned in the Constitution yes yes
 
05:54:51.468 --> 05:54:51.478 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is mentioned in the
 
05:54:53.708 --> 05:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution there's no specific duties
 
05:54:56.468 --> 05:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
set out for the AG in the Constitution
 
05:55:00.350 --> 05:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
so there are common law Powers uh that
 
05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
predate the Constitution and our
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
statutes but there are a lot of Duties
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
and authorities that are laid out in in
 
05:55:11.110 --> 05:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:14.430 --> 05:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
thank so the next slide we get into just
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
the the core structure of of the
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and this is just
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
going into a little more detail than
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
what we had on the uh the org
 
05:55:25.868 --> 05:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
chart so for many of the substantive
 
05:55:28.030 --> 05:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
functions for the core uh of the
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
department were broken down into two
 
05:55:32.030 --> 05:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
divisions the first division is the
 
05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
division of public protection with a
 
05:55:36.270 --> 05:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
couple of exceptions this is basic
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
basically where the criminal and law
 
05:55:40.670 --> 05:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement functions of the department
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
live the biggest bureau by far in the
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
office is the criminal justice Bureau
 
05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
and this has the homicide unit the drug
 
05:55:52.468 --> 05:55:52.478 align:start position:0%
unit the public Integrity unit the
 
05:55:55.270 --> 05:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud control unit we have a
 
05:55:57.868 --> 05:55:57.878 align:start position:0%
YDC unit right now that's a temporary
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
unit but we think of it as it as its own
 
05:56:03.628 --> 05:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
as its own unit um so this this it has
 
05:56:06.830 --> 05:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
multiple units that deal with various
 
05:56:09.948 --> 05:56:09.958 align:start position:0%
categories of of criminal cases we have
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection antitrust
 
05:56:16.030 --> 05:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau this is a this is a large Bureau
 
05:56:18.788 --> 05:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
it does Elder elder abuse and financial
 
05:56:21.310 --> 05:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
exploitation uh does Consumer prot kind
 
05:56:23.548 --> 05:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
of classic consumer protection cases
 
05:56:26.190 --> 05:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
like going after contractors who rip
 
05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
people off you know promise to fix your
 
05:56:29.670 --> 05:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
roof and take the money that you pay
 
05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
them and never do the work we do those
 
05:56:35.070 --> 05:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
types of cases we do antitrust cases in
 
05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
the Consumer Protection Bureau
 
05:56:38.948 --> 05:56:38.958 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that come up a lot in
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
hospital mergers the Consumer Protection
 
05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau is one of the bureaus that
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
reviews Hospital mergers to determine
 
05:56:47.830 --> 05:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
whether the merger violates antitrust
 
05:56:50.030 --> 05:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
law by reducing competition in our
 
05:56:52.468 --> 05:56:52.478 align:start position:0%
healthc care market so the Consumer
 
05:56:54.230 --> 05:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau is is is the next
 
05:56:55.990 --> 05:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
biggest bureau in the office after the
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Bureau and that uh
 
05:56:59.948 --> 05:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
division of public protection also has
 
05:57:02.230 --> 05:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau so
 
05:57:03.670 --> 05:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
the Environmental Protection Bureau is
 
05:57:06.430 --> 05:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
not really a criminal law Bureau but it
 
05:57:07.910 --> 05:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
lives in the division of public
 
05:57:10.270 --> 05:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
protection because there
 
05:57:13.190 --> 05:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
are rare instances where we can bring
 
05:57:15.468 --> 05:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
criminal cases in the environmental
 
05:57:17.628 --> 05:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
context we only do that in really
 
05:57:20.070 --> 05:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
egregious cases where where someone
 
05:57:23.468 --> 05:57:23.478 align:start position:0%
might you know may may actually like a a
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
human being may suffer immediate and
 
05:57:28.390 --> 05:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
direct harm that that can happen every
 
05:57:30.430 --> 05:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
now and then in the environmental
 
05:57:32.708 --> 05:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
context the other
 
05:57:35.390 --> 05:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
division that houses most of the rest of
 
05:57:36.910 --> 05:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
the office is the division of legal
 
05:57:39.990 --> 05:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
counsel so this with a couple of
 
05:57:42.190 --> 05:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
exceptions mostly has the Civil
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
functions of the office so the civil law
 
05:57:48.990 --> 05:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau which does client counseling and
 
05:57:51.070 --> 05:57:51.080 align:start position:0%
and civil litigation as I talked about
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
so both advises State officials and
 
05:57:55.868 --> 05:57:55.878 align:start position:0%
tries to prevent us from getting sued
 
05:57:57.670 --> 05:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then defending State officials if we
 
05:58:00.510 --> 05:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
do get sued that's the civil law
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
Bureau representative cambrell thank you
 
05:58:05.670 --> 05:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I apologize but just going back
 
05:58:07.788 --> 05:58:07.798 align:start position:0%
one to the Environmental Protection
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau would you get referrals from Dees
 
05:58:13.230 --> 05:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
or can uh citizens reach out to you
 
05:58:15.390 --> 05:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
directly for something citizens can
 
05:58:17.468 --> 05:58:17.478 align:start position:0%
reach out to us directly but a lot of
 
05:58:19.868 --> 05:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
our cases in that Bureau do come through
 
05:58:24.030 --> 05:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
referral from Dees okay thank you
 
05:58:27.750 --> 05:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
yep representative R thank you and um
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
following up um on that question
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
so some of the um statutes on
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
Environmental protection rely on peace
 
05:58:42.190 --> 05:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
officers to enforce it um which I I'm
 
05:58:44.310 --> 05:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
assuming is any law enforcement anybody
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
who has the ability to arrest somebody
 
05:58:48.590 --> 05:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the state do you inter any interface
 
05:58:51.230 --> 05:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
at all with any of those cases I mean it
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
could be somebody that's clear cutting a
 
05:58:56.190 --> 05:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
Shoreland or something like that sure
 
05:59:00.628 --> 05:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes it it it's fairly rare
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
from at least in my experience that
 
05:59:06.230 --> 05:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
police off peace officers police
 
05:59:08.350 --> 05:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
officers are involved in environmental
 
05:59:09.750 --> 05:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
CA in the environmental cases at least
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
that we work on but it it does happen
 
05:59:13.788 --> 05:59:13.798 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
05:59:16.430 --> 05:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
usually usually the way a a an
 
05:59:17.868 --> 05:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
environmental case that our office
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
handles arises comes through Dees so
 
05:59:23.510 --> 05:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
somebody will report to Dees that
 
05:59:26.590 --> 05:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
someone has is either uh not handling
 
05:59:28.990 --> 05:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
their hazardous waste correctly or they
 
05:59:31.070 --> 05:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
not handling storm water correctly or
 
05:59:33.628 --> 05:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
they're they've got a discharge into a
 
05:59:35.190 --> 05:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
body of water that they shouldn't have
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
you know something looks funny to them
 
05:59:41.150 --> 05:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
they report it to Dees Dees investigates
 
05:59:43.310 --> 05:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
they can investigate with the assistance
 
05:59:44.990 --> 05:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
of local law enforcement if they need to
 
05:59:47.788 --> 05:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
but they investigate and if they put
 
05:59:49.788 --> 05:59:49.798 align:start position:0%
together a case that they think needs to
 
05:59:51.628 --> 05:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
be where enforcement action needs to
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
happen they refer it to us and we take
 
05:59:56.190 --> 05:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
it from there working with them okay I
 
05:59:59.548 --> 05:59:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:02.070 --> 06:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
yep uh the next Bureau and I actually I
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't update this from two
 
06:00:05.468 --> 06:00:05.478 align:start position:0%
years ago because we've changed the name
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
of this buau bu but this is the public
 
06:00:09.708 --> 06:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
safety and infrastructure Bureau used to
 
06:00:11.548 --> 06:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
be called transportation and
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
construction this Bureau represents the
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the Department
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
of Transportation so they do both
 
06:00:19.990 --> 06:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
litigation and client counseling for
 
06:00:22.110 --> 06:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
those two
 
06:00:23.868 --> 06:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
departments uh the division of legal
 
06:00:25.190 --> 06:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
council also has the charitable trust
 
06:00:27.548 --> 06:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
unit the charitable trust unit carries
 
06:00:30.670 --> 06:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
out what is uh perhaps the oldest
 
06:00:31.990 --> 06:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
function actually of the Attorney
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
General in Most states which is to
 
06:00:37.468 --> 06:00:37.478 align:start position:0%
oversee charities so they Charities are
 
06:00:42.910 --> 06:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
kind of this interesting uh quasi public
 
06:00:45.350 --> 06:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
private asset and the the Attorney
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
General at the end of the day if
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
something goes wrong with a charity is
 
06:00:52.670 --> 06:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
the enforcement is the enforcement arm
 
06:00:55.628 --> 06:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
that comes in and tries to set things
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
right uh the debt Recovery Unit also
 
06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
exists in the division of legal council
 
06:01:01.510 --> 06:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what it sounds like if
 
06:01:03.190 --> 06:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
there are debts owed to the state that
 
06:01:06.270 --> 06:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
haven't been paid and and haven't been
 
06:01:07.948 --> 06:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
able to be collected through other
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
mechanisms through various departments
 
06:01:12.590 --> 06:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
we have a debt Recovery Unit that can
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
take action to try to recover debts owed
 
06:01:17.110 --> 06:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
to the state often if it gets to that
 
06:01:19.468 --> 06:01:19.478 align:start position:0%
point the amount we're collecting is you
 
06:01:21.590 --> 06:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
know Pennies on the Pennies on the
 
06:01:23.830 --> 06:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
dollar but it's better than nothing you
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
know it's better than I'd rather collect
 
06:01:27.628 --> 06:01:27.638 align:start position:0%
some amount of money than than no amount
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
of money even if it's only a small
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of of what's owed so that's
 
06:01:34.230 --> 06:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
the debt Recovery Unit and then we have
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
the election law unit is in the division
 
06:01:38.070 --> 06:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
of legal council this is one of the
 
06:01:40.270 --> 06:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions I talked about we do bring
 
06:01:42.190 --> 06:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
criminal cases and our election law unit
 
06:01:44.110 --> 06:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
I think as most people know it's
 
06:01:46.628 --> 06:01:46.638 align:start position:0%
actually housed in the Civil part of the
 
06:01:48.670 --> 06:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
office since that unit does both civil
 
06:01:50.590 --> 06:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
and criminal but the election law unit
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
is in the division of legal council and
 
06:01:53.590 --> 06:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
then the Civil Rights unit is in the
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
division of legal council the Civil
 
06:01:58.910 --> 06:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
Rights unit only brings civil actions so
 
06:02:01.030 --> 06:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
we file a civil rights action it it can
 
06:02:03.190 --> 06:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
kind of look and sound like a criminal
 
06:02:06.390 --> 06:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
case but it's a civil action so we not
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
charging somebody with a crime we are
 
06:02:10.750 --> 06:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
trying to stop them from violating the
 
06:02:13.110 --> 06:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
Civil Rights Act and perhaps seeking
 
06:02:16.230 --> 06:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
fines and other relief uh as a
 
06:02:18.030 --> 06:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
consequence for violating thei violating
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights Act but it's not a
 
06:02:21.390 --> 06:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
criminal function in the
 
06:02:23.468 --> 06:02:23.478 align:start position:0%
office there's a couple there's a few
 
06:02:24.830 --> 06:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
other parts of the office that exist
 
06:02:26.590 --> 06:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
outside of those cases that come from
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission is
 
06:02:32.030 --> 06:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
that not really the Civil Rights unit
 
06:02:34.230 --> 06:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
provides client counseling to the Human
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission but the the the Civil
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
Rights unit brings cases on its own
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
every now and then we may hear of
 
06:02:42.750 --> 06:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
something through the Human Rights
 
06:02:44.510 --> 06:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
Commission but the Human Rights
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
Commission is more of an adjudicatory
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
body so that's where somebody goes if
 
06:02:51.868 --> 06:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
they say a business let's like let's say
 
06:02:54.350 --> 06:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
my employer discriminated against me in
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
the hiring process or um this hotel
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
would not rent me a room because you
 
06:03:02.910 --> 06:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm part of a protected class you
 
06:03:04.468 --> 06:03:04.478 align:start position:0%
would file a complaint with the Human
 
06:03:08.030 --> 06:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission the Civil Rights Act
 
06:03:11.750 --> 06:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
those actions are more like somebody uh
 
06:03:13.948 --> 06:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
caused physical harm to me because I'm
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
part I'm you know part of a protected
 
06:03:19.030 --> 06:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
class or they damaged my property
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
because I'm part of a protected class or
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
they trespassed on my property and
 
06:03:24.190 --> 06:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
harassed me because I'm part of a
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
protected class that's the Civil Rights
 
06:03:28.510 --> 06:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
action so they're they're similar things
 
06:03:31.190 --> 06:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
but they're they're different so one's
 
06:03:34.110 --> 06:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
more all about employment and the other
 
06:03:38.190 --> 06:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
is other kind of cases is that uh well
 
06:03:40.350 --> 06:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
emplo yeah employment public
 
06:03:41.990 --> 06:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
accommodations right so being
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in like hotels
 
06:03:44.000 --> 06:03:45.510 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in like hotels
restaurants

06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
06:03:47.948 --> 06:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
housing that's a Human Rights Commission
 
06:03:52.430 --> 06:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so uh not not sort of like
 
06:03:56.510 --> 06:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
damage to sell for property
 
06:03:58.948 --> 06:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
discrimination dis like dis I was
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated against not directly
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
damaged in my either physical physical
 
06:04:07.390 --> 06:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
harm or property damage now is that
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
completely independent of your office
 
06:04:11.390 --> 06:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission they are
 
06:04:13.670 --> 06:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to to the
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
office and that's one of the questions
 
06:04:16.990 --> 06:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
we were asked to address today as to
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
whether we think we we think that makes
 
06:04:22.030 --> 06:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
sense or that should continue yeah so I
 
06:04:24.030 --> 06:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
can address that now or wait till the
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
end yeah as long as we're on it why
 
06:04:28.948 --> 06:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
don't we talk about it yeah yeah so I I
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
think the Human Rights Commission became
 
06:04:33.548 --> 06:04:33.558 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to us pretty
 
06:04:38.670 --> 06:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:41.910 --> 06:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
2020 I am not and and while I was in the
 
06:04:43.510 --> 06:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
governor's office at the time so I
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
confess maybe I should remember why that
 
06:04:48.190 --> 06:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
happened I don't have a very clear
 
06:04:51.670 --> 06:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
memory as to why that happened I I I
 
06:04:53.990 --> 06:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
think there is there's been some thought
 
06:04:55.948 --> 06:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
in the last few years that small
 
06:04:57.468 --> 06:04:57.478 align:start position:0%
agencies that maybe don't have the
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
resources to
 
06:05:01.070 --> 06:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
handle all of the administrative
 
06:05:03.150 --> 06:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
functions you need to handle to to be an
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
independent agency should be attached to
 
06:05:08.670 --> 06:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
some bigger agency that makes sense just
 
06:05:10.270 --> 06:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
for efficiencies so that we don't have
 
06:05:14.430 --> 06:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
to have you know a whole new set of HR
 
06:05:16.150 --> 06:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
and administrative functions for a very
 
06:05:18.990 --> 06:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
small agency and I
 
06:05:22.590 --> 06:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
think when we were looking around at
 
06:05:24.788 --> 06:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
some point a determination was made that
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
Commission needs to remain independent
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
for obvious reasons being it's be its
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
own agency but needs some support and
 
06:05:39.270 --> 06:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
given that it's this adjudicatory body
 
06:05:41.390 --> 06:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
that frankly could have claims from
 
06:05:43.590 --> 06:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
another from a state agency right I mean
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
somebody can bring a Human Rights
 
06:05:48.910 --> 06:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
Commission complaint that involves an
 
06:05:50.350 --> 06:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
allegation that a state agency
 
06:05:52.468 --> 06:05:52.478 align:start position:0%
discriminated against them the thought
 
06:05:54.750 --> 06:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
was the Department of Justice is a good
 
06:05:57.750 --> 06:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
agency to be attached to since we are
 
06:06:00.070 --> 06:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
kind of We're the state law enforcement
 
06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
agency really we the chief law
 
06:06:03.708 --> 06:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
um follow up
 
06:06:08.708 --> 06:06:08.718 align:start position:0%
it does every state have a Human Rights
 
06:06:10.910 --> 06:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
Commission or something
 
06:06:13.430 --> 06:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
similar I don't know the exact answer to
 
06:06:15.468 --> 06:06:15.478 align:start position:0%
that off the top of my head I think Most
 
06:06:18.190 --> 06:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
states do but but I don't know the
 
06:06:19.750 --> 06:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
numbers on that we could get back to you
 
06:06:21.708 --> 06:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
on that I mean is the thought that you
 
06:06:24.430 --> 06:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
have this because otherwise the courts
 
06:06:25.990 --> 06:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be clogged with these kind of
 
06:06:29.110 --> 06:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:31.628 --> 06:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
that as to why the commission exists in
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
the first place yes I think that's part
 
06:06:36.030 --> 06:06:36.040 align:start position:0%
of it I think there's also
 
06:06:39.628 --> 06:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
it's also because of the thought that
 
06:06:41.190 --> 06:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
these are the types of cases where maybe
 
06:06:43.230 --> 06:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
you don't want to make someone go into
 
06:06:45.948 --> 06:06:45.958 align:start position:0%
court that can be intimidating for for
 
06:06:48.430 --> 06:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
people give them a alternative Forum
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
that is kind of like a court but doesn't
 
06:06:54.030 --> 06:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
feel as much like a court as a as a
 
06:06:55.830 --> 06:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
court that you know people might be more
 
06:06:58.510 --> 06:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable bringing a discrimination
 
06:07:02.070 --> 06:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
claim to a body that deals exclusively
 
06:07:04.708 --> 06:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
with discrimination claims than with
 
06:07:08.510 --> 06:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
with a court that is that is more
 
06:07:10.030 --> 06:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
intimidating to people in certain
 
06:07:13.708 --> 06:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances and courts do a do I mean
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
they they adjudicate every type of case
 
06:07:16.830 --> 06:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
right they don't specialize in
 
06:07:19.628 --> 06:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination claims so I think I think
 
06:07:23.350 --> 06:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
that is the thinking behind it um
 
06:07:25.750 --> 06:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
whether that's a policy choice that
 
06:07:26.628 --> 06:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:07:28.948 --> 06:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
reexamined I think is a is a deeper
 
06:07:31.510 --> 06:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
question that might go beyond a budget
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
presentation yeah all right
 
06:07:35.230 --> 06:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative Ms just a follow up on
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
that I mean is the is the the the the
 
06:07:40.948 --> 06:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
service that you're providing to the
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
Human Rights
 
06:07:44.590 --> 06:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
Commission um you know the
 
06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
administrative Services you're providing
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
to them you know what what are those
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
services and does it have anything to do
 
06:07:53.190 --> 06:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
with the law or is it purely
 
06:07:53.200 --> 06:07:55.468 align:start position:0%
with the law or is it purely
administrative

06:07:55.468 --> 06:07:55.478 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
06:07:58.670 --> 06:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's the the services we provide because
 
06:08:00.628 --> 06:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
the HRC is administratively attached to
 
06:08:04.468 --> 06:08:04.478 align:start position:0%
us is purely administrative we do just
 
06:08:06.430 --> 06:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
like we do for every agency provide
 
06:08:08.030 --> 06:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
client counseling services to the Human
 
06:08:08.990 --> 06:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission where we give them
 
06:08:11.590 --> 06:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
legal advice but we do that for every
 
06:08:14.270 --> 06:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
agency not just ones that are attached
 
06:08:16.190 --> 06:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
it's really just it's administrative
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
like accounts payable yeah accounts
 
06:08:23.030 --> 06:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
payable um some employment stuff payroll
 
06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know posting hiring postings we
 
06:08:26.910 --> 06:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
assist them with their budget process
 
06:08:28.590 --> 06:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
all the stuff you went to law school for
 
06:08:32.270 --> 06:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah all the stuff I
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
have to rely on someone else to think
 
06:08:37.070 --> 06:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
about because I went to law school right
 
06:08:40.548 --> 06:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll talk about this after okay go
 
06:08:43.628 --> 06:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
ahead with the rest of it okay on the
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
next slide we just have the the other
 
06:08:47.390 --> 06:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
components of the doj so we have an
 
06:08:49.070 --> 06:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
office of solicitor general that's
 
06:08:52.948 --> 06:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
actually fairly new uh in 2018 the
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
position of solicitor general was
 
06:08:55.788 --> 06:08:55.798 align:start position:0%
established in our office for the first
 
06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
time most attorney general offices
 
06:08:59.830 --> 06:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
around the country have a solicitor
 
06:09:02.270 --> 06:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
general and the solicitor general
 
06:09:03.670 --> 06:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
basically is responsible for all of the
 
06:09:05.788 --> 06:09:05.798 align:start position:0%
appeals in the office so mentioned
 
06:09:07.548 --> 06:09:07.558 align:start position:0%
earlier we do all of the Criminal
 
06:09:10.990 --> 06:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
Appeals for for the state and we also
 
06:09:13.548 --> 06:09:13.558 align:start position:0%
have a lot of big civil cases that that
 
06:09:15.548 --> 06:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
we have appeals for so we have do
 
06:09:17.708 --> 06:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
criminal and Civil Appeals the solicitor
 
06:09:20.948 --> 06:09:20.958 align:start position:0%
general handles that and the office of
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
the solicor general is sort of separate
 
06:09:24.628 --> 06:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
from the division of public protection
 
06:09:26.270 --> 06:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
and division of legal councel because it
 
06:09:29.230 --> 06:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
really does do a lot of criminal work
 
06:09:31.310 --> 06:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
and a lot of civil work so it's it's
 
06:09:33.110 --> 06:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
outside of those two divisions because
 
06:09:36.628 --> 06:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
it because it does both function
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the chief medical examiner
 
06:09:43.270 --> 06:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
is housed Under the doj Umbrella the
 
06:09:46.628 --> 06:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
medical examiner that those are there
 
06:09:48.830 --> 06:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
are forensic Pathologists so they they
 
06:09:52.110 --> 06:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
do autopsies they both investigate uh
 
06:09:54.548 --> 06:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
untimely and suspicious deaths they they
 
06:09:54.558 --> 06:09:55.750 align:start position:0%
untimely and suspicious deaths they they
do

06:09:55.750 --> 06:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
autopsies they are the ones that sign
 
06:10:00.030 --> 06:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
off on death certificates that function
 
06:10:01.868 --> 06:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
is housed within the Department of
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
Justice uh the way the medical examiner
 
06:10:05.750 --> 06:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
puts it which I think is a good way to
 
06:10:06.910 --> 06:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
think about it is they are
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
diagnostically independent
 
06:10:12.708 --> 06:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
meaning they are medical doctors they
 
06:10:14.548 --> 06:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
make determinations as to what they
 
06:10:16.548 --> 06:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
think with regard to autopsies and other
 
06:10:18.868 --> 06:10:18.878 align:start position:0%
scientific questions independently from
 
06:10:22.390 --> 06:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney general but they are
 
06:10:25.468 --> 06:10:25.478 align:start position:0%
administratively um subject to the
 
06:10:27.548 --> 06:10:27.558 align:start position:0%
direction of of the Attorney General
 
06:10:28.708 --> 06:10:28.718 align:start position:0%
ultimately since they're part of the
 
06:10:30.910 --> 06:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
06:10:33.670 --> 06:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
Justice and then we have uh
 
06:10:36.468 --> 06:10:36.478 align:start position:0%
administrative functions so this Kathy
 
06:10:38.190 --> 06:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
is the director of administration
 
06:10:40.830 --> 06:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
oversees the the director of Law Office
 
06:10:42.750 --> 06:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure he's another word for
 
06:10:45.430 --> 06:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
that is he's our Tech guy he's our Tech
 
06:10:48.070 --> 06:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
Guy uh the business office handles
 
06:10:50.910 --> 06:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
payroll and and things like that we have
 
06:10:53.750 --> 06:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
a victims compensation unit so there is
 
06:10:57.190 --> 06:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
a victims compensation fund uh victims
 
06:10:59.468 --> 06:10:59.478 align:start position:0%
of crime in in New Hampshire can seek
 
06:11:01.150 --> 06:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
compensation and reimbursement for
 
06:11:04.030 --> 06:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
certain expenses that they incur as
 
06:11:06.030 --> 06:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
victims of crime that has to be
 
06:11:08.868 --> 06:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
connected to a a Charged case so that
 
06:11:12.030 --> 06:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
only comes into play if we have if we've
 
06:11:14.070 --> 06:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
either charged a criminal case or we we
 
06:11:16.548 --> 06:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be charging it
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't come into play for anyone who
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
might just allege that they're a victim
 
06:11:23.190 --> 06:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
does this sometimes happen at the county
 
06:11:25.708 --> 06:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
level also or is it all done through
 
06:11:25.718 --> 06:11:26.830 align:start position:0%
level also or is it all done through
your

06:11:26.830 --> 06:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:11:29.390 --> 06:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
office victim's compensation is all done
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
through our office okay
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
victim services or victim Advocates
 
06:11:37.868 --> 06:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
exist at the county level I see so if a
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
victim of crime in a Charged case can
 
06:11:43.350 --> 06:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
get assistance from a victim Advocate
 
06:11:44.830 --> 06:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
and the counties have their own victim
 
06:11:46.190 --> 06:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
Advocates so we have our victim
 
06:11:47.708 --> 06:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
Advocates Counties have their victim
 
06:11:49.468 --> 06:11:49.478 align:start position:0%
Advocates they can help connect them
 
06:11:51.230 --> 06:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
with Services navigate the criminal
 
06:11:54.150 --> 06:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
justice process the the victim's
 
06:11:55.788 --> 06:11:55.798 align:start position:0%
compensation that's housed just within
 
06:11:58.390 --> 06:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
our office but it it covers victims for
 
06:12:00.430 --> 06:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
charged crimes whether it's the county
 
06:12:03.110 --> 06:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
attorney who charged charged or or us
 
06:12:04.750 --> 06:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
because I think representative Griffin
 
06:12:07.830 --> 06:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
is uh had a positive experience with
 
06:12:11.510 --> 06:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
this right I mean for you got a check
 
06:12:13.390 --> 06:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
right you didn't you get a check after
 
06:12:17.948 --> 06:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
your car was keyed yeah yeah at at this
 
06:12:17.958 --> 06:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
your car was keyed yeah yeah at at this
Republican

06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
Republican
 
06:12:22.190 --> 06:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
meeting we had the
 
06:12:25.750 --> 06:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
Republican the school there were like 30
 
06:12:27.390 --> 06:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
CS that got
 
06:12:32.430 --> 06:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
key so I put a report in and they told
 
06:12:35.788 --> 06:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
me to get an estimate and it's about a
 
06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
year but last week I went to my mailbox
 
06:12:44.510 --> 06:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
and was $2100 something in my mailbox
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
which interesting yeah I don't think
 
06:12:50.110 --> 06:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
that it's probably just a similar
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
concept that maybe is they had locally
 
06:12:54.270 --> 06:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
but it's not that's not the type of
 
06:12:56.030 --> 06:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
thing our like a Vic our victim's
 
06:12:56.040 --> 06:12:57.310 align:start position:0%
thing our like a Vic our victim's
compensation

06:12:57.310 --> 06:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
06:13:01.868 --> 06:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
unit right he caught the perpetrator yep
 
06:13:06.350 --> 06:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
and he he apparently had asset yep and
 
06:13:09.510 --> 06:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
that will happen uh when when we charge
 
06:13:11.468 --> 06:13:11.478 align:start position:0%
crimes right off and we will try to get
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
to the extent you've you've cause damage
 
06:13:16.708 --> 06:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
to the victim so Financial loss we'll
 
06:13:19.270 --> 06:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
try to get restitution for the victim
 
06:13:22.350 --> 06:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
that though comes from the perpetrator
 
06:13:24.030 --> 06:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
themselves not from the victim's
 
06:13:27.270 --> 06:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
compensation fund which is more for say
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
I'm a victim of crime and because of
 
06:13:31.510 --> 06:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
this I need counseling right so I can go
 
06:13:33.070 --> 06:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
to I can potentially get some money for
 
06:13:35.830 --> 06:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
that from the victim's compensation fund
 
06:13:38.510 --> 06:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a general fund fund is that
 
06:13:40.708 --> 06:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
no no it comes from Criminal criminal
 
06:13:43.390 --> 06:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
fines and penalties get deposited in
 
06:13:45.190 --> 06:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
there yeah which which otherwise would
 
06:13:47.670 --> 06:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
be in the general funds correct yeah I
 
06:13:49.468 --> 06:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
mean money is fungible at the end of the
 
06:13:52.270 --> 06:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
day but it that's it comes directly from
 
06:13:54.750 --> 06:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
that I understand thank you
 
06:13:54.760 --> 06:13:55.910 align:start position:0%
that I understand thank you
representative

06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:13:58.590 --> 06:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
Ms sorry to ask another question I
 
06:14:00.150 --> 06:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
actually I have this question for M Miss
 
06:14:02.468 --> 06:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
Carr if it's all right
 
06:14:07.070 --> 06:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
um um so part of your duties is oversee
 
06:14:10.190 --> 06:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
payroll yes what what does that entail I
 
06:14:11.910 --> 06:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
mean do you have your own payroll do are
 
06:14:13.590 --> 06:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
do you have your own payroll system
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's unique to the doj or you you
 
06:14:18.430 --> 06:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
leveraging some other broader State
 
06:14:20.350 --> 06:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
system so we use what's called New
 
06:14:25.270 --> 06:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first um it is the state the
 
06:14:27.310 --> 06:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
executive branch uses that it's all
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
their financials it's all Inc compassing
 
06:14:31.708 --> 06:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
it handles your accounts payable your
 
06:14:35.468 --> 06:14:35.478 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable and your payroll
 
06:14:35.478 --> 06:14:36.350 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable and your payroll
um

06:14:36.350 --> 06:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:39.628 --> 06:14:39.638 align:start position:0%
functions so so so are you are you
 
06:14:41.990 --> 06:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
entering the data and then generating
 
06:14:46.190 --> 06:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
the paychecks or is that no so uh we use
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's called workforce management now
 
06:14:50.350 --> 06:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
that just came into effect in November
 
06:14:52.670 --> 06:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
and our
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
um our staff our hourly staff enter they
 
06:15:00.030 --> 06:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
clock in they clock out and then that
 
06:15:03.910 --> 06:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
gets integrated into New Hampshire first
 
06:15:06.230 --> 06:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
and all those fun functions the actual
 
06:15:09.030 --> 06:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
we check everything we double check
 
06:15:12.670 --> 06:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
everything um all of that is handled
 
06:15:21.868 --> 06:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
services so I've kind of run through the
 
06:15:25.670 --> 06:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
overall structure here because I'm a
 
06:15:27.548 --> 06:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I like to go into detail but
 
06:15:30.190 --> 06:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
you know I the rest of a lot of the rest
 
06:15:31.628 --> 06:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
of the PowerPoint just starts to go into
 
06:15:33.190 --> 06:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
more detail of each of the bureaus I
 
06:15:35.110 --> 06:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if not sure I need to talk
 
06:15:36.350 --> 06:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
through that for purpose of today's
 
06:15:38.150 --> 06:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
presentation I can just kind of note
 
06:15:40.548 --> 06:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
what's here and if there are questions
 
06:15:42.270 --> 06:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
the next slide I just break down the
 
06:15:44.270 --> 06:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
various units and various parts of the
 
06:15:46.910 --> 06:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Bureau is this YDC unit
 
06:15:48.868 --> 06:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
new is this for the case or is that
 
06:15:51.590 --> 06:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
something else yeah the the YDC unit is
 
06:15:54.708 --> 06:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
is a is what I would call a temporary
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
unit the reality is that it there's only
 
06:16:00.468 --> 06:16:00.478 align:start position:0%
a couple of employees who are really
 
06:16:03.548 --> 06:16:03.558 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that unit but then we have
 
06:16:05.548 --> 06:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
probably 10 to 12 attorneys
 
06:16:07.590 --> 06:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
across the bureau who are handling YDC
 
06:16:11.150 --> 06:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
cases so we think of it as its own unit
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
because it's just a good way to organize
 
06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
it internally but it hasn't resulted in
 
06:16:18.948 --> 06:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of extra employees it's resulted
 
06:16:20.868 --> 06:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
in spreading work across a lot of
 
06:16:22.830 --> 06:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
existing employees in in the
 
06:16:26.110 --> 06:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
bureau yeah representa cell thank you Mr
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
chair given given the situation of YDC
 
06:16:31.468 --> 06:16:31.478 align:start position:0%
and the way it's headed uh is there any
 
06:16:34.310 --> 06:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
concern or danger that prisoners at the
 
06:16:37.390 --> 06:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
state prison will start making claims
 
06:16:39.070 --> 06:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
that they're they've been abused or
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
molested and they they will have
 
06:16:43.990 --> 06:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuits uh is that happening or can it
 
06:16:47.430 --> 06:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:47.440 --> 06:16:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
happen

06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
we yeah there's a couple different
 
06:16:54.670 --> 06:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
answers to that so I mean we have had
 
06:16:57.628 --> 06:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
cases that allege that um I can't say
 
06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
it's impossible that we'll get you know
 
06:17:04.590 --> 06:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
that a large number of those cases but I
 
06:17:04.600 --> 06:17:06.230 align:start position:0%
that a large number of those cases but I
will

06:17:06.230 --> 06:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
will
 
06:17:10.750 --> 06:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
but I I would not expect to see the same
 
06:17:12.628 --> 06:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
type of
 
06:17:15.150 --> 06:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
situation in the adult from the adult
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
population of our prisons
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
because one of the Dynamics that's at
 
06:17:22.270 --> 06:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
play when you're dealing with kids so
 
06:17:23.750 --> 06:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
kids who were
 
06:17:27.590 --> 06:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated is that for many years I
 
06:17:31.070 --> 06:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
mean before now but decades ago the way
 
06:17:33.390 --> 06:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
we would treat incarcerated kids would
 
06:17:33.400 --> 06:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
we would treat incarcerated kids would
be

06:17:35.190 --> 06:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:17:37.830 --> 06:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
I would say far too similar to adults
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
but they I think kids would have a lot
 
06:17:41.548 --> 06:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
harder time reporting something like
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
that and there's there's a lot more
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
reason to think that those types of
 
06:17:48.230 --> 06:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
cases would go
 
06:17:50.948 --> 06:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
unreported when when you had child
 
06:17:54.510 --> 06:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
victims because kids don't necessarily
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
know that something like that is
 
06:17:57.868 --> 06:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
happening to them if it's happening to
 
06:18:00.030 --> 06:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
them that it's that it's wrong or
 
06:18:02.628 --> 06:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
illegal I mean they that it's obviously
 
06:18:05.350 --> 06:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
not it's a traumatizing experience
 
06:18:06.548 --> 06:18:06.558 align:start position:0%
but if you're an
 
06:18:09.150 --> 06:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated youth you're not
 
06:18:10.468 --> 06:18:10.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to think to report
 
06:18:12.910 --> 06:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
something like that adults are doing it
 
06:18:15.070 --> 06:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
adults in
 
06:18:17.310 --> 06:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
this government facility that you've
 
06:18:19.468 --> 06:18:19.478 align:start position:0%
been put into are doing it so you would
 
06:18:22.788 --> 06:18:22.798 align:start position:0%
have reasons to to not report I don't
 
06:18:26.430 --> 06:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
expect that we would see nearly the same
 
06:18:28.868 --> 06:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
volume of unreported cases in an adult
 
06:18:28.878 --> 06:18:30.390 align:start position:0%
volume of unreported cases in an adult
incarcerated

06:18:30.390 --> 06:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
06:18:32.350 --> 06:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
population that doesn't mean we may not
 
06:18:34.468 --> 06:18:34.478 align:start position:0%
see allegations but I would I would look
 
06:18:36.310 --> 06:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
on those types of allegations with a lot
 
06:18:38.670 --> 06:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
more skepticism than I would look on the
 
06:18:40.868 --> 06:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
allegations we've seen from YDC follow
 
06:18:43.350 --> 06:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
up follow up thank you um and thank you
 
06:18:46.270 --> 06:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
for the answer um are there currently to
 
06:18:48.830 --> 06:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
the to the best of your knowledge any
 
06:18:51.670 --> 06:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
people that are in prison that were in
 
06:18:55.030 --> 06:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
YDC and they're filing lawsuits right
 
06:18:59.150 --> 06:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
now yes many of the YDC the plaintiffs
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
in the YDC cases are individuals who are
 
06:19:04.390 --> 06:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
currently incarcerated I don't have the
 
06:19:07.708 --> 06:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
exact number but there there we do have
 
06:19:09.830 --> 06:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
the we do have a fair amount that would
 
06:19:11.468 --> 06:19:11.478 align:start position:0%
be a good number to know for us thank
 
06:19:13.830 --> 06:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
you okay representative mens then
 
06:19:16.190 --> 06:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative W thank you and thank you
 
06:19:19.150 --> 06:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question um last
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
week the Chief Justice was with us and
 
06:19:25.150 --> 06:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
he was saying um you know I'm not going
 
06:19:27.350 --> 06:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
to quote him exactly but that basically
 
06:19:30.548 --> 06:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
the impact of YDC is having a um an
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
impact on the ability of the state to
 
06:19:35.628 --> 06:19:35.638 align:start position:0%
administer Justice more broadly um and
 
06:19:38.230 --> 06:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
the clear message that I took away was
 
06:19:40.750 --> 06:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
that the the YDC cases are putting an
 
06:19:42.270 --> 06:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of stress on the
 
06:19:45.190 --> 06:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch are you feeling that
 
06:19:47.468 --> 06:19:47.478 align:start position:0%
stress as well in term you know as the
 
06:19:49.990 --> 06:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
as the The Entity that has to litigate
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
these things and is that going to mean
 
06:19:53.670 --> 06:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
is that going to require you to need
 
06:19:56.750 --> 06:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
additional resources going
 
06:20:00.270 --> 06:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
forward yeah it's look the YDC cases
 
06:20:02.510 --> 06:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
collectively are certainly a lot of work
 
06:20:05.270 --> 06:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
there there are three components of it
 
06:20:07.628 --> 06:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
right now one is the civil litigation so
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
so the civil lawsuits one is the the YDC
 
06:20:13.628 --> 06:20:13.638 align:start position:0%
settlement fund and one component are
 
06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
are the criminal cases and I think it is
 
06:20:18.110 --> 06:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
putting a large burden certainly on the
 
06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and and the
 
06:20:24.868 --> 06:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
defense bar um I would tend to submit
 
06:20:26.830 --> 06:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
that I think the burden is far greater
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
on those litigating the cases than than
 
06:20:31.030 --> 06:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
Jud than the judicial branch not to say
 
06:20:32.430 --> 06:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
there isn't a burden on the judicial
 
06:20:35.590 --> 06:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
branch but I I think think it's a much
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
bigger workload on on those who are
 
06:20:43.468 --> 06:20:43.478 align:start position:0%
litigating the the cases um and we are
 
06:20:45.670 --> 06:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
going to need to continue to have
 
06:20:48.510 --> 06:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
resources to do that I think we have
 
06:20:50.788 --> 06:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
done a pretty good job resourcing up to
 
06:20:52.948 --> 06:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
handle it though so I don't think we're
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
going to need to see an increase in
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
resources from what we have today but I
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
think if the civil litigation were to
 
06:21:02.868 --> 06:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
continue it's been costing us probably
 
06:21:05.468 --> 06:21:05.478 align:start position:0%
$3 to5 million a year to litigate the
 
06:21:05.478 --> 06:21:06.430 align:start position:0%
$3 to5 million a year to litigate the
civil

06:21:06.430 --> 06:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
civil
 
06:21:09.350 --> 06:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
cases and it
 
06:21:12.910 --> 06:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
is cost us you know
 
06:21:15.948 --> 06:21:15.958 align:start position:0%
probably $1 to2 million a year to
 
06:21:17.788 --> 06:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
prosecute the criminal CA to investigate
 
06:21:20.350 --> 06:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
and prosecute the criminal cases and
 
06:21:23.030 --> 06:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
then the settlement fund the
 
06:21:25.150 --> 06:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses per year for the
 
06:21:27.868 --> 06:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office have probably
 
06:21:31.110 --> 06:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
been somewhere between $1 and $3 million
 
06:21:33.788 --> 06:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
a year so I don't expect that to go up
 
06:21:35.830 --> 06:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
from here I guess that's to the extent
 
06:21:37.310 --> 06:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
um positive news on the resource front I
 
06:21:42.070 --> 06:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't expect that resource burden to go
 
06:21:44.070 --> 06:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
up I actually expect that it would
 
06:21:46.670 --> 06:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
continue to gradually
 
06:21:49.150 --> 06:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
decline as these cases continue to
 
06:21:53.590 --> 06:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
proceed because we the longer we do them
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
the more efficiencies we develop the
 
06:21:58.670 --> 06:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
more familiar we are with the entire
 
06:22:01.948 --> 06:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
universe of of the cases but but I think
 
06:22:04.868 --> 06:22:04.878 align:start position:0%
that we we have been able to Resource up
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
to handle handle the workload but it is
 
06:22:11.230 --> 06:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
it is a very big um resource
 
06:22:14.830 --> 06:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
commitment but I think we have peaked at
 
06:22:16.510 --> 06:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the resource commitment
 
06:22:19.590 --> 06:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
of handling the cases right not
 
06:22:21.070 --> 06:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily and I know we're going to
 
06:22:22.270 --> 06:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
talk you're going to want to talk about
 
06:22:25.110 --> 06:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
this in the payouts from a from a
 
06:22:26.390 --> 06:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
settlement fund but certainly in the
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
resource commitment to handle the cases
 
06:22:31.030 --> 06:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
I think I think we have peaked but it
 
06:22:34.590 --> 06:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
it's a big resource burden for the
 
06:22:37.150 --> 06:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system for the Civil
 
06:22:38.910 --> 06:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
litigators you know for the
 
06:22:39.830 --> 06:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
administrative function of the
 
06:22:41.110 --> 06:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
settlement funds certainly for the
 
06:22:43.468 --> 06:22:43.478 align:start position:0%
judicial branch absolutely it's a big
 
06:22:45.788 --> 06:22:45.798 align:start position:0%
resource burden across across the
 
06:22:48.390 --> 06:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
Spectrum but we are continuing to handle
 
06:22:50.310 --> 06:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
our other cases too and I expect that we
 
06:22:52.150 --> 06:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
will continue to be able to do that and
 
06:22:54.670 --> 06:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
to do it well representative
 
06:22:57.110 --> 06:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
W thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:22:59.788 --> 06:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
General Fela this has been a real budget
 
06:23:02.230 --> 06:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
Buster this YDC when you originally came
 
06:23:05.190 --> 06:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
to us you said 100 million we gas
 
06:23:06.750 --> 06:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
and you had done some research to come
 
06:23:08.350 --> 06:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
up with that figure this last thing we
 
06:23:10.910 --> 06:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
heard a few months ago was 500 million
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
course we've limited it to 75 million a
 
06:23:15.830 --> 06:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
year and so it's going to stretch out
 
06:23:18.628 --> 06:23:18.638 align:start position:0%
forever but some of the people are
 
06:23:20.270 --> 06:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
saying the reason there's so many is
 
06:23:22.430 --> 06:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
these lawyers are out advertising and
 
06:23:24.110 --> 06:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
encouraging people and some of them are
 
06:23:26.548 --> 06:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
making up stories and that has to be all
 
06:23:29.590 --> 06:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
sorted out and what we we could set a
 
06:23:31.070 --> 06:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
limit but we would appreciate if you
 
06:23:34.070 --> 06:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
would set a limit lower than 33 and A3
 
06:23:36.230 --> 06:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever ever it was per case per
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer because if he's got a 100
 
06:23:42.230 --> 06:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
clients he's certainly not going to put
 
06:23:44.670 --> 06:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
in the same effort after the first five
 
06:23:46.830 --> 06:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
or six as he's going to do for the rest
 
06:23:49.628 --> 06:23:49.638 align:start position:0%
so you should have kind of declining
 
06:23:51.510 --> 06:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
percentage that the lawyer getting
 
06:23:53.230 --> 06:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're they'll thinking this
 
06:23:55.910 --> 06:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
is the getrich quick scheme oh I can
 
06:23:57.708 --> 06:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
advertise I get all these people to get
 
06:24:00.310 --> 06:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
up and and whatever they get I get a
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
third and it it's it's really disturbing
 
06:24:05.990 --> 06:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to me that you know this is plus this is
 
06:24:07.190 --> 06:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
06:24:07.200 --> 06:24:08.830 align:start position:0%
kind of a
trauma

06:24:08.830 --> 06:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
06:24:12.150 --> 06:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
situation and it seems like in other
 
06:24:15.150 --> 06:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
cases like this where trauma is a is a
 
06:24:17.948 --> 06:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
big part of it that not only should
 
06:24:17.958 --> 06:24:18.868 align:start position:0%
big part of it that not only should
there

06:24:18.868 --> 06:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:24:22.310 --> 06:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
be a cash award but there should be a
 
06:24:24.910 --> 06:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
compulsory counseling psychiatric
 
06:24:27.070 --> 06:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
counseling and if if you refuse to take
 
06:24:29.468 --> 06:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
the counseling you don't get the money
 
06:24:31.510 --> 06:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help you if the whole
 
06:24:33.030 --> 06:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to help the people
 
06:24:35.430 --> 06:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
that have been wronged then a big part
 
06:24:38.430 --> 06:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
of it would be psychiatric counseling
 
06:24:40.910 --> 06:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
and set some number of hours to it and
 
06:24:42.510 --> 06:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
no I don't want it I just want the money
 
06:24:44.590 --> 06:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
then you don't get the money you have to
 
06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
go submit to the psychiatric counseling
 
06:24:48.548 --> 06:24:48.558 align:start position:0%
if we're really in the business
 
06:24:51.910 --> 06:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
of helping people that have been wronged
 
06:24:53.708 --> 06:24:53.718 align:start position:0%
that's a big part of it because a lot of
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
this is in their mind and it has SL you
 
06:24:59.070 --> 06:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
know obviously that it's made a mess of
 
06:25:01.468 --> 06:25:01.478 align:start position:0%
their minds with what's happened to them
 
06:25:03.910 --> 06:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm surprised that none of
 
06:25:05.830 --> 06:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
the other cases that went across the
 
06:25:08.030 --> 06:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
country like this have included
 
06:25:10.910 --> 06:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
compulsory counseling and I think it
 
06:25:13.510 --> 06:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be in I would suggest those things
 
06:25:16.270 --> 06:25:16.280 align:start position:0%
plus reducing the percentage the lawyer
 
06:25:19.510 --> 06:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
gets would mean fewer cases especially
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
when they're out soliciting for all of
 
06:25:24.548 --> 06:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
them but that's my thought that when I
 
06:25:26.390 --> 06:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
thought about all this in the way it was
 
06:25:29.868 --> 06:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
described as trauma inforced and so on
 
06:25:33.150 --> 06:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
that that's the way you help people you
 
06:25:35.510 --> 06:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
have some psychi counseling to try to
 
06:25:37.628 --> 06:25:37.638 align:start position:0%
get them to you know realize what's
 
06:25:40.590 --> 06:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
happened and and how to adjust to it and
 
06:25:41.830 --> 06:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know some of them have done it on
 
06:25:44.030 --> 06:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
their own but obviously the rest have
 
06:25:47.030 --> 06:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
not so I would hope you would bring some
 
06:25:49.708 --> 06:25:49.718 align:start position:0%
of that into the the whole mix and see
 
06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
what the the effect would be plus reduce
 
06:25:54.868 --> 06:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
the amount that's going to somebody with
 
06:25:57.750 --> 06:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
multiple cases 33 and a third in every
 
06:25:59.788 --> 06:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
case after a while it's cookie cutter
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
yeah that's similar to to a question I
 
06:26:04.750 --> 06:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
asked you right about that uh
 
06:26:06.750 --> 06:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees aspect can you want to
 
06:26:09.468 --> 06:26:09.478 align:start position:0%
talk about that sure no I app I
 
06:26:11.190 --> 06:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question representative I
 
06:26:12.868 --> 06:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
did just want to say one thing just to
 
06:26:15.190 --> 06:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
make it clear for for the record I know
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion about
 
06:26:18.510 --> 06:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
the you know we've had a lot of
 
06:26:20.670 --> 06:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about those YDC settman fund
 
06:26:22.190 --> 06:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
over the last few
 
06:26:25.788 --> 06:26:25.798 align:start position:0%
years I've always maintained that that
 
06:26:27.628 --> 06:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
it is very hard to know what the total
 
06:26:29.110 --> 06:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
amount is going to be and we have to
 
06:26:31.310 --> 06:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
continue to sort of evaluate that as as
 
06:26:33.708 --> 06:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
we go right we started with 100 million
 
06:26:36.310 --> 06:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we didn't know how many
 
06:26:38.830 --> 06:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
claims we're going to get and we also
 
06:26:41.910 --> 06:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what to think of the claims
 
06:26:44.548 --> 06:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
until we get them and so I think we have
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
to I think the approach we we've always
 
06:26:48.468 --> 06:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
had to take with this we need to
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
continue to take is we just have to
 
06:26:52.230 --> 06:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
06:26:55.270 --> 06:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate as we continue to get more
 
06:26:57.310 --> 06:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
information right and as we continue to
 
06:26:58.310 --> 06:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
see these
 
06:27:01.310 --> 06:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
claims and we don't want to think about
 
06:27:04.750 --> 06:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
these claims as a you know 1,400 15
 
06:27:08.310 --> 06:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
00 monolith 1400 1500 claim monolith
 
06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
every claim is different all these
 
06:27:12.430 --> 06:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
claims are individual claims and you
 
06:27:15.788 --> 06:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
know we we've resolved 250 of them we're
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
going to continue to review the claims
 
06:27:21.430 --> 06:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
as they come and claims will continue to
 
06:27:23.910 --> 06:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
be resolved but we're also going to
 
06:27:26.468 --> 06:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
continue to re-evaluate as we see the
 
06:27:30.310 --> 06:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
claims come through and we will continue
 
06:27:31.990 --> 06:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
to provide information of course to the
 
06:27:33.670 --> 06:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to to the governor to
 
06:27:35.350 --> 06:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
everyone in involved as we see these
 
06:27:37.670 --> 06:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
claims coming through and decisions will
 
06:27:39.670 --> 06:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
need to be made based on the information
 
06:27:42.390 --> 06:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we continue to receive so I think
 
06:27:44.110 --> 06:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
you know I said it a few years ago it
 
06:27:45.590 --> 06:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
would would be hard to know the total I
 
06:27:47.110 --> 06:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
would say that today we know what we've
 
06:27:49.390 --> 06:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
spent to date it's very hard to estimate
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
what we might spend long term as for
 
06:27:52.320 --> 06:27:54.788 align:start position:0%
what we might spend long term as for
attorney's

06:27:54.788 --> 06:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
attorney's
 
06:27:57.230 --> 06:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
fees I agree that it's something that
 
06:28:00.070 --> 06:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
needs to continue to be SC scrutinized
 
06:28:02.230 --> 06:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
right we had this conversation when we
 
06:28:04.270 --> 06:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
were first looking at the legislation
 
06:28:05.548 --> 06:28:05.558 align:start position:0%
back in
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
2022 whether to set a you know an amount
 
06:28:14.350 --> 06:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
that or I should say where to set the
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
maximum amount and the 33 and a half% at
 
06:28:19.548 --> 06:28:19.558 align:start position:0%
the end of the day is a maximum that
 
06:28:22.110 --> 06:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
does that is never me was never meant to
 
06:28:24.990 --> 06:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
say that every case that's what the
 
06:28:27.628 --> 06:28:27.638 align:start position:0%
attorney fee should be right and we
 
06:28:29.190 --> 06:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
talked about who would make that
 
06:28:31.628 --> 06:28:31.638 align:start position:0%
decision and
 
06:28:33.670 --> 06:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately the decision was made to
 
06:28:35.390 --> 06:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
leave that to the to the discretion of
 
06:28:37.670 --> 06:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
the administrator but like I say with
 
06:28:39.750 --> 06:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
this entire process the plaintiffs have
 
06:28:41.230 --> 06:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
always said they'll continue to
 
06:28:43.390 --> 06:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
reevaluate how they think it's going we
 
06:28:45.430 --> 06:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
need to re continue to reevaluate how we
 
06:28:46.910 --> 06:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
think it's going
 
06:28:50.510 --> 06:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
and always continue to to look at every
 
06:28:53.510 --> 06:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
part of it and I think you know it's a
 
06:28:54.750 --> 06:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
question that needs to be asked to the
 
06:28:57.548 --> 06:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
administrator if too often 33 and a
 
06:29:00.390 --> 06:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
half% is being given and it's a question
 
06:29:01.868 --> 06:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
that would have to be asked of us if in
 
06:29:03.590 --> 06:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
the claims we resolve are we always
 
06:29:07.030 --> 06:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
agreeing 33 and a half% and I completely
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
agree that the longer you go the harder
 
06:29:13.868 --> 06:29:13.878 align:start position:0%
it is to justify a high attorney fee
 
06:29:16.230 --> 06:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
because there might be a lot of work you
 
06:29:18.910 --> 06:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
put in in the earlier claims because
 
06:29:21.948 --> 06:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
it's all new and and you haven't gone
 
06:29:25.788 --> 06:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
through it before the more claims you do
 
06:29:26.990 --> 06:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's safe to say probably the
 
06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
less work you're putting into each claim
 
06:29:30.270 --> 06:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
and so it's just another piece of this
 
06:29:31.990 --> 06:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have to continue to re-evaluate but I
 
06:29:34.750 --> 06:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
would I would agree that that that that
 
06:29:36.230 --> 06:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
is something that needs to continue to
 
06:29:37.910 --> 06:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
be scrutinized and something we need to
 
06:29:40.150 --> 06:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
keep a close eye on because the goal of
 
06:29:40.160 --> 06:29:41.150 align:start position:0%
keep a close eye on because the goal of
this

06:29:41.150 --> 06:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:29:44.430 --> 06:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
fund is to compensate those who have
 
06:29:47.590 --> 06:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
suffered harm right not to pay lawyers
 
06:29:51.868 --> 06:29:51.878 align:start position:0%
or or or send money to other places
 
06:29:53.910 --> 06:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative followup I think it's
 
06:29:56.430 --> 06:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's progress that because of the way
 
06:29:58.868 --> 06:29:58.878 align:start position:0%
we're limited it to 75 million a year
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
there won't be as many huge payoffs that
 
06:30:04.590 --> 06:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
people go out and just wait
 
06:30:06.628 --> 06:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
they're not going to use it to to help
 
06:30:08.750 --> 06:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
themselves which is what it's supposed
 
06:30:12.510 --> 06:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
to do they're just going to go below it
 
06:30:14.788 --> 06:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
and uh you know and and they'll have
 
06:30:16.390 --> 06:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
their friends lined up to grab a piece
 
06:30:18.390 --> 06:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
and all this kind of thing so having a
 
06:30:21.350 --> 06:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
little counseling might tell them okay
 
06:30:24.150 --> 06:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
this money is supposed to make you heal
 
06:30:25.590 --> 06:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
first we're going to have compulsory
 
06:30:27.030 --> 06:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
counseling then you're going to have
 
06:30:29.708 --> 06:30:29.718 align:start position:0%
some more guidance on what you do what
 
06:30:32.468 --> 06:30:32.478 align:start position:0%
you missed out on by going through all
 
06:30:35.628 --> 06:30:35.638 align:start position:0%
this and and now we want to F give you
 
06:30:37.990 --> 06:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
some guidance on how you can mend your
 
06:30:42.230 --> 06:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
life instead of just woo going to Vegas
 
06:30:43.548 --> 06:30:43.558 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things the
 
06:30:46.030 --> 06:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
administrator's office has done is tried
 
06:30:48.310 --> 06:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
to do what they can to connect people
 
06:30:50.628 --> 06:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
with those types of resources so that
 
06:30:52.070 --> 06:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's a function that I think
 
06:30:53.708 --> 06:30:53.718 align:start position:0%
the administrator's office is well
 
06:30:55.868 --> 06:30:55.878 align:start position:0%
positioned to play because they're seen
 
06:30:57.590 --> 06:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
as the neutrals in this you know the
 
06:30:58.948 --> 06:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office we have to
 
06:31:01.230 --> 06:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
litigate on behalf of the state so I
 
06:31:03.110 --> 06:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
think a victim or a plaintiff is not
 
06:31:04.468 --> 06:31:04.478 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be coming to us to
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
ask about those resources but we've
 
06:31:07.910 --> 06:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
we've had those discussions with the
 
06:31:09.788 --> 06:31:09.798 align:start position:0%
administrator and they're trying to do
 
06:31:12.868 --> 06:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
what they can to connect victims with
 
06:31:15.628 --> 06:31:15.638 align:start position:0%
those types of resources like counseling
 
06:31:17.350 --> 06:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
all right representative eil followed by
 
06:31:21.150 --> 06:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
representative cell okay just uh quickly
 
06:31:23.788 --> 06:31:23.798 align:start position:0%
so just based on the numbers that you
 
06:31:26.270 --> 06:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
gave you said three to five million a
 
06:31:30.750 --> 06:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
year for criminal for YDC sorry 1 to2
 
06:31:33.190 --> 06:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
million for civil and 1 to three million
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
a year for administration of the claims
 
06:31:37.750 --> 06:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
so I was just trying to estimate so it's
 
06:31:43.430 --> 06:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
like5 to10 million a year that um is
 
06:31:45.628 --> 06:31:45.638 align:start position:0%
being used through the Department of
 
06:31:48.708 --> 06:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
Justice to handle the YDC
 
06:31:50.990 --> 06:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
claims yeah I think it was I think it
 
06:31:53.510 --> 06:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
was 3 to five million for civil civil I
 
06:31:56.708 --> 06:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
got it flipped yeah okay one to two for
 
06:31:59.430 --> 06:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
criminal okay I got it flipped and then
 
06:32:02.230 --> 06:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
one to three for the settlement fund but
 
06:32:04.310 --> 06:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
the toal I think the total comes out
 
06:32:06.990 --> 06:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
five to 10 okay yes so that you add it
 
06:32:08.910 --> 06:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
all up so that was one thing so the
 
06:32:10.670 --> 06:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
other thing we talked about with the
 
06:32:13.910 --> 06:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
judicial branch is is the fact it
 
06:32:16.270 --> 06:32:16.280 align:start position:0%
sounded like everyone is filing claims
 
06:32:19.070 --> 06:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
through the superior court but they also
 
06:32:23.990 --> 06:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
can file claims through the claims
 
06:32:27.110 --> 06:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
process so the idea is that if you if
 
06:32:28.830 --> 06:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
you mediate and settle through the
 
06:32:31.868 --> 06:32:31.878 align:start position:0%
claims process that cuts off your Venue
 
06:32:34.830 --> 06:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
to the Superior Court correct is that
 
06:32:37.430 --> 06:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes right and conversely if you get a
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
settlement through the Superior Court
 
06:32:42.350 --> 06:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
you can't go back to the claims I think
 
06:32:45.070 --> 06:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
for some of us it was a little we didn't
 
06:32:47.548 --> 06:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
realize you could file in both places
 
06:32:50.868 --> 06:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
yes you can file in both places if you
 
06:32:53.150 --> 06:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
if you have filed a lawsuit in Superior
 
06:32:56.388 --> 06:32:56.398 align:start position:0%
Court and you file then you then file a
 
06:32:58.468 --> 06:32:58.478 align:start position:0%
claim in the claims fund you're required
 
06:33:01.350 --> 06:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
to stay your Superior Court litigation
 
06:33:03.868 --> 06:33:03.878 align:start position:0%
while you're in the claims fund so there
 
06:33:06.990 --> 06:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
may be a lawsuit sitting there in
 
06:33:09.070 --> 06:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and you may also be in
 
06:33:11.070 --> 06:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
the claims fund you're not allowed to
 
06:33:14.150 --> 06:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
move the two forward at the same time I
 
06:33:15.310 --> 06:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
think what the court and I don't want to
 
06:33:17.310 --> 06:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
speak for the courts because I I'm I'm
 
06:33:20.070 --> 06:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
not I I'm not part of the the judicial
 
06:33:22.230 --> 06:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
branch and I don't you know have to deal
 
06:33:25.270 --> 06:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
with with their their administrative
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
functions but there are a lot of
 
06:33:30.430 --> 06:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
administrative uh tasks there's a lot of
 
06:33:32.670 --> 06:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
administrative work that comes with just
 
06:33:35.430 --> 06:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
managing that many cases you know you
 
06:33:37.548 --> 06:33:37.558 align:start position:0%
when you file a simple pleading if
 
06:33:40.190 --> 06:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
you're filing it in a docket that's got
 
06:33:43.150 --> 06:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
a bunch of individual cases you got to
 
06:33:44.910 --> 06:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
file that same thing over and over again
 
06:33:47.230 --> 06:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
you know so organizing it certainly
 
06:33:49.030 --> 06:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of work there's a lot of
 
06:33:51.830 --> 06:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
work and resource burden that that comes
 
06:33:53.910 --> 06:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
with that because of the sheer number of
 
06:33:56.350 --> 06:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
cases but the cases are not going to be
 
06:33:59.150 --> 06:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
able to move forward at the same time so
 
06:34:00.750 --> 06:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be having say a
 
06:34:03.868 --> 06:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding in the settlement
 
06:34:07.230 --> 06:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
fund and then a trial in your civil case
 
06:34:09.750 --> 06:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
shortly after that's just it's not going
 
06:34:11.468 --> 06:34:11.478 align:start position:0%
to happen that way because if you're in
 
06:34:13.230 --> 06:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
the claims fund your civil case has to
 
06:34:15.830 --> 06:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
pause do do you do you have a sense of
 
06:34:17.548 --> 06:34:17.558 align:start position:0%
how many claims have been filed through
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
the claims process it is approaching 900
 
06:34:25.110 --> 06:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's getting close to 900 so a lot of
 
06:34:27.948 --> 06:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
claims are coming into the claims fund
 
06:34:32.388 --> 06:34:32.398 align:start position:0%
at this process at this point I think uh
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 14 and
 
06:34:35.670 --> 06:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
1400 and
 
06:34:38.230 --> 06:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
1500 civil cases in superior court have
 
06:34:41.190 --> 06:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
been filed it was 1363 or something
 
06:34:44.910 --> 06:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative C thank you Mr chair so I
 
06:34:47.030 --> 06:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
understand fully that we cannot put a
 
06:34:49.910 --> 06:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
number a figure on the number of dollars
 
06:34:51.868 --> 06:34:51.878 align:start position:0%
that this is going to cost ultimately
 
06:34:53.830 --> 06:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
but I asked this question two years ago
 
06:34:55.948 --> 06:34:55.958 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering we should be able to put
 
06:34:58.190 --> 06:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
bounds around what are the potential
 
06:35:01.030 --> 06:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
number of people that are going to file
 
06:35:03.708 --> 06:35:03.718 align:start position:0%
and that that number would be anybody
 
06:35:05.830 --> 06:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
that ever went to the through the YDC
 
06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
system so at this stage of the game do
 
06:35:09.830 --> 06:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
we know what that number is you know
 
06:35:12.230 --> 06:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
we've been at it now for a few years I
 
06:35:13.388 --> 06:35:13.398 align:start position:0%
would expect that we would have the
 
06:35:15.750 --> 06:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
records to know how many people went
 
06:35:17.750 --> 06:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
through there so what that would be your
 
06:35:21.430 --> 06:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
ultimate number of potential lawsuits do
 
06:35:25.070 --> 06:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:28.388 --> 06:35:28.398 align:start position:0%
number I'm I'm sure we could we could
 
06:35:30.030 --> 06:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
get that number right I don't have that
 
06:35:32.910 --> 06:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
number here but but the total number of
 
06:35:35.590 --> 06:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who have gone through YDC
 
06:35:38.190 --> 06:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
you know in a within a certain time
 
06:35:39.548 --> 06:35:39.558 align:start position:0%
window we could certainly get that
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
number yes well that would be important
 
06:35:43.948 --> 06:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
because at least that would give us one
 
06:35:46.670 --> 06:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
bound that we could work with and say
 
06:35:49.788 --> 06:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
okay well at least now we know this is
 
06:35:52.670 --> 06:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
the the most damage that can be done Y
 
06:35:54.150 --> 06:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then we can work backwards from
 
06:35:56.910 --> 06:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
there to to then longterm figure out
 
06:36:00.070 --> 06:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
what it might cost us financially yep so
 
06:36:02.070 --> 06:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
because again if not this is totally
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
open-ended and it's you know I'll be
 
06:36:07.030 --> 06:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
running you know 20 years from now the
 
06:36:08.948 --> 06:36:08.958 align:start position:0%
for the seat and we'll still be dealing
 
06:36:10.708 --> 06:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
with the same issue you know and I'll be
 
06:36:12.750 --> 06:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
asking the same question so
 
06:36:16.150 --> 06:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative R thank you Mr chair so
 
06:36:20.270 --> 06:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
still on the YDC uh claims so the the
 
06:36:23.468 --> 06:36:23.478 align:start position:0%
the lawyer fees so let me get let me
 
06:36:26.910 --> 06:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
back up so let's say this the the state
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
says okay we've accepted your claim we
 
06:36:32.190 --> 06:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
are going to settle it does the lawyer
 
06:36:35.430 --> 06:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
fee come off that amount amount or is
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the lawyer fee paid in addition to that
 
06:36:42.030 --> 06:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
amount my thought is that I mean if we
 
06:36:44.430 --> 06:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
leave the free the fee up to the free
 
06:36:46.468 --> 06:36:46.478 align:start position:0%
market there may be attorneys that say
 
06:36:50.190 --> 06:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
I'll take your case for 20% or
 
06:36:53.270 --> 06:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
15% yeah and and we do leave the fee I
 
06:36:54.830 --> 06:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
would say up to the market because the
 
06:36:57.030 --> 06:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
33 and a half% is just a maximum
 
06:37:00.510 --> 06:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
somebody can get okay it it's and so
 
06:37:02.468 --> 06:37:02.478 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that stops the attorney
 
06:37:04.750 --> 06:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
from making a deal with their client say
 
06:37:07.430 --> 06:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
when they first enter the fund
 
06:37:11.070 --> 06:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to get 20% right of
 
06:37:12.830 --> 06:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
whatever is recovered through this
 
06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
settlement fund process there's nothing
 
06:37:16.948 --> 06:37:16.958 align:start position:0%
that stops them from from doing that the
 
06:37:19.388 --> 06:37:19.398 align:start position:0%
33 and a half% is just a cap but it
 
06:37:22.990 --> 06:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
comes out of what the award is so if a
 
06:37:25.590 --> 06:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
claimant comes through and gets
 
06:37:28.030 --> 06:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and they've agreed and there's
 
06:37:31.150 --> 06:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
a either the administrator Awards 20% in
 
06:37:34.110 --> 06:37:34.120 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees or they've read there's
 
06:37:36.350 --> 06:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a 20% attorney fee that
 
06:37:38.270 --> 06:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
comes out of the 500,000 so the state
 
06:37:40.270 --> 06:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay more than
 
06:37:42.708 --> 06:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
$500,000 in that instance the claim it
 
06:37:44.990 --> 06:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
would get 400,000 the attorney would get
 
06:37:48.670 --> 06:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
100,000 okay follow Mr chair and
 
06:37:50.510 --> 06:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
following up on representative wier's
 
06:37:51.948 --> 06:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
question has there ever been a
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
settlement that the state H is aware of
 
06:37:57.948 --> 06:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
where part of that would be for the
 
06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
victim to get counseling or therapy I
 
06:38:02.868 --> 06:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
mean even if someone was physically
 
06:38:06.670 --> 06:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
injured and sued the state um has the
 
06:38:08.868 --> 06:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
state made it the the settlement
 
06:38:11.388 --> 06:38:11.398 align:start position:0%
contingent on whether they get physical
 
06:38:13.230 --> 06:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
therapy for instance or occupational
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
therapy for their
 
06:38:18.468 --> 06:38:18.478 align:start position:0%
injury I am not aware of of that type of
 
06:38:20.830 --> 06:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
settlement especially in a in a case in
 
06:38:24.070 --> 06:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
a in cases like this okay thank you no
 
06:38:24.080 --> 06:38:25.350 align:start position:0%
a in cases like this okay thank you no
representa

06:38:25.350 --> 06:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
representa
 
06:38:28.510 --> 06:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
Ms um if we're if we're done with YDC
 
06:38:29.830 --> 06:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
for a minute I'd like to go into a
 
06:38:32.030 --> 06:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
different direction oh all right well
 
06:38:34.070 --> 06:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
well let's wait wait for for a moment on
 
06:38:36.070 --> 06:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
um so when we first SP when we spoke
 
06:38:42.270 --> 06:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
about this two years ago you told us
 
06:38:44.708 --> 06:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
that um there's something called
 
06:38:47.948 --> 06:38:47.958 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity which lets us decide
 
06:38:51.270 --> 06:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what turn under what terms and
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
the state can be sued yep um so we still
 
06:38:57.628 --> 06:38:57.638 align:start position:0%
think that is that yes that's absolutely
 
06:38:59.110 --> 06:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
the case
 
06:39:03.868 --> 06:39:03.878 align:start position:0%
and and are we have we by setting up the
 
06:39:05.708 --> 06:39:05.718 align:start position:0%
the the settlement system the way we
 
06:39:05.718 --> 06:39:06.670 align:start position:0%
the the settlement system the way we
have

06:39:06.670 --> 06:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:39:06.680 --> 06:39:08.190 align:start position:0%
have
already

06:39:08.190 --> 06:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:39:12.270 --> 06:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
um sort of put us in in a contract kind
 
06:39:15.510 --> 06:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
of situation where those terms are no
 
06:39:18.750 --> 06:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
longer changeable no I don't believe
 
06:39:20.830 --> 06:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
that to be the case I I don't think the
 
06:39:22.750 --> 06:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
state is locked into
 
06:39:26.030 --> 06:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
any any terms of this of the settlement
 
06:39:30.110 --> 06:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
fund for anyone who hasn't received an
 
06:39:32.270 --> 06:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
award right so if they're already paid
 
06:39:34.350 --> 06:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
they're already paid right so right or
 
06:39:36.868 --> 06:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
if an award has already been made oh I
 
06:39:38.388 --> 06:39:38.398 align:start position:0%
see and and we're paying on the
 
06:39:40.990 --> 06:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
installment plan correct right like if
 
06:39:43.468 --> 06:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
the legislature has authorized an award
 
06:39:45.388 --> 06:39:45.398 align:start position:0%
to be made and it gets made before the
 
06:39:45.398 --> 06:39:47.070 align:start position:0%
to be made and it gets made before the
legislature

06:39:47.070 --> 06:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:39:49.430 --> 06:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
changes the way the fund works I think
 
06:39:51.430 --> 06:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're locked into that but the
 
06:39:54.150 --> 06:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
legislature retains the ability to to
 
06:39:56.548 --> 06:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
make changes absolutely and would it be
 
06:39:59.190 --> 06:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
in any way improper for this committee
 
06:40:02.350 --> 06:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
to talk to the people running the
 
06:40:03.868 --> 06:40:03.878 align:start position:0%
settlement fund
 
06:40:07.190 --> 06:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the same way we're talking to you I
 
06:40:10.110 --> 06:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
don't think it's improper to to do that
 
06:40:13.110 --> 06:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
no to talk about these kind of details
 
06:40:15.150 --> 06:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
and yeah I don't think it would be
 
06:40:17.070 --> 06:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
improper I I think the one thing you'd
 
06:40:19.270 --> 06:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
want to avoid and I just say this is the
 
06:40:20.990 --> 06:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer for the state and in many
 
06:40:22.750 --> 06:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
contexts sometimes a lawyer for
 
06:40:25.788 --> 06:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
legislators is that I wouldn't ask the
 
06:40:27.990 --> 06:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
administrator about specific cases and
 
06:40:30.750 --> 06:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
how he has decided a particular case but
 
06:40:32.750 --> 06:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think it's perfectly fair to ask the
 
06:40:35.868 --> 06:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
administr about how overall the fund is
 
06:40:39.110 --> 06:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
being administered I think that's that's
 
06:40:41.628 --> 06:40:41.638 align:start position:0%
perfectly Fair topic of conversation and
 
06:40:43.548 --> 06:40:43.558 align:start position:0%
you can always ask the questions and I
 
06:40:46.510 --> 06:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
think the administrator will know how to
 
06:40:49.350 --> 06:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
defer if he thinks he shouldn't comment
 
06:40:51.788 --> 06:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
because he's an experienced attorney
 
06:40:53.190 --> 06:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
experienced attorney and a former Chief
 
06:40:54.948 --> 06:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court so he knows
 
06:40:56.468 --> 06:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
how to not answer the questions he
 
06:40:58.788 --> 06:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
thinks he shouldn't answer all right and
 
06:41:03.750 --> 06:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
one last thing you said that um
 
06:41:06.230 --> 06:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
the the victim and his attorney can
 
06:41:10.110 --> 06:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
agree to various terms so can they agree
 
06:41:12.910 --> 06:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
in the other direction to say I'll give
 
06:41:19.150 --> 06:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
you 50% of of what uh whatever is
 
06:41:22.070 --> 06:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
collected you know or or are we somehow
 
06:41:25.150 --> 06:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
enforcing that by we write the check to
 
06:41:26.788 --> 06:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
the attorney and we write the check to
 
06:41:28.708 --> 06:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
the victim or something like that yeah I
 
06:41:32.230 --> 06:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
mean we we we write the checks the way
 
06:41:33.990 --> 06:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
we write the checks at the end of the
 
06:41:37.030 --> 06:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
day and so the way we can enforce it is
 
06:41:39.150 --> 06:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
to say you're you know the award for the
 
06:41:41.388 --> 06:41:41.398 align:start position:0%
attorney is going to be this here here
 
06:41:42.990 --> 06:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
is what the attorney
 
06:41:43.000 --> 06:41:44.990 align:start position:0%
is what the attorney
gets

06:41:44.990 --> 06:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
gets
 
06:41:48.388 --> 06:41:48.398 align:start position:0%
look all of us are free as individuals
 
06:41:50.868 --> 06:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
to enter into contracts under terms that
 
06:41:50.878 --> 06:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
to enter into contracts under terms that
we

06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:41:55.750 --> 06:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
decide are best for us or that we are
 
06:41:58.510 --> 06:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
willing to agree to We Can't Stop a
 
06:42:01.230 --> 06:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
claimant from agreeing to give an
 
06:42:04.230 --> 06:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
attorney more than we have said will
 
06:42:06.150 --> 06:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
award the attorney out of the settlement
 
06:42:08.708 --> 06:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
fund we We Can't Stop a claimant from
 
06:42:10.510 --> 06:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
doing that just like we can't stop
 
06:42:12.708 --> 06:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
anyone else from their freedom to enter
 
06:42:12.718 --> 06:42:13.670 align:start position:0%
anyone else from their freedom to enter
into

06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
into
 
06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
contracts my sense is that's not going
 
06:42:19.788 --> 06:42:19.798 align:start position:0%
to happen that often but look we we
 
06:42:21.910 --> 06:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
can't enforce that it just isn't our
 
06:42:23.708 --> 06:42:23.718 align:start position:0%
role as the government to get into that
 
06:42:25.110 --> 06:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
right so we're more or less saying this
 
06:42:26.948 --> 06:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
is what we'll pay for this kind of a
 
06:42:30.388 --> 06:42:30.398 align:start position:0%
case right that you know we award
 
06:42:35.070 --> 06:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a victim and and the $30,000
 
06:42:38.270 --> 06:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
for attorney there's 130,000 and then
 
06:42:40.510 --> 06:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to you guys how you split it
 
06:42:44.948 --> 06:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
sort of I guess um uh I mean I guess
 
06:42:49.910 --> 06:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've read some some news articles about
 
06:42:53.430 --> 06:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
um that make things sound not so good in
 
06:42:57.150 --> 06:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
the sense that um some attorney loaned
 
06:43:00.190 --> 06:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
his client money and then decided to
 
06:43:03.230 --> 06:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
drop the client and now they have the
 
06:43:05.670 --> 06:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
own kind of case and things like that
 
06:43:10.150 --> 06:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
right I mean yeah I I would just say a
 
06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
couple things on that a first is a
 
06:43:16.230 --> 06:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
caution I I think that in a in a in a
 
06:43:17.590 --> 06:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
situation like this that is as
 
06:43:19.388 --> 06:43:19.398 align:start position:0%
complicated as it is and involves as
 
06:43:21.310 --> 06:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
many claimants as it does and as many
 
06:43:22.788 --> 06:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
different law firms and as many
 
06:43:22.798 --> 06:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
different law firms and as many
different

06:43:23.750 --> 06:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:43:28.070 --> 06:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
lawyers you're always going to have some
 
06:43:32.430 --> 06:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
situations that don't go well um you
 
06:43:32.440 --> 06:43:34.190 align:start position:0%
situations that don't go well um you
also

06:43:34.190 --> 06:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:43:36.670 --> 06:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
I I think cannot always rely on what
 
06:43:40.030 --> 06:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
makes it into you know a news article as
 
06:43:41.990 --> 06:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
being an accurate depiction of of what's
 
06:43:44.310 --> 06:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
happening between a a claimant and their
 
06:43:47.868 --> 06:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
attorney um
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
but I you know we we just we're not
 
06:43:54.670 --> 06:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
going to be able to prevent every
 
06:43:54.680 --> 06:43:57.190 align:start position:0%
going to be able to prevent every
negative

06:43:57.190 --> 06:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
negative
 
06:43:59.910 --> 06:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
situation with something like this but
 
06:44:01.468 --> 06:44:01.478 align:start position:0%
we need to do the best we can to
 
06:44:05.270 --> 06:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
minimize that so that we're if we're
 
06:44:07.110 --> 06:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to do this and as a state we're
 
06:44:09.830 --> 06:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to continue to have this process
 
06:44:12.110 --> 06:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
exist which is ultimately up
 
06:44:14.788 --> 06:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
to the elected policy makers the
 
06:44:17.350 --> 06:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor we want to
 
06:44:18.628 --> 06:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's fulfilling its
 
06:44:20.750 --> 06:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
intended purpose which is to provide
 
06:44:24.150 --> 06:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
compensation to victims and not
 
06:44:28.388 --> 06:44:28.398 align:start position:0%
to be a uh you know a lawyer Employment
 
06:44:31.948 --> 06:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
Act Right so we need we're but
 
06:44:35.310 --> 06:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
Perfection I think will elude Us in any
 
06:44:38.190 --> 06:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
Endeavor that we undertake this one
 
06:44:39.948 --> 06:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
included but we want to get as close to
 
06:44:42.830 --> 06:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
Perfection as we possibly
 
06:44:46.388 --> 06:44:46.398 align:start position:0%
can all right representative W so we
 
06:44:49.270 --> 06:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
heard of a case it was in the paper
 
06:44:52.468 --> 06:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
where somebody went to the lawyer to go
 
06:44:55.388 --> 06:44:55.398 align:start position:0%
to court they saw how slow it was going
 
06:44:57.788 --> 06:44:57.798 align:start position:0%
so they went to the alternative
 
06:45:00.750 --> 06:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
resolution and they got an award then
 
06:45:05.190 --> 06:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
the lawyer sued them 25% of the award
 
06:45:08.310 --> 06:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
which he hadn't done anything to get
 
06:45:11.310 --> 06:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
what happened with that case I don't
 
06:45:15.070 --> 06:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
know you know I I I don't know if if it
 
06:45:17.548 --> 06:45:17.558 align:start position:0%
was if it was the lawyer I'm not sure it
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
was the lawyer suing the claim in it
 
06:45:21.430 --> 06:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
might have been the you know the old
 
06:45:23.948 --> 06:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
lawyer suing the claimant's new lawyer
 
06:45:27.190 --> 06:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
right so claimant first had a
 
06:45:30.190 --> 06:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuit with one attorney they decided
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
to go through the settlement fund with a
 
06:45:35.230 --> 06:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
different attorney got an award and then
 
06:45:37.270 --> 06:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
their old attorney sued the new attorney
 
06:45:39.070 --> 06:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
I think that might be what happened I
 
06:45:41.590 --> 06:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if that has been resolved you
 
06:45:42.868 --> 06:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what's going to happen the
 
06:45:44.548 --> 06:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
state's not a party to that lawsuit
 
06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're obviously going to pay attention
 
06:45:48.628 --> 06:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
you know we we want we want to do what
 
06:45:50.788 --> 06:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
we can to protect the interest of of
 
06:45:52.510 --> 06:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
victims and and the claimants in this
 
06:45:54.510 --> 06:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
process but I'm I don't think that's
 
06:45:57.468 --> 06:45:57.478 align:start position:0%
actually it's been resolved and if it's
 
06:45:59.468 --> 06:45:59.478 align:start position:0%
been settled out of court we wouldn't
 
06:46:01.430 --> 06:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
know we wouldn't know what the result
 
06:46:04.788 --> 06:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
lawyers a bad name
 
06:46:07.708 --> 06:46:07.718 align:start position:0%
if as a lawyer I'm used to you know
 
06:46:10.670 --> 06:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
people saying things like I hate lawyers
 
06:46:12.350 --> 06:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
right so I think most people who aren't
 
06:46:14.150 --> 06:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
lawyers don't like lawyers and those of
 
06:46:15.750 --> 06:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
us who are lawyers have learned to live
 
06:46:18.190 --> 06:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
with that and and we did hear from the
 
06:46:20.868 --> 06:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that there are many cases
 
06:46:23.270 --> 06:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
between victims and people other than
 
06:46:27.150 --> 06:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
the state right so maybe contractors or
 
06:46:31.468 --> 06:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
other people that worked in the YDC area
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
right and true so so they're getting a
 
06:46:36.990 --> 06:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
burden with cases that are completely
 
06:46:40.190 --> 06:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
separate from what we're paying victims
 
06:46:43.070 --> 06:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
right so yeah yes that's true I I will
 
06:46:46.030 --> 06:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
say that a lot of the cases that
 
06:46:48.910 --> 06:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
involve parties other than the state
 
06:46:51.510 --> 06:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
still have the state in them so e even
 
06:46:54.750 --> 06:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
if there are cases against contractors
 
06:46:57.468 --> 06:46:57.478 align:start position:0%
often the state has still also been sued
 
06:46:59.750 --> 06:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
in those cases for negligent supervision
 
06:47:01.948 --> 06:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
of the contractor because the state is
 
06:47:04.590 --> 06:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
the one who contracts with that with
 
06:47:08.468 --> 06:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
that entity so it's uh we've been looped
 
06:47:11.110 --> 06:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
into most of this and but when somebody
 
06:47:13.150 --> 06:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
settles through the settlement process
 
06:47:15.948 --> 06:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
presumably they sign a paper saying
 
06:47:17.948 --> 06:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
we're no longer going to claim against
 
06:47:21.510 --> 06:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
the state in these side kind of
 
06:47:24.628 --> 06:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
situations right the settlement is all a
 
06:47:26.670 --> 06:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
settlement of all
 
06:47:29.230 --> 06:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
claims the settle the something like
 
06:47:30.628 --> 06:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
that if you resolve through the
 
06:47:32.150 --> 06:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
settlement fund process you're only
 
06:47:33.708 --> 06:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
resolving CLA claims that you can be
 
06:47:35.830 --> 06:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
compensated for by the settlement fund
 
06:47:39.910 --> 06:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
process so you know there are a few
 
06:47:42.110 --> 06:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
tangential claims that can hang out
 
06:47:43.388 --> 06:47:43.398 align:start position:0%
there even after you go through the
 
06:47:45.868 --> 06:47:45.878 align:start position:0%
settlement fund process I think the
 
06:47:48.388 --> 06:47:48.398 align:start position:0%
reality is that even if those claims
 
06:47:50.310 --> 06:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
still exist they're not going to be
 
06:47:52.670 --> 06:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
claims that you're going to be able to
 
06:47:56.270 --> 06:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
recover very much if anything on against
 
06:47:58.590 --> 06:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
the state at least so while they may not
 
06:48:01.230 --> 06:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
technically be released and extinguished
 
06:48:02.910 --> 06:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
they not claims were going to be too
 
06:48:05.190 --> 06:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
worried about about uh as far as being
 
06:48:07.750 --> 06:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
high exposure claims all right all right
 
06:48:09.350 --> 06:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
let's move on from YDC and with
 
06:48:11.990 --> 06:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative months thank you Mr
 
06:48:16.150 --> 06:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I'm not I'm not a lawyer
 
06:48:18.670 --> 06:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
um and I've I've never worked in law
 
06:48:23.468 --> 06:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and I I I I offer that
 
06:48:25.830 --> 06:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
because um I'm going to ask a question
 
06:48:29.190 --> 06:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
about another topic area that's um shall
 
06:48:30.750 --> 06:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
we say been in the news quite a bit
 
06:48:33.388 --> 06:48:33.398 align:start position:0%
lately and I'm I'm not trying to play
 
06:48:35.548 --> 06:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
gotcha I just I'm trying to understand
 
06:48:38.868 --> 06:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
exactly what the lay of the land is
 
06:48:42.070 --> 06:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
um are there any guidelines that the
 
06:48:45.708 --> 06:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice has issued to
 
06:48:50.190 --> 06:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement on how they should
 
06:48:53.310 --> 06:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
um enforce immigration
 
06:48:56.750 --> 06:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
laws uh and if there are no guidelines
 
06:48:59.990 --> 06:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
will guidelines be sent to them to
 
06:49:03.948 --> 06:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
provide some some Direction
 
06:49:06.350 --> 06:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
there are no guidelines we've issued
 
06:49:08.510 --> 06:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
recently and I haven't made any
 
06:49:09.910 --> 06:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
determination at this point as to
 
06:49:12.750 --> 06:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
whether we'll be issuing any any
 
06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
guidance yet I so I no recent guidance
 
06:49:19.190 --> 06:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
whether there's guidance from many years
 
06:49:20.948 --> 06:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
past that would probably be obsolete now
 
06:49:23.670 --> 06:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
anyway I I don't know that for sure and
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't made any determination at
 
06:49:27.350 --> 06:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
this point whether we'd be issuing any
 
06:49:29.270 --> 06:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
guidance I don't have any plans in the
 
06:49:32.230 --> 06:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
near future to do that is there is there
 
06:49:34.590 --> 06:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
um is there precedent for doing that um
 
06:49:36.948 --> 06:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
you know providing some kind of
 
06:49:40.430 --> 06:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
guideline that would apply Statewide yes
 
06:49:42.868 --> 06:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
we do we do issue guidance to law
 
06:49:44.948 --> 06:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement on various topics we'll
 
06:49:47.590 --> 06:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes issue memos to law enforcement
 
06:49:49.868 --> 06:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
directing them to operate a certain way
 
06:49:55.990 --> 06:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:00.468 --> 06:50:00.478 align:start position:0%
cases all right thank you um so let's um
 
06:50:02.788 --> 06:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
let's move on to just general budget
 
06:50:05.430 --> 06:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
type of things so we have a piece of
 
06:50:07.230 --> 06:50:07.240 align:start position:0%
paper here which shows us the whole
 
06:50:11.270 --> 06:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
state budget of comparing um fiscal year
 
06:50:15.910 --> 06:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
19 to fiscal year 25 for General funds
 
06:50:18.708 --> 06:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
and your your department has the
 
06:50:21.430 --> 06:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
distinction of having the greatest
 
06:50:24.270 --> 06:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
increase of General funds of anything on
 
06:50:27.750 --> 06:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
this piece of paper of
 
06:50:32.948 --> 06:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
104% right so you used in fiscal year 19
 
06:50:36.270 --> 06:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh 10.9 million of General funds and in
 
06:50:39.270 --> 06:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25
 
06:50:42.670 --> 06:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
22.2 million of General funds so that's
 
06:50:45.628 --> 06:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
a that's a huge increase and looking at
 
06:50:47.948 --> 06:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
this paper that you gave us of the new
 
06:50:50.310 --> 06:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
positions it sort of makes it obvious
 
06:50:52.548 --> 06:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
where where this money is going to right
 
06:50:55.230 --> 06:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
because there's pages and pages of new
 
06:51:01.510 --> 06:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
positions so why is so so can we justify
 
06:51:04.628 --> 06:51:04.638 align:start position:0%
why things are so different today than
 
06:51:08.030 --> 06:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
they were only six years
 
06:51:10.830 --> 06:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
ago yeah so I'll take I think there's a
 
06:51:12.590 --> 06:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
couple of different points to make on
 
06:51:15.510 --> 06:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
that the first is
 
06:51:19.788 --> 06:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:23.948 --> 06:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
increase is not all of it and in fact I
 
06:51:26.070 --> 06:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even say the majority of it is
 
06:51:28.708 --> 06:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits for new positions so
 
06:51:32.548 --> 06:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
I think over a big chunk of it about 5
 
06:51:36.388 --> 06:51:36.398 align:start position:0%
$2 million are just grants general fund
 
06:51:39.388 --> 06:51:39.398 align:start position:0%
grants that we just give out to to
 
06:51:42.350 --> 06:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
others so to the child advocacy centers
 
06:51:44.388 --> 06:51:44.398 align:start position:0%
to the internet crimes against children
 
06:51:47.670 --> 06:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
task force to to local departments on
 
06:51:50.270 --> 06:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
the drug task force and and human
 
06:51:53.948 --> 06:51:53.958 align:start position:0%
trafficking grants so about $5.2 million
 
06:51:56.230 --> 06:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
of that based on the numbers that I've
 
06:51:58.070 --> 06:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
got here can we get a a sheet
 
06:52:01.110 --> 06:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
specifically about that yes we will we
 
06:52:03.670 --> 06:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
will we will get you that um so about
 
06:52:05.830 --> 06:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
$5.2 million of that is not related to
 
06:52:08.350 --> 06:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
the operations of the
 
06:52:11.548 --> 06:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
department and then another roughly
 
06:52:15.190 --> 06:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars is rent to das so our
 
06:52:17.948 --> 06:52:17.958 align:start position:0%
rent has gone up like the rent we pay
 
06:52:21.190 --> 06:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
given the our move right our move from
 
06:52:24.548 --> 06:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
our old building to a new building had
 
06:52:26.628 --> 06:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of renovations to that space
 
06:52:28.350 --> 06:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
it was built into the lease so that's
 
06:52:30.948 --> 06:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
another million dollars of that general
 
06:52:33.270 --> 06:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
fund increase so I think that's a that's
 
06:52:35.750 --> 06:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
a first important point to note is that
 
06:52:38.670 --> 06:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of that is
 
06:52:42.628 --> 06:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
not salary and benefits for positions um
 
06:52:43.830 --> 06:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of the general fund
 
06:52:45.510 --> 06:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
increase so there are new positions but
 
06:52:47.310 --> 06:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of the general fund increase even
 
06:52:50.150 --> 06:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
associated with all of our positions are
 
06:52:52.708 --> 06:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
just raises salary raises so there was
 
06:52:55.430 --> 06:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
obviously in the last bium the Big 12
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know 12% raise across across the
 
06:53:00.548 --> 06:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
board so we have
 
06:53:02.990 --> 06:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
received quite a few new positions in
 
06:53:05.388 --> 06:53:05.398 align:start position:0%
The Last 5 Years I don't know how this
 
06:53:08.430 --> 06:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
compares to other departments throughout
 
06:53:10.708 --> 06:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
the state I just I don't I don't have a
 
06:53:12.430 --> 06:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
sense of that I can talk a little bit
 
06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
about where these tell you from the ones
 
06:53:17.270 --> 06:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing you know there might
 
06:53:19.510 --> 06:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
be two here or three there that kind of
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
thing but this looks like 30 or
 
06:53:24.030 --> 06:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
something you know what I mean it's a
 
06:53:29.590 --> 06:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
lot yep no it's certainly a lot I I mean
 
06:53:33.030 --> 06:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
the 10 of those are
 
06:53:35.190 --> 06:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
the assistant Deputy medical examiners
 
06:53:38.510 --> 06:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
who are now we did this in the last BM
 
06:53:40.548 --> 06:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
we now have full-time employees where
 
06:53:42.910 --> 06:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
they used to be contractors so they're
 
06:53:46.190 --> 06:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
not really new people they're they're
 
06:53:49.310 --> 06:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
new positions but they're there it's
 
06:53:51.070 --> 06:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
actually less people now working with
 
06:53:53.190 --> 06:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
the Department we used to have 20-some
 
06:53:55.510 --> 06:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
contractors we now just have 10
 
06:53:58.670 --> 06:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
full-time salaried employees and that
 
06:54:01.388 --> 06:54:01.398 align:start position:0%
actually did not result in a cost
 
06:54:03.548 --> 06:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
increase to the office office so that's
 
06:54:07.270 --> 06:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:07.280 --> 06:54:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
positions

06:54:08.390 --> 06:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
positions
 
06:54:08.400 --> 06:54:09.788 align:start position:0%
positions
[Music]

06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:54:11.830 --> 06:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
we we
 
06:54:14.350 --> 06:54:14.360 align:start position:0%
added some and I think this will be a
 
06:54:16.070 --> 06:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
conversation that we should probably
 
06:54:17.830 --> 06:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
have again in our budget presentation
 
06:54:19.670 --> 06:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
because I will say I expect some of
 
06:54:21.990 --> 06:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
these positions are going to be unfunded
 
06:54:23.190 --> 06:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get out in front of the
 
06:54:25.350 --> 06:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
governor like I want to let her present
 
06:54:27.350 --> 06:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
her budget but I think some of these
 
06:54:29.948 --> 06:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
positions are going to be unfunded so
 
06:54:32.830 --> 06:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
the list we you have today
 
06:54:35.070 --> 06:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to look a little
 
06:54:37.670 --> 06:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
different when we're back before you
 
06:54:38.910 --> 06:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
when the governor has submitted her
 
06:54:41.948 --> 06:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
budget sure and is this list as salaries
 
06:54:45.628 --> 06:54:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:48.670 --> 06:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
benefit that would be a Kathy question
 
06:54:52.070 --> 06:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
so I just put the salaries on there yes
 
06:54:54.310 --> 06:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
all right at this time but I can get you
 
06:54:57.310 --> 06:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
a more comprehensive if you need it
 
06:54:59.070 --> 06:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
great yeah did I see representative
 
06:54:59.080 --> 06:55:00.350 align:start position:0%
great yeah did I see representative
Lehman's

06:55:00.350 --> 06:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
Lehman's
 
06:55:02.788 --> 06:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
hand yeah thank you Mr chair I just
 
06:55:05.868 --> 06:55:05.878 align:start position:0%
think In fairness uh over the last
 
06:55:09.670 --> 06:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
several years or terms uh we as a
 
06:55:11.628 --> 06:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
legislature have asked the Attorney
 
06:55:13.910 --> 06:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
General to bring in like an elderly
 
06:55:16.868 --> 06:55:16.878 align:start position:0%
Fraud Unit which we supported more staff
 
06:55:20.388 --> 06:55:20.398 align:start position:0%
and uh so we've been part of that
 
06:55:22.830 --> 06:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
increased supportive of his budget going
 
06:55:24.670 --> 06:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
up so they could hire additional lawyers
 
06:55:26.830 --> 06:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
to take care of the fraud and especially
 
06:55:28.990 --> 06:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
the elderly abuse that we talked about
 
06:55:31.350 --> 06:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
last term right yeah the new so I was
 
06:55:33.708 --> 06:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
going to I'm perf Al willing to take all
 
06:55:36.670 --> 06:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
the blame or you know whatever you know
 
06:55:38.708 --> 06:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
as you move that elderly side of the
 
06:55:41.708 --> 06:55:41.718 align:start position:0%
table yeah yeah yeah I I understand no
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying he's doing anything
 
06:55:46.388 --> 06:55:46.398 align:start position:0%
illegal or anything you know what I mean
 
06:55:48.788 --> 06:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just that now that we're
 
06:55:50.430 --> 06:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
looking under the couch cushions for
 
06:55:54.150 --> 06:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
loose change you know we we got to go
 
06:55:55.910 --> 06:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
the to the places that have had the most
 
06:55:58.110 --> 06:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
increase I mean that's all it is okay
 
06:56:00.788 --> 06:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
anyways go Ahad yeah no and and we could
 
06:56:02.548 --> 06:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
certainly continue to walk through it so
 
06:56:03.990 --> 06:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's that there's the elder abuse
 
06:56:06.270 --> 06:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
Financial exploitation unit the data
 
06:56:08.110 --> 06:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
privacy unit which was created as part
 
06:56:11.990 --> 06:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the State's new data Privacy Law
 
06:56:14.430 --> 06:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
we've added resources to the election
 
06:56:16.628 --> 06:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
law unit to try to beef up our election
 
06:56:20.670 --> 06:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement we added a new public
 
06:56:23.110 --> 06:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
Integrity unit that's a new unit in the
 
06:56:24.830 --> 06:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
last five years that was four new
 
06:56:28.468 --> 06:56:28.478 align:start position:0%
lawyers a few new staff so there are
 
06:56:29.868 --> 06:56:29.878 align:start position:0%
there are new functions that have been
 
06:56:31.548 --> 06:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
added to the office that have accounted
 
06:56:34.510 --> 06:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
for a lot of these new
 
06:56:39.310 --> 06:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
positions and we have also we've added a
 
06:56:42.388 --> 06:56:42.398 align:start position:0%
couple of new civil litigator
 
06:56:45.670 --> 06:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
positions we've added a couple of new
 
06:56:47.388 --> 06:56:47.398 align:start position:0%
we've added you know some new attorney
 
06:56:50.750 --> 06:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
positions in various bureaus at the end
 
06:56:52.548 --> 06:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:56:54.868 --> 06:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
day the work that the Department of
 
06:56:59.468 --> 06:56:59.478 align:start position:0%
Justice does is we sort of just have to
 
06:57:02.388 --> 06:57:02.398 align:start position:0%
do the work that that comes in and if we
 
06:57:04.708 --> 06:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
don't have the people to do the work we
 
06:57:08.310 --> 06:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
have to hire outside Council to do it so
 
06:57:10.750 --> 06:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
our I would actually submit that our
 
06:57:12.430 --> 06:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
biggest CH
 
06:57:15.110 --> 06:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
our our biggest goal when it comes to
 
06:57:17.830 --> 06:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
efficiencies is to be able to hand is to
 
06:57:20.788 --> 06:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
have enough employees to handle the work
 
06:57:23.590 --> 06:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we do need to do that really is
 
06:57:25.468 --> 06:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
thrust upon us it's for the most part
 
06:57:28.150 --> 06:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
not discretionary work as opposed to
 
06:57:31.468 --> 06:57:31.478 align:start position:0%
having to hire outside counsel and the
 
06:57:34.548 --> 06:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
the workload on the office when you
 
06:57:37.110 --> 06:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
start to think of various cases that
 
06:57:38.670 --> 06:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with over the last 5
 
06:57:41.548 --> 06:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
to six years has really increased pretty
 
06:57:43.788 --> 06:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
significantly YDC being one of the major
 
06:57:46.150 --> 06:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
cost drivers but the school funding
 
06:57:49.670 --> 06:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
cases some other big class action cases
 
06:57:51.628 --> 06:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with with with
 
06:57:54.948 --> 06:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
HHS um trying to expand what we're doing
 
06:57:56.990 --> 06:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the election law area but also
 
06:57:59.670 --> 06:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
handling various civil lawsuits where
 
06:58:01.708 --> 06:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
the state sued over over laws that we
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
pass you know the the workload has
 
06:58:07.030 --> 06:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
increased so I I think that there are
 
06:58:09.070 --> 06:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that we can find in the
 
06:58:11.070 --> 06:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
office we've been going through that
 
06:58:12.670 --> 06:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
process in the governor's budget and
 
06:58:14.788 --> 06:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly be seeing some like I
 
06:58:18.070 --> 06:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
said some positions will be unfunded and
 
06:58:19.310 --> 06:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's something we have to
 
06:58:22.070 --> 06:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
continue to to look carefully at but I
 
06:58:24.070 --> 06:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
also think that when you walk through
 
06:58:26.910 --> 06:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
the new positions we have and you look
 
06:58:28.910 --> 06:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
at the general fund increase over the
 
06:58:30.830 --> 06:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
last 5 to six
 
06:58:33.350 --> 06:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
years a a lot of the new positions we
 
06:58:35.230 --> 06:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
have are either the admes like I said
 
06:58:36.990 --> 06:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
who were just converted from contractors
 
06:58:38.990 --> 06:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
or new functions that the office has
 
06:58:43.070 --> 06:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
been asked to do or tasked with doing or
 
06:58:45.868 --> 06:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
they are directly related to a workload
 
06:58:47.510 --> 06:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
that has increased because at the end of
 
06:58:50.388 --> 06:58:50.398 align:start position:0%
the day we serve a a lot of our
 
06:58:51.868 --> 06:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
functions to serve the rest of state
 
06:58:53.510 --> 06:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
government so if the rest of state
 
06:58:56.190 --> 06:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
government grows we're going to grow
 
06:58:58.590 --> 06:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
because we serve state government but we
 
06:59:00.990 --> 06:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
can certainly be prepared to walk
 
06:59:03.030 --> 06:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
through that
 
06:59:04.548 --> 06:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
in a more detailed fashion because I
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
know for this presentation you asked us
 
06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
06:59:10.350 --> 06:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
list when we're back before you in a
 
06:59:12.310 --> 06:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
couple weeks with the governor's budget
 
06:59:15.910 --> 06:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have the the most upto-date list
 
06:59:17.868 --> 06:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
of positions that are still not unfunded
 
06:59:19.670 --> 06:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
that are new in the last five to six
 
06:59:21.548 --> 06:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
years and we'll certainly be prepared to
 
06:59:23.270 --> 06:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
walk through those and explain to you
 
06:59:25.670 --> 06:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
why those exist and why we think we
 
06:59:27.948 --> 06:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
should still have them and you of course
 
06:59:29.830 --> 06:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
will have to decide whether we
 
06:59:32.468 --> 06:59:32.478 align:start position:0%
should and it's not that you're total
 
06:59:35.708 --> 06:59:35.718 align:start position:0%
funds are necessarily they're up a
 
06:59:38.070 --> 06:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
little more than so the way we look at
 
06:59:41.708 --> 06:59:41.718 align:start position:0%
this is there's been like 30% worth of
 
06:59:44.388 --> 06:59:44.398 align:start position:0%
inflation and population growth over
 
06:59:46.910 --> 06:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
this six-year period of time and your
 
06:59:52.590 --> 06:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
total funds are up um let's see here
 
06:59:55.270 --> 06:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
37% right so that's not you know it's a
 
06:59:57.788 --> 06:59:57.798 align:start position:0%
little high but it's not outrageous it
 
07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
but it's the general the mix has shifted
 
07:00:02.830 --> 07:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
towards General funds
 
07:00:04.830 --> 07:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of the key thing and
 
07:00:06.948 --> 07:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
I think that has a lot to do with grants
 
07:00:09.628 --> 07:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
and rent frankly if you if you take the
 
07:00:11.910 --> 07:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
grants and rent out of that okay you're
 
07:00:13.468 --> 07:00:13.478 align:start position:0%
going to knock off a lot of that percent
 
07:00:15.468 --> 07:00:15.478 align:start position:0%
increase thank you representative eel
 
07:00:17.948 --> 07:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
and then representative R okay I have
 
07:00:20.350 --> 07:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
couple questions so I I don't know if
 
07:00:23.230 --> 07:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
you're prepared to do this today but um
 
07:00:26.590 --> 07:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
we've been uh asking the agencies to
 
07:00:30.030 --> 07:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
share with us specifically what's being
 
07:00:33.590 --> 07:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
cut um you know because the governor has
 
07:00:36.990 --> 07:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
asked people to cut by like 4% and I
 
07:00:39.548 --> 07:00:39.558 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's helpful for us to
 
07:00:42.070 --> 07:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
understand where those cuts are and what
 
07:00:44.548 --> 07:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
the impacts of the of the cuts are so I
 
07:00:46.868 --> 07:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you're prepared to do
 
07:00:49.948 --> 07:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
that today or maybe more in detail it's
 
07:00:51.230 --> 07:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
07:00:56.468 --> 07:00:56.478 align:start position:0%
late yeah I I would request to defer on
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
that until our next presentation and and
 
07:01:02.350 --> 07:01:02.360 align:start position:0%
and partly I could go through that with
 
07:01:03.990 --> 07:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
you but I also I know based on the
 
07:01:05.150 --> 07:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
discussions we're having with the
 
07:01:05.160 --> 07:01:07.670 align:start position:0%
discussions we're having with the
governor's

07:01:07.670 --> 07:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
07:01:11.270 --> 07:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
office I I am reluctant to get out in
 
07:01:13.750 --> 07:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
front of her as as far as what the cuts
 
07:01:16.868 --> 07:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
are going to be yeah so that's okay so
 
07:01:21.750 --> 07:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
then the the other question is um so
 
07:01:24.510 --> 07:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
have we gotten the money I'm I'm
 
07:01:26.230 --> 07:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
thinking about your Environmental
 
07:01:28.788 --> 07:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau in particular have we
 
07:01:30.830 --> 07:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
gotten the P
 
07:01:33.910 --> 07:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
settlement money and are there other
 
07:01:37.230 --> 07:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
huge lawsuits that we're involved in
 
07:01:39.670 --> 07:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
that might have large payouts in the way
 
07:01:42.628 --> 07:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
that the past that's my two questions I
 
07:01:44.670 --> 07:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe we have received the first
 
07:01:47.590 --> 07:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
trunch of the money yet it'll be fairly
 
07:01:50.230 --> 07:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
soon I can get you a a better estimate
 
07:01:53.350 --> 07:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
on that it's not in yet it goes into the
 
07:01:55.548 --> 07:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
trust fund I don't believe that money is
 
07:01:55.558 --> 07:01:57.468 align:start position:0%
trust fund I don't believe that money is
in

07:01:57.468 --> 07:01:57.478 align:start position:0%
in
 
07:02:00.670 --> 07:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
yet even the 65 million I think that's
 
07:02:03.388 --> 07:02:03.398 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to that's only a a
 
07:02:06.750 --> 07:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
portion of our of the total value of of
 
07:02:09.110 --> 07:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
that case that only covers a portion of
 
07:02:11.468 --> 07:02:11.478 align:start position:0%
the claims so we think there's still a
 
07:02:14.388 --> 07:02:14.398 align:start position:0%
lot to do in the P cases with regard to
 
07:02:18.350 --> 07:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
potential recovery uh we are involved we
 
07:02:20.270 --> 07:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
have our social media cases so our
 
07:02:23.070 --> 07:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
social media investigations some of our
 
07:02:25.468 --> 07:02:25.478 align:start position:0%
lawsuits hopeful that eventually those
 
07:02:28.110 --> 07:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
will lead not only to significant
 
07:02:30.548 --> 07:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
changes in that with how those companies
 
07:02:33.430 --> 07:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
operate but also some Financial
 
07:02:37.948 --> 07:02:37.958 align:start position:0%
recoveries uh we have our we still have
 
07:02:41.388 --> 07:02:41.398 align:start position:0%
some opioid litigation ongoing which
 
07:02:43.708 --> 07:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
will lead to more recoveries those those
 
07:02:45.910 --> 07:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
are some of the big cases but we're
 
07:02:47.310 --> 07:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
we're involved in a lot of different
 
07:02:49.910 --> 07:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
Multistate cases so Attorneys General
 
07:02:52.350 --> 07:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
will work with AGS around the country
 
07:02:53.628 --> 07:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
especially in the consumer protection
 
07:02:56.910 --> 07:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
space on multi-state cases that that
 
07:02:59.670 --> 07:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
that bring in recoveries so there are a
 
07:03:01.788 --> 07:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
number of cases we're involved in that
 
07:03:05.990 --> 07:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
we expect will get money in for p cases
 
07:03:08.750 --> 07:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
being a big part of that and the 65
 
07:03:10.590 --> 07:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
million is not the end of the recovery
 
07:03:12.510 --> 07:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
in those cases we expect to get
 
07:03:14.190 --> 07:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
significantly more but that's going to
 
07:03:16.948 --> 07:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
play out in the coming years well I ask
 
07:03:19.030 --> 07:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
because I know from the from past
 
07:03:20.708 --> 07:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
experience that some of those
 
07:03:23.670 --> 07:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
settlements go into the general fund and
 
07:03:26.628 --> 07:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
we end up being able to use them for
 
07:03:28.590 --> 07:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
things yep yeah every time I do my
 
07:03:30.150 --> 07:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
budget presentation whether it's the
 
07:03:32.270 --> 07:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
governor or the legislature the in the
 
07:03:33.948 --> 07:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
actual sort of budget presentation I
 
07:03:36.310 --> 07:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
always have a a page that shows you the
 
07:03:41.070 --> 07:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
money we bring in and I and I yes and
 
07:03:42.750 --> 07:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's always far more than the but I
 
07:03:44.788 --> 07:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
assume it's hard to predict so all right
 
07:03:48.030 --> 07:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
representative run thank you uh Mr chair
 
07:03:50.190 --> 07:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know I apologize if you answered
 
07:03:51.910 --> 07:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
this already and I'm a newbie to this
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee but other funds what are some
 
07:03:55.628 --> 07:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
of those other
 
07:03:58.990 --> 07:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
funds can you answer that yes so we
 
07:04:01.990 --> 07:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
receive uh like our charitable Trust
 
07:04:08.788 --> 07:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
unit they're 100% funded from um fees oh
 
07:04:11.310 --> 07:04:11.320 align:start position:0%
um that because they work with the
 
07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and um trustees charitable
 
07:04:19.628 --> 07:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
trustees uh the administr uh the admes
 
07:04:22.150 --> 07:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
the assistant Deputy medical examiners
 
07:04:24.670 --> 07:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
they're all paid for they're 100%
 
07:04:27.310 --> 07:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
self-funded from um payments that they
 
07:04:30.510 --> 07:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
receive from funeral homes for uh death
 
07:04:32.990 --> 07:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
certificates and cremation views they
 
07:04:36.548 --> 07:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
have to view everybody um and certify
 
07:04:40.150 --> 07:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
everybody before it's cremated kind and
 
07:04:44.190 --> 07:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
um and counties for death investigations
 
07:04:48.150 --> 07:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
so counties reimburse for death
 
07:04:50.310 --> 07:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
investigations so those are probably our
 
07:04:54.510 --> 07:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
most major other funds that we receive
 
07:04:56.030 --> 07:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then uh one other
 
07:04:57.708 --> 07:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
question I noticed there's a
 
07:05:00.788 --> 07:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
position um that was transferred from De
 
07:05:04.990 --> 07:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
a legal assist ENT and then um there's a
 
07:05:08.788 --> 07:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
an attorney an environmental attorney um
 
07:05:11.990 --> 07:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
that was filled that's half well 44%
 
07:05:15.708 --> 07:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
general fund 56% other and it it brings
 
07:05:20.468 --> 07:05:20.478 align:start position:0%
to mind the fact that does dees they
 
07:05:23.548 --> 07:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
staff attorneys as well right so what's
 
07:05:26.350 --> 07:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
the the how is this this position
 
07:05:30.110 --> 07:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
distinguished from um attorneys that are
 
07:05:33.070 --> 07:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
within Dees
 
07:05:36.110 --> 07:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
so Dees like other agencies does have a
 
07:05:38.868 --> 07:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
few lawyers in the agency but they'll do
 
07:05:40.910 --> 07:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
things like help the agency write
 
07:05:44.548 --> 07:05:44.558 align:start position:0%
rules um stuff like that they don't they
 
07:05:46.590 --> 07:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
don't represent the agency in court
 
07:05:48.070 --> 07:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
bring enforcement
 
07:05:50.750 --> 07:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
actions okay do things like that so that
 
07:05:52.990 --> 07:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's what distinguishes a doj lawyer
 
07:05:57.708 --> 07:05:57.718 align:start position:0%
from from a Dees lawyer um I I think the
 
07:05:58.708 --> 07:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which position you're
 
07:06:00.948 --> 07:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
referring to that as a a funding
 
07:06:02.948 --> 07:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
breakdown of some general funds some
 
07:06:04.788 --> 07:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
other funds but we do have a few
 
07:06:07.590 --> 07:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
positions in the office where an agency
 
07:06:08.990 --> 07:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
like the Department of
 
07:06:11.590 --> 07:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance who is not General funded
 
07:06:13.590 --> 07:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're funded by the various
 
07:06:19.670 --> 07:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
assessments on on that they um assess I
 
07:06:20.910 --> 07:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't like the word use of the word
 
07:06:22.830 --> 07:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
impose but I guess it's imposed impose
 
07:06:24.510 --> 07:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
assessments on on companies they're
 
07:06:25.830 --> 07:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
that's the way they're
 
07:06:29.548 --> 07:06:29.558 align:start position:0%
funded they they fund at least part of a
 
07:06:31.030 --> 07:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
position in the office there's a couple
 
07:06:33.270 --> 07:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
agencies to do that where the position
 
07:06:36.468 --> 07:06:36.478 align:start position:0%
actually exists in doj it works for doj
 
07:06:39.350 --> 07:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
but they do the they much of the work
 
07:06:42.750 --> 07:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
they do is to assist the department of
 
07:06:45.030 --> 07:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
insurance or whatever other agency so
 
07:06:49.310 --> 07:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
that agency pays for part or all of a
 
07:06:50.990 --> 07:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
position so we have a couple of
 
07:06:53.590 --> 07:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
arrangements like that and that I'm not
 
07:06:55.310 --> 07:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what position that is but
 
07:06:58.830 --> 07:06:58.840 align:start position:0%
it might yeah it was a new position in
 
07:07:02.350 --> 07:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
2024 okay is it an environmental
 
07:07:04.468 --> 07:07:04.478 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the new en attorney that we
 
07:07:04.478 --> 07:07:05.548 align:start position:0%
yeah it's the new en attorney that we
got

07:07:05.548 --> 07:07:05.558 align:start position:0%
got
 
07:07:09.150 --> 07:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
in24 yeah and so
 
07:07:13.350 --> 07:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's Bureau that whole Bureau is
 
07:07:17.230 --> 07:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
funded 44% General funds
 
07:07:21.708 --> 07:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
56% I call it other but it's transfers
 
07:07:24.830 --> 07:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
from by Environmental Services okay all
 
07:07:26.948 --> 07:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
right thank you all right representative
 
07:07:29.670 --> 07:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
eel followed by representative wer okay
 
07:07:32.350 --> 07:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
let's see how I can ask this question
 
07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
you're a lawyer so you can handle it
 
07:07:38.030 --> 07:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
however um with respect to the uh
 
07:07:41.430 --> 07:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
president's executive order uh ter or
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
halting the payment of federal funds for
 
07:07:47.150 --> 07:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
various programs I know that it has now
 
07:07:50.030 --> 07:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
been temporarily enjoined I know that
 
07:07:53.150 --> 07:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
the governor has expressed concern about
 
07:07:58.910 --> 07:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
it it seems to me that as a state if we
 
07:08:02.510 --> 07:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
have these federal funds that we have
 
07:08:06.270 --> 07:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
gone out and entered into contracts in
 
07:08:09.910 --> 07:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
Reliance on receipt of those funds if we
 
07:08:12.388 --> 07:08:12.398 align:start position:0%
are in those contracts and
 
07:08:15.468 --> 07:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
can't fulfill our side which means pay
 
07:08:15.478 --> 07:08:16.948 align:start position:0%
can't fulfill our side which means pay
for

07:08:16.948 --> 07:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:08:21.910 --> 07:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
them might the state not be liable for
 
07:08:21.920 --> 07:08:23.788 align:start position:0%
them might the state not be liable for
contract

07:08:23.788 --> 07:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
contract
 
07:08:26.190 --> 07:08:26.200 align:start position:0%
violations you can answer that or not
 
07:08:29.150 --> 07:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'm going to keep it pretty
 
07:08:31.628 --> 07:08:31.638 align:start position:0%
General and you know I'm always always
 
07:08:34.548 --> 07:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
going to be pretty uh circumspect about
 
07:08:35.990 --> 07:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
commenting on the state's potential
 
07:08:38.990 --> 07:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
liability in any situation but you know
 
07:08:41.030 --> 07:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
every Grant is different I'll say that
 
07:08:42.990 --> 07:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
most Grant pretty much every Grant
 
07:08:44.708 --> 07:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
agreement though we're going to enter
 
07:08:46.628 --> 07:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
into with someone that involves federal
 
07:08:49.948 --> 07:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
funds is going to have a term that makes
 
07:08:51.750 --> 07:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
the continued receipt the state's
 
07:08:53.830 --> 07:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
continued receipt of the federal funds
 
07:08:55.230 --> 07:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
or or I should say it's going to have a
 
07:08:57.070 --> 07:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
term that makes the agreement contingent
 
07:08:58.708 --> 07:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
on the state's continued receipt of the
 
07:09:02.230 --> 07:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds right so
 
07:09:04.310 --> 07:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
generally at a high level and and
 
07:09:06.948 --> 07:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
looking at it generally I don't I don't
 
07:09:09.670 --> 07:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
have a big concern about the state being
 
07:09:14.590 --> 07:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
liable to a grantee out there if if
 
07:09:16.948 --> 07:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
we're no longer receiving federal funds
 
07:09:19.750 --> 07:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
to to fund the grant so that that
 
07:09:22.948 --> 07:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't concern me um as to
 
07:09:25.590 --> 07:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
whether you know there are there our
 
07:09:27.910 --> 07:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
claims we would have against the federal
 
07:09:30.110 --> 07:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
government in a specific situation where
 
07:09:32.430 --> 07:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
funding is cut off that's just going to
 
07:09:35.510 --> 07:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
depend on the particular Circumstance
 
07:09:37.590 --> 07:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
the way federal grants work and Kathy
 
07:09:39.110 --> 07:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
knows a lot more about this than I do so
 
07:09:40.750 --> 07:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
if I say something wrong I'll let her
 
07:09:44.190 --> 07:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
kick me and correct me but yeah the the
 
07:09:45.868 --> 07:09:45.878 align:start position:0%
way federal grants work is they often
 
07:09:48.788 --> 07:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
stay open for multiple fiscal years so
 
07:09:50.670 --> 07:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
you know it could be three four five
 
07:09:53.750 --> 07:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
years so a grant that was awarded two or
 
07:09:55.468 --> 07:09:55.478 align:start position:0%
three years
 
07:09:59.788 --> 07:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
ago and the award's been made it can
 
07:10:01.788 --> 07:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
continue to be draw drawn down down
 
07:10:03.628 --> 07:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes for several years and those
 
07:10:06.190 --> 07:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
might be different than new grants that
 
07:10:08.750 --> 07:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been awarded yet right so when
 
07:10:12.070 --> 07:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
we think about a federal funding
 
07:10:14.468 --> 07:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
pause you know it's easy to think about
 
07:10:18.350 --> 07:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
it as as just one single concept but it
 
07:10:22.310 --> 07:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
really it what that means can differ
 
07:10:24.510 --> 07:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the Grant and what federal
 
07:10:26.548 --> 07:10:26.558 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we're talking about from
 
07:10:29.190 --> 07:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
that Grant right so are we saying no
 
07:10:30.948 --> 07:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
more Awards will be made under this
 
07:10:33.310 --> 07:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
grant or are we saying you can't draw
 
07:10:36.990 --> 07:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
down even money from fiscal years where
 
07:10:39.270 --> 07:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's already been awarded and what the
 
07:10:41.830 --> 07:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
legal implications of that are might
 
07:10:45.110 --> 07:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
vary a little bit Grant by Grant so
 
07:10:46.990 --> 07:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
we're you didn't really ask this
 
07:10:48.788 --> 07:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
question but I'll but I will at least
 
07:10:51.990 --> 07:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
assure you that at the doj we're working
 
07:10:54.788 --> 07:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
with all of our various agencies on to
 
07:10:57.310 --> 07:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
assess what the potential impact could
 
07:11:02.350 --> 07:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
be of of a pause or eventual
 
07:11:04.830 --> 07:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
discontinuation of of the various
 
07:11:07.350 --> 07:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
sources of federal funds that we get but
 
07:11:09.590 --> 07:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's early days and I think it would be
 
07:11:12.070 --> 07:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
a mistake to jump to conclusions because
 
07:11:14.910 --> 07:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
while the original o andb memo said that
 
07:11:16.230 --> 07:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
all federal funds were going to be
 
07:11:19.788 --> 07:11:19.798 align:start position:0%
paused that was rescinded pretty quickly
 
07:11:21.270 --> 07:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
the White House put out guidance pretty
 
07:11:23.750 --> 07:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
quickly saying the pause is not even
 
07:11:27.030 --> 07:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
really going to apply to Grants outside
 
07:11:28.510 --> 07:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
of those implicated by the president's
 
07:11:32.548 --> 07:11:32.558 align:start position:0%
executive orders and even those are are
 
07:11:35.230 --> 07:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
fairly narrow in the grand scheme of
 
07:11:37.070 --> 07:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
things we're still working to assess and
 
07:11:39.388 --> 07:11:39.398 align:start position:0%
get our arms around it but I don't
 
07:11:42.590 --> 07:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're a somewhat narrow slice
 
07:11:45.230 --> 07:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the overall Universe of federal funds
 
07:11:47.150 --> 07:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
Kathy is there anything that I said
 
07:11:49.230 --> 07:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly wrong that you need to
 
07:11:52.070 --> 07:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
correct kick you at all I mean I'll just
 
07:11:55.350 --> 07:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
say I I feel better knowing that you're
 
07:11:57.788 --> 07:11:57.798 align:start position:0%
work you know not that you wouldn't but
 
07:12:00.548 --> 07:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a concerning situation yeah
 
07:12:03.510 --> 07:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
we've been we've been thinking a lot
 
07:12:06.350 --> 07:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
about this and working a lot on this
 
07:12:08.628 --> 07:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
since the day that this all started
 
07:12:11.350 --> 07:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
which is only a little over a week ago
 
07:12:13.670 --> 07:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
which is amazing to think it hasn't been
 
07:12:15.708 --> 07:12:15.718 align:start position:0%
that long but we're we're working hard
 
07:12:19.030 --> 07:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
on it and everybody's working hard on it
 
07:12:20.388 --> 07:12:20.398 align:start position:0%
all right representative wer for the
 
07:12:22.628 --> 07:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
last question thank you just a couple of
 
07:12:24.788 --> 07:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
quick ones you mentioned that your
 
07:12:27.430 --> 07:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
responsible to passing out grants to
 
07:12:30.190 --> 07:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
these some newly created organizations I
 
07:12:32.230 --> 07:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
would like to see the list because we
 
07:12:34.628 --> 07:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
may decide they're not worth the money
 
07:12:37.270 --> 07:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
that you're passing out and the the
 
07:12:37.280 --> 07:12:38.430 align:start position:0%
that you're passing out and the the
second

07:12:38.430 --> 07:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
second
 
07:12:38.440 --> 07:12:40.150 align:start position:0%
second
question

07:12:40.150 --> 07:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:12:42.910 --> 07:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
these education funding things go on
 
07:12:45.510 --> 07:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
forever and you have to
 
07:12:49.270 --> 07:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
keep um defending them I am always
 
07:12:51.910 --> 07:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
surprised that you never bring in any
 
07:12:54.590 --> 07:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislators as expert Witnesses who have
 
07:12:56.788 --> 07:12:56.798 align:start position:0%
worked for years and know all the
 
07:12:58.590 --> 07:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
iterations of all these things and could
 
07:13:01.990 --> 07:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
provide expert Witnesses and
 
07:13:03.388 --> 07:13:03.398 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General doesn't seem to
 
07:13:07.150 --> 07:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:09.468 --> 07:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
know well I don't think it's I think
 
07:13:11.030 --> 07:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to know better than to lose
 
07:13:12.670 --> 07:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
the case I think we would add to the
 
07:13:14.670 --> 07:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
case when the other we know what the
 
07:13:15.948 --> 07:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
other side is going to say and we could
 
07:13:19.070 --> 07:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
have a little preparation but you you're
 
07:13:21.110 --> 07:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
overlooking expert Witnesses in this
 
07:13:23.590 --> 07:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
legislature all the time to a defend a
 
07:13:25.868 --> 07:13:25.878 align:start position:0%
case that I think we could help you with
 
07:13:28.868 --> 07:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
can I add to that that maybe when does
 
07:13:31.070 --> 07:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
our Supreme Court work like the US
 
07:13:32.590 --> 07:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in the sense that there
 
07:13:35.590 --> 07:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
aren't Witnesses when you take a a case
 
07:13:37.750 --> 07:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court no you you don't
 
07:13:40.628 --> 07:13:40.638 align:start position:0%
have witnesses on on appeal yes it's
 
07:13:42.948 --> 07:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
just questions of law y but I think we
 
07:13:45.350 --> 07:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
could help you prepare the case and we
 
07:13:47.948 --> 07:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
haven't been asked much to do that but
 
07:13:52.670 --> 07:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you appreciate your coming
 
07:13:54.670 --> 07:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you all we'll see you
 
07:13:58.190 --> 07:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:00.270 --> 07:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
weeks for the committee we'll see you
 
07:14:02.468 --> 07:14:02.478 align:start position:0%
tomorrow if anybody is speaking at the
 
07:14:04.868 --> 07:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
well I hope they speak briefly because
 
07:14:08.150 --> 07:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:10.990 --> 07:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
coming no bills for us no but somebody
 
07:14:13.190 --> 07:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
could be arguing something you know on
 
07:14:18.510 --> 07:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
some other bill on I am not no no okay
 
07:14:22.430 --> 07:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
and and um I think after that we have
 
07:14:24.150 --> 07:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's address the following
 
07:14:25.708 --> 07:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
Thursday but I don't think this
 
07:14:28.990 --> 07:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
committee has any schedule next week I
 
07:14:32.510 --> 07:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
believe but I could be wrong
 
07:14:32.520 --> 07:14:35.230 align:start position:0%
believe but I could be wrong
