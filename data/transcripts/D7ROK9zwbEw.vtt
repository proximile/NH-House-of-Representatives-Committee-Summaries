00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
reduction in business taxes
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
and mills and rooms taxes
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%

and house bill 568
 
00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
until we find out
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
what these are all about
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.589 align:start position:0%
 
do

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
hold on a second
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 306
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
and house bill 330
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
are the ones that
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
plan on executing we should be able to
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
do that this morning because the
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
schedule this morning isn't that heavy
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
the heavy schedule is this afternoon
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people signed up
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
to testify on some of these bills
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
so we'll go right to
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:20.790 align:start position:0%
which is house bill
355

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
which i know ways and means doesn't get
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
very many of um this is a pretty
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill um this bill just
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
allows that in towns that have already
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
voted to allow kino
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
to allow that kino which currently only
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
extends to places that have poor
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
licenses or liquor licenses to allow the
 
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
licenses or liquor licenses to allow the
um

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
keto to be expanded as a lottery product
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
to any lottery
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
like a retailer licensed location
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
this is a business bill
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
i know the retail industry is excited
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
for this bill they think it'll help
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
their industry um i i know that you know
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on with covid uh for
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
revenues this will help with the state
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
revenues so again a pretty
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill it just says that
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
in towns that have already voted to
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
allow kino that keno will be extended
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
not only to the poor licensed locations
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
but to the retail licensed lottery
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
locations as well
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm pretty sure i'm probably
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
charlie's on the phone answer questions
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
so you may want to refer to him but i'm

happy to ask and answer any questions
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
on one second i have to
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
catch up with myself
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%

interrupting but
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh when when you think it's ready i do
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
i had
 
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.110 align:start position:0%
i had
representative

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative lang i think you were on
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
the committee when we
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
were doing keno
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
i was just
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
you are right okay so
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
if you remember the testimony from um
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh the uh
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre then
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
he said that massachusetts made a
 
00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:07.269 align:start position:0%
he said that massachusetts made a
mistake

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
by allowing keno to be in venues other
 
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.629 align:start position:0%
by allowing keno to be in venues other
than

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
establishes that pour liquor
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think we i think we passed keno
 
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.190 align:start position:0%
i think we i think we passed keno
because

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't allow it to be in
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
every establishment
 
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
every establishment
um

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
this is why i just want you to kind of
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
give me a sense of why you think this is
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you representative romney
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
for your question and i i guess i have a
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
little bit different recollection of of
 
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.790 align:start position:0%
little bit different recollection of of
um

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
director mcintyre's conversation uh
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
around kino um i don't remember him
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
saying that it was a mistake but i also
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
remember him saying about uh it is a
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
huge revenue generator from
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
massachusetts um and that it was one of
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we were looking to bring
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
keno this bill is being brought forward
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
i worked with the lottery on the
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
drafting of this bill uh when i went
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
into them and explained to them i was
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
gonna i wanted to do some bills
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
regarding um sports betting i told them
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
if they had any other bills that they
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
wish to bring forward i'd be happy to be
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
a conduit for that and this was one of
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
the bills that in working with charlie
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
that he recommended we bring forward
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
so i think you'll find the lottery
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
commission is going to be in favor of
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um and you can probably talk
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
to charlie and he can give you some
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
metrics and some numbers as to why this
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
is a good idea
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
i'll remind all committee members that
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
again kino is a local control option so
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
towns have to vote whether or not to
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
allow and even in the conversation
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
of allowing kino nowhere does it talk
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
about on the ballot
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
um where in the town that kino be
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
allowed it strictly says shall the town
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
allow kino um and you answer yes or no
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
and and that that passes
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
so uh i'll just leave that for the
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
committee representation do you know if
 
00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:04.629 align:start position:0%
committee representation do you know if
uh

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
i've admitted him
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
allowed him to talk
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh chai
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%

mr chairman i think you still have a
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
couple hands raised for questions for me
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
just hold off charlie until we take care
 
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:37.829 align:start position:0%

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the question i have is um
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
keno seems to be a
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
game that you play while you're waiting
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
for meals and
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
sitting around and
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
it's a lounging type of an activity how
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
do you have a lounging activity
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
at a
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
for your question again i i can tell you
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
that um you don't have to be in the
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
building for keno so i could buy a
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
keynote ticket walk away just like i buy
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
a lottery ticket and walk away and wait
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the drawing and then come back and
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
check my ticket um those same activities
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
can be done in a in a retail store that
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
you can buy a keynote ticket walk away
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
and then come back two days later scan
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
your ticket and find out whether or not
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i hope that that
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
noise isn't going to be occurring
 
00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.870 align:start position:0%
noise isn't going to be occurring
uh

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
representative lang
on

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
isn't this a kind of bait and switch
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
that the towns that
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
took keno took it with the understanding
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be in restaurants
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh or bars with food
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
and it is a lounging supposed to be a
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
lounging activity on
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
they are going to be required to put it
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
in every convenience store if the
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
convenience stores want it i don't
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand why convenience stores want
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts unless it's just to turn
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
themselves into k-no parlors because
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
there is isn't it true that that
 
00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.550 align:start position:0%
there is isn't it true that that
on

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
this competes directly with their
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
ability to have any other customers
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
since people are going to be waiting
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
around to look at the ticket
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
let the number come up
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
well again i'm sure someone from the
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
retail association will be speaking my
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
understanding is they are completely in
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill and feel that it will
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
be um help help their overall revenue
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
cycles uh and increase the revenues for
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
those businesses which obviously overall
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
increase the revenues for the state of
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire so
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
my understanding again is the retail
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
industry is in favor of this bill and um
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
on if i may you didn't answer my
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
question about the municipalities having
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
no voice in this being added in
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
to their towns
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
so again uh uh representative obama uh
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
omni thank you for your question i guess
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
they do have a voice and that would be
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
this public hearing um this is a duly
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
noticed public hearing they have every
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity they understand what bills
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
are coming before him i know the new
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association tracks
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
these bills that are relative to
 
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and cities and towns
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
and so i'm sure they've made aware all
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
the communities that are um
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are uh have voted to allow kino and
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
again i'll remind the um
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
members the ballot question that goes on
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
the ballot doesn't talk about poor
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
licenses or lounges or or liquor
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
licenses it strictly says shall the town
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
of whatever allow kino
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.029 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman um
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
i may or may not have this correct but
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
i believe it was a year or two that kino
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
was voted in to help fund kindergarten
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
presumed that uh this will continue
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
funding that or funding other
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
sources i don't know if you're you're
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
so i can i can maybe answer that
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
question because there's been a lot of
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
dancing around this issue um so yes
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
originally uh when keno was introduced
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
into the state legislature back in 2017
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
2017-18 i believe it was and passed it
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
was tied directly to kindergarten the
 
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
revenues going to kindergarten and
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
full-time kindergarten um in the next
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
term um that was the while keno was
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
continued the um it stripped it out as
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
being related directly to kindergarten
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
and now it just goes to the general it
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
goes to the education fund
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:07.730 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.110 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
so representative jan again to
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
representative romney's point we've
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
already moved the ball on this it was
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
originally voted in again under
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
understanding was going to go for
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and then two years later we
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
swapped it so it's not an uncommon
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
practice and the legislature change the
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
rules around
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
what a given
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
program is about
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
right question can i ask a question
 
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.230 align:start position:0%
right question can i ask a question
uh

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
can i is it okay if i ask a question mr
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this is representative nunez
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
hold on a second
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
do you have the ability to raise your
 
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.590 align:start position:0%
do you have the ability to raise your
hand

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%

up on
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh the question asked uh asked by
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative allmey
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
you you've pointed out that the
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
towns that have accepted keno have voted
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
on a ballot question that asks whether
 
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.909 align:start position:0%
on a ballot question that asks whether
they

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
will accept or not
 
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
will accept or not
keno

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
keno
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
but kino was a defined
 
00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:24.789 align:start position:0%
but kino was a defined
term

00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
as defined by statute
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
and at the time that that ballot
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
question was presented
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
it identified kino as an activity that
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
occurring um not in
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
all retail establishments that
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
that have lottery
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
only in a list of
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
of kinds of places that did not extend
 
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.789 align:start position:0%
of kinds of places that did not extend
to

00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
retail stores that
 
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
retail stores that
has

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
lottery activities so um
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's fair to say
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
that in voting
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
to accept kino in in a town
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
that that disposes of the question that
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative army
 
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.029 align:start position:0%
representative army
raised

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
raised
in

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.190 align:start position:0%
in
it

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
unless you know
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
as a fact that when the question was
 
00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:21.669 align:start position:0%
as a fact that when the question was
presented

00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:22.710 align:start position:0%
presented
the

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
discussion made clear that keno was
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
currently only in
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
in such and such places allowed only in
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
such and such places
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
but it might later be allowed in other
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
places and the authorization related to
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
keynote wherever it might
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
be allowed now or in the future
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a significant issue
 
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.029 align:start position:0%
i think that there's a significant issue
here

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the authorization that has been given
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
to keno by places that have voted to
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
allow it
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i'd like you to respond to that
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
sir absolutely representative thank you
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
for your question again i'd say it's not
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
uncommon for the state to uh
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
change a program um and again i'm going
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
to use kino as a direct example so towns
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
that voted after we passed keno were
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
voting based on the fact that uh in the
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
original bill we tied kino to
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
kindergarten people were voting because
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
they thought they were increasing um
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
education education spending
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
specifically to allow full-time
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and that was a completely
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable bill that went through and
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
then two years later and parties changed
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
they decided that no we want to decouple
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
keno from education with no thought of
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
what it meant to the local impact and
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
people that voted for those towns so
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
again it's non-uncommon occurrence that
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
we will decouple or change a rule um and
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that plays around with
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
who's in political power and who's not
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
um but again in this particular bill we
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
went from tino was tied to kindergarten
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
kino was not tied to kindergarten so and
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
and again no one no one argued the
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
argument that well when the towns voted
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
for this they voted because it was tied
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
to kindergarten um the legislature two
 
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
years ago was happy
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
the uh and decouple uh keno from
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten with no impact as to what
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
the towns thought and what they voted on
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
so again it's not an uncommon occurrence
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
um we regularly do this i think um where
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
we have policies and procedures that
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
affect towns and we change those
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures that those
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
talents are uh have so
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
i guess that's my answer to the question
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's not an uncommon occurrence
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
you're also at
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
right yeah i'm going to leave it there
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.350 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
um

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
how did this bill come about did you get
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
requests from lottery retailers that
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to add it to their convenience
 
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.070 align:start position:0%
wanted to add it to their convenience
stores

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.870 align:start position:0%
stores
or

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean has a former grocery store owner
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
and a retail
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
lottery dealer i can't imagine
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
this happening i i mean it's
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
it would it would clutter up the aisles
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative and again uh well what i
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
said what i will say is that i was
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
originally uh bringing bills forward
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
relative to um
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
sports betting and i met with the
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
lottery um and my understanding from
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
lottery is that yes there is a demand
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
for this and there is a request for this
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
and again you know going back to it's no
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
different than when people buy scratch
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
tickets or when people buy any lottery
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
tickets especially the instant ones um
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
some stay there and use them some leave
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
um and in this case again you can buy a
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
keynote ticket walk away come back the
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
next day when you're getting your coffee
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the next morning and check your keynote
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
numbers to see if they won the day
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
before so there's no direct you don't
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to stand there and look at the
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
screen and watch what's going on you can
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
there are some places that
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an example of my little
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
town of sandbridge and here we have a
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
convenience store down on our on route
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
three that has a little breakfast place
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
so you get a coffee place and a lunch
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
place so you could go in and get a buy a
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
sandwich from the deli and go sit down
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
and if they wanted to sell keno there
 
00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
they could put that up assuming our town
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
approved it so there are places where
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
retail it does work where they have
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
small little lunch lunch counter type
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
places where it may work out for them
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
and and help with that insulatory
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
revenue ancillary revenue um so again i
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
worked with lottery on this um it was
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
seemed to be a demand for it and that's
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
why we moved it forward
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%

town passes kino
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
and now lottery makes this change
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
can a town put the kino back on the
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%

we work hard to represent the voice of

our collective membership
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%

bill 355.
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
since 1967 grocery and convenience
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
stores have been partners with the new
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire lottery selling scratch
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
tickets and lotto games to the consumers
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
as well as the cashing of winning
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
tickets for these games up to 599
 
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.310 align:start position:0%
tickets for these games up to 599
dollars

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
though we're not able to sell keno at
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
our locations retailers are able to
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
infrequently cash out the winning
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
keynote tickets now
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
when kino was originally proposed
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
our organization had testified on behalf
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
of retailers so they would be able to
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
participate in keynote when and where
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
communities allowed
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill allowed only for
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
restaurants and buyers to participate
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
while excluding the longest partners of
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire lottery retailer
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier our retailers are
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
already able to cash out these winning
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
keynote tickets we think it's fair the
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
next step would be allowing retailers to
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
participate by selling keno to our joint
 
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.549 align:start position:0%
participate by selling keno to our joint
consumers

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative elmi and gomarlos both
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
brought up a couple of points
 
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.830 align:start position:0%
brought up a couple of points
um

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
not all of our members
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
would jump at the
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
keynote and participate in keno if it
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
was available
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
that would be a decision again based on
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
the community first if it was allowed
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
then a business decision for those
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
businesses within those communities it
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
was something that um
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
would fit their model
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative only brought in you know
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
could you have people loitering around
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
what we found from our members
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
locations in other states that allow
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
kino is that most of these are are doing
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
single purchases when they're cashing an
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
existing winning keynote ticket they're
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
buying an extra ticket with their
 
00:30:26.159 --> 00:30:27.190 align:start position:0%
buying an extra ticket with their
winnings

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
winnings
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
going and do their shopping and coming
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
back and checking it getting a coffee
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
and checking it
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
or taking off leaving and coming back at
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
a subsequent visit
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
we've had others
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know that have now you go into a
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
convenience store it's not your typical
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
you've got these these giant sitting
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
areas and dining areas
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
those would be locations where you could
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
possibly see keno really taking a
 
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
possibly see keno really taking a
foothold

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
foothold
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
but but our retailer would do a good job
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
of making sure like they do now with
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets you have a couple people
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
who sit there and they'll scratch their
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
scratchers and turn them in and
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
take the winnings buy some more and
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
scratch them but they're there for
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
five ten minutes at a time
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
i i don't think the retailer would allow
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
for the continued longevity of somebody
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
just sitting at the counter so they
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
would do a good job of moving along so
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
with those thoughts
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
we encourage the committee in supporting
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
the passage of house bill 355
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%

open to any questions that i may help
with

00:31:32.549 --> 00:31:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative major
 
00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.710 align:start position:0%
uh representative major
representative

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
representative
representative

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um kind of refresh our memory
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
as to there's got to be a reason that
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
you want this for your store all the
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
stores um
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the percent or
 
00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:54.230 align:start position:0%
what is the what is the percent or
uh

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
incentive to the to the stores to to
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
have keno uh
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
what i guess basically what what does
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
the store make
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh financially from doing this
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
there is a commission that's made on the
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
sale of the ticket
 
00:32:10.399 --> 00:32:12.070 align:start position:0%
sale of the ticket
um

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
i believe on aquino
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's in charlie
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong i believe it's eight
 
00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:19.990 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong i believe it's eight
percent

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
sale of that ticket
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we'll follow up with
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
on this is a follow-up to that actually
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh what's the percentage on a scratch
 
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
uh what's the percentage on a scratch
ticket

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
i believe that is at five percent
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
it is definitely less than what kino is
 
00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.909 align:start position:0%
it is definitely less than what kino is
now

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
and that's an argument
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
yes yes i think it speaks for itself
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
the gist of this is that
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
a lottery retailer
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
is licensed
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
if the town has already voted
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
to allow uh the sale of keno
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh of course we we were into that here
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
in salem new hampshire a while ago
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
my question to mr mcintyre is
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
um how long does that
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
stay on the books
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
if a town
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh has already
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
allowed it so in other words
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.549 align:start position:0%
allowed it so in other words
uh

00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
when does the
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
rob are you asking mr mcintyre or mr
 
00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:05.190 align:start position:0%
rob are you asking mr mcintyre or mr
davis

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
davis
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
no i said charles mcintyre
 
00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.190 align:start position:0%
no i said charles mcintyre
he's

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
mr daigle is the one testifying right
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
now so do you have a question for mr
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
daigle oh oh i'm sorry okay
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
i'll wait
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
okay then we will bring in charlie
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
mcintyre thank you
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
and bob you you can ask your question as
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
i was saying
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh we've already voted for keno in salem
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh we're uh
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh we have a long history of gambling
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
because the racetrack used to be here
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
and so people uh 80 percent uh supported
 
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.550 align:start position:0%
and so people uh 80 percent uh supported
keno

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
keno
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
so my question to mrs mcintyre is
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
how often do we allow new people
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
to come in or new towns to come in
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
in order to have uh
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
this possible
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
is the bill
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
is the law
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
for salem is that perpetual is that for
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
the next 50 years
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
and what how does a new town
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
apply do they apply directly to the
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
lottery commission
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
how does that work
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr representative elliot
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
this is charlie mcintyre um
 
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
this is charlie mcintyre um
so

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
we went for the first approvals for
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
towns and cities when kino was adopted
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
and salem obviously approved it
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
we would
not

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
disapprove it unless the tanner city
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
itself disapproved it which is similar
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
to how lottery was adopted the state in
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
when lottery was adopted in 64
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
there were about 20 cities and towns in
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that said no
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
and that tickets weren't sold in those
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
towns and cities until they eventually
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
approved it uh oddly i still think there
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
are three or four towns in new hampshire
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
that completely disapprove of lottery
 
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
that completely disapprove of lottery
sales

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
your hand sorry thank you uh charlie if
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
this passed and
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
on the convenience stores came in i
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
cannot remember from the original bill
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
in any way the original bill seems to
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
have considerably changed in the senate
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
so that a number of the enforcement
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
issues that
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
not enforcement but on
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
issues of the way the rooms were
 
00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.190 align:start position:0%
issues of the way the rooms were
structured

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
have been taken out i did not realize
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
that but on
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
if if this passes
 
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:01.670 align:start position:0%
if if this passes
uh

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.670 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
that
then

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.430 align:start position:0%
then
does

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.230 align:start position:0%
does
the

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh grosser have to the convenience store
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
owner have to pay for anything in the
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
installation or is it like lottery where
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
i believe you
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
you uh provide everything that they need
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
to make it work
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding they would pay the
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
license fee for kena which i believe is
 
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.630 align:start position:0%
license fee for kena which i believe is
500

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
500
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
um the remainder of the equipment and
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
services and the communications would be
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
paid for by us
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
and this would be a store-by-store
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
decision so
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
those that wanted it would
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
take it and those that didn't would not
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
similar to bars and taverns now
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
we probably get one in four bars
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
in every jurisdiction where it's been
 
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:54.790 align:start position:0%
in every jurisdiction where it's been
approved

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you if i could follow up so what
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
you're saying is is it an annual license
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
fee of 500
 
00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:04.710 align:start position:0%
fee of 500
yes

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
and for the five hundred dollars then
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
after that they get
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh eight
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
eight percent of the ticket value what
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
is the license fee for annual license
 
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
fee for
 
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.510 align:start position:0%
fee for
uh

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
until patrick or patrick
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
keep track
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%

uh yeah the guys have been doing that
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
they've been if they wanted to ask a
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
question they're they're they're
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
reaching out to me so fine uh but we

don't have the ability to raise the hand
here

00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
when somebody has physically raised
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
their hand it could be entered into the
 
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.829 align:start position:0%
their hand it could be entered into the
chat

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
chat
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
there is no chat
 
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.710 align:start position:0%
there is no chat
um

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes but maybe i i have a suggestion
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative asks that's a question as
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
a discussion in other committees i've
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
seen uh the
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
the questions from the committee be
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
divided in half go to the people who are
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
online first and then ask if there's
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
anybody in the in the lob that wants to
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
to speak after that just divide it up so
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
that you get everybody covered
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good suggestion we'll do that
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
and now
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
if members of everybody will remind me
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
i think if there are too many of us
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
trying to ask questions that might not
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
work maybe every four people
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
online you could go and ask
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative abrami if there are
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
this afternoon for instance it might be
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
a mess
 
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.069 align:start position:0%
a mess
right

00:40:36.069 --> 00:40:36.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
we'll go we'll try the system out and
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
see how it goes
 
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.589 align:start position:0%
see how it goes
okay

00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
there's only one person
 
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.829 align:start position:0%
there's only one person
online

00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's right represent representative
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
ames you have a question then we'll go
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
to the lobby okay thank you
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%

00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
of facts uh
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
with charlie mcintyre and uh
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%

before he came on
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
and so there were two questions
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
one was
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
community

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
town that has
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%

you know to unaccept
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
and uh what's
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
what's uh
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
is there any history on that in the
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
lottery or what's the understanding of
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
lottery on that question and then the
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
question the other question uh it was
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
asked by
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
others uh related to the commission and
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh the five percent versus eight percent
 
00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh the five percent versus eight percent
um

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
lottery retail scratch tickets versus uh
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
keno um that's what the answer was five
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
percent for scratch tickets and eight
 
00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.829 align:start position:0%
percent for scratch tickets and eight
percent

00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
for keno and we just i just like to have
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
that stuff confirmed yeah that's very
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
charlie yeah certainly thank you
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
chairman representative ames um
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
certainly we would respect the senior
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
town that voted to reverse it and we
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
would shut it off in that city or town
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
if they indeed did so um we would not
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
sell keno the town didn't didn't want it
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the answer to the first
 
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
so that's the answer to the first
question

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
second one is yes that's correct the
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
commission rate uh for kino is eight
 
00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
commission rate uh for kino is eight
percent

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
the commission rate for other lottery
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
sales is five percent but we have
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
certain bonuses and cashing bonuses and
 
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.190 align:start position:0%
certain bonuses and cashing bonuses and
uh

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
bonuses for selling winning tickets so
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
our actual commission rate is about five
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
point eight five point nine percent for
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
stores that sell lottery tickets it's
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
five percent plus it's the best way to
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
describe it
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh like for example if you sold a
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
winning powerball ticket
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
you get a check for seventy five
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so that's included in
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
okay
follow-up

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.589 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
good that's that's helpful um so can you
 
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.990 align:start position:0%
good that's that's helpful um so can you
uh

00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
what's the rationale what's
 
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.150 align:start position:0%
what's the rationale what's
that

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
what's your understanding of the reason
 
00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:18.790 align:start position:0%
what's your understanding of the reason
for

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
the higher rate for keno
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question that was
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually part of a community discussion
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
back when this was approved and it was
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
based around a higher commission rate
 
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
based around a higher commission rate
would

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
make adoption faster for bars and
 
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.510 align:start position:0%
make adoption faster for bars and
taverns

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
taverns
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
because it would be in essence the
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
lowest margin of product in a bar at
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
eight percent uh and
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
if it was lower than that adoption would
 
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.309 align:start position:0%
if it was lower than that adoption would
be

00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
slower and
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
you know less broad-based
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
is the eight percent based upon
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
the net or the gross
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question mr
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
chairman it's based on the gross and so
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
if you sell a dollar ticket you get
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
eight cents
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
and so and if i could add numbers to
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
that mr chairman the average keno
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
location today
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
sells about 670
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
per day per location so you're talking
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
they make about 50
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
a day
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
on average selling kino currently and
 
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's an average obviously you have
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
stores that sell or bars that sell much
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
names do you have any further questions
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
i do have one further follow-up question
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
charlie's response
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the rationale for the
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
higher rate related to bars and
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants and
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
their margins um
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so the question obvious question is
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
well what about the uh
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
places that the retail places that this
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
bill would add does that same rationale
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
hold for uh those establishments where
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets are
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
are currently authorized
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
it does representative so as kevin
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
daigle said um we've received this
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
request from a number of retailers
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
who actually live in jurisdictions that
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
approve kino who actually cash keto
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
tickets that can't sell it uh and so
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's a frustration amongst them
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
that they're cashing winning tickets for
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
products they can't sell
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate and so that's the one
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
of the rationales behind this request of
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the llb yeah
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
i have one major question but uh to
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
follow up on a couple of these so that
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
so when that when these stores uh when a
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
grocery store cashes out
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
they're getting what are they getting
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
five percent is that what you're saying
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
no they don't because they didn't sell
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
it they don't get anything for it all
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
they get is the fact that
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
in yours in that store
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
somebody is getting cash and hopefully
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
making a sale something else
 
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.670 align:start position:0%
making a sale something else
okay

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand that
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
but uh you had my introductory comment
 
00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:13.349 align:start position:0%
but uh you had my introductory comment
about

00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
the history of keno in massachusetts
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
and i used to call you mr kino because
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
you were involved so much of in getting
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
that going in in massachusetts
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
and you got to tell me if my
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
recollection of what was said when we
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
had the hearings
 
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.349 align:start position:0%
had the hearings
about

00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:29.359 --> 00:46:30.390 align:start position:0%
about
keno

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
keno
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
came to be in massachusetts but shortly
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
after it was occurred
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
i i used the term
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature recognized that there
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
was a mistake made that that having it
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
in heavy convenience store wasn't a good
 
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.589 align:start position:0%
in heavy convenience store wasn't a good
idea

00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if if i was a
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
convenience store now that wanted to do
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
implement you know they can't do it
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
because the law has changed in
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts am i correcting my
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
remembrance of all that
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
so you're partially correct
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative well it's better not
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
being correct at all so i'll take that
 
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.910 align:start position:0%
being correct at all so i'll take that
again

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
so what keto was passed in 93 in
 
00:47:10.079 --> 00:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
so what keto was passed in 93 in
massachusetts

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
it was actually at the direction of the
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislature the lottery nothing to do
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
this legislature who had inserted
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
funding and said lottery you will
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
start kino it will be by this date and
 
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
you will make this much money
 
00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
you will make this much money
um

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
and thereafter
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
there were some legislators and
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
elected officials in towns which are
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
very much against gambling
 
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.589 align:start position:0%
very much against gambling
who

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
were upset and so as part of a
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
negotiated settlement as it were
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
it was limited only to bars and taverns
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
in mass for a number of years
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
but there were still about 400 locations
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
in mass that had already been enabled to
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
sell keno in convenience stores
 
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.870 align:start position:0%
sell keno in convenience stores
thereafter

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
everyone realized you know this really
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem in stores and so it was
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
opened up to cities and towns across the
 
00:48:09.599 --> 00:48:11.190 align:start position:0%
opened up to cities and towns across the
state

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
certainly under the mass old technology
 
00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
it would have been almost impossible to
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
not sell keynote tickets in stores it
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
would have been an on or off switch as
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
it were
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
but we have the ability that bass didn't
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
have at the time to sort of geo-locate
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
keynote locations by towns and cities
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
that can approve it um so
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to explain
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
certainly mass politics but um it was
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
they wanted it all in
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
then they wanted only these bars and
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
taverns but they had grandfather they
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
had about 400 locations and so that's
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%

clarification

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:53.510 align:start position:0%

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.430 align:start position:0%
clarification
[Music]

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.309 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:57.270 align:start position:0%
so
again

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
going back to the debate we had several
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
years ago when we voted this in
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't think any of the members like
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that we had that we had the one
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
store that one gas station i forget what
 
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
store that one gas station i forget what
townington

00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
townington
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
run the border of the parking lots in
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but the gas station and
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
convenience store was in
 
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.230 align:start position:0%
convenience store was in
massachusetts

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
the concern of that is that they
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
stripped everything out of that
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
and we're just selling
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
keynote tickets well i would say
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you know we can remember the
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
internet store
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't want that that that was one of
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
bringing it to just the uh facilities
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
that poured liquor
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
am i correcting that that store still
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
exists in massachusetts yes the store is
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
called ted's mobile it's actually
 
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.470 align:start position:0%
called ted's mobile it's actually
methuen

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
methuen
 
00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.430 align:start position:0%
methuen
um

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
you're right the parking lot is in new
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the building is in
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but those are there's only
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of those of this
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
seven thousand locations in mass that
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
are licensed to sell keno
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think there's only in my memory this
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
old memory but in my memory my time
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
there there were only two locations like
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
that in the entire state
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
one is in
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
methuen the one you described and one is
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
in fall river it's called vista donuts
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um it's on the rhode island border
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
and they sell like 12 donuts a day and
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
nothing in aquino lottery tickets
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you charlie uh follow up again
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
charlie i i just want to make sure
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh when representative lang kind of
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
characterized your involvement with this
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
uh i'm assuming that lottery doesn't
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
take a position on this correct
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't certainly but i would i will
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
tell you certainly
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have received lots of commentary from
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
our retail network asking for this
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
um and that's not
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
a common thing for us we really have
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of commentary a lot of
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
requests to forward this as you know
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
we don't like to
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
support gambling expansion only because
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
we like to regulate it and operate it
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
and not be part of the
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
moving it forward
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
we also leave that to you folks to
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
decide that obviously the governor to
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
decide but um i will tell you that we've
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
received a significant number of
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
again follow-up follow up
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
so again and this is for the committee
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
too the
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
part of what we the reason we kept
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
limited to the bars
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
places the port liquor was the
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
aesthetics of it all
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
do we want keno
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
being played and you know i'm sure
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
there'd be a lot of people in in the
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
grocery store going grocery shopping
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
that don't want to see
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
keno being played there that was our
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
logic then
 
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:48.829 align:start position:0%
logic then
uh

00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
was i running out charlie i think that
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
was part of our logic then
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
it was and honestly to that extent
 
00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
if it's a business like a grocery store
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
it would be unlikely they would sell
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
keto it would be more likely that it'll
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
be a place like a sandwich shop that
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
would sell keto that has a breakfast and
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
lunch menu
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
where you would stop have a sandwich and
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
play keto a couple of times that they'd
 
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.270 align:start position:0%
play keto a couple of times that they'd
leave

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
kino sales as
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
you may know you can buy a ticket and
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
leave and check your numbers on the our
 
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.390 align:start position:0%
leave and check your numbers on the our
website

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:22.069 align:start position:0%
website
thereafter

00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you charlie on set
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the in the llb
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
i love you so sad
 
00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:31.030 align:start position:0%
i love you so sad
okay

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to testify for
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
just had a quick question on the um for
 
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.829 align:start position:0%
just had a quick question on the um for
mr

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
mr
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
mcintyre um
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
the on keno the um
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
the commission is eight percent could
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
you remind me what the state
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
percent is
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
sir certainly representative good
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
it varies slightly but it's
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 19 percent so every dollar
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
sold is about 19 profit uh this year
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
we'll net around 8.5 9 million dollars
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
in sales
 
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:11.190 align:start position:0%
in sales
um

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
covid was brutal for sales as you can
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
imagine but sales have been accelerating
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
the last couple of months so
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're averaging around 950 000 a week so
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
that'll yield us around 8.5 million
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
dollars for the year
 
00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:28.630 align:start position:0%
dollars for the year
follow-up

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
um what um and is it a similar
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
percentage to um general scratch tickets
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh good good questions uh representative
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
it depends on the scratch ticket so a
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
one dollar ticket it had pays out at 60
 
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:43.589 align:start position:0%
one dollar ticket it had pays out at 60
so

00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
every dollar you sell at a scratch
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
ticket's a dollar
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
the prize is 60
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
at a 20 ticket or 25 it's approximately
 
00:53:51.119 --> 00:53:52.309 align:start position:0%
at a 20 ticket or 25 it's approximately
80

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
80
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
and so the margin varies by scratch
 
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.150 align:start position:0%
and so the margin varies by scratch
ticket

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
similarly a scratch ticket so any
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
aggregate scratch tickets those are
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
around 20 profit margin
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman sorry i was trying to write
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and now oh yes enforcement
 
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.870 align:start position:0%
and now oh yes enforcement
on

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
how much more difficult is this going to
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
make it for
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
your enforcement if all the uh conv most
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
of the convenience stores are selling
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking i know you can do part
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the enforcement online but you cannot
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
tell on whether people are allowing
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i presume that this will have to be
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
added into your
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
controls that we haven't heard about yet
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
on that have on that are trying to
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
locate people that are over
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
over playing and spending beyond their
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh certainly when it comes to store by
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
store it's difficult to
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
limit sales as you can imagine it's the
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent of stopping somebody from
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
buying too much coffee if they go to
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
store to store the store to store we
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
can't stop that um
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
the stores are on their own to control
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
products like this that are age
 
00:55:24.549 --> 00:55:24.559 align:start position:0%
controlled similar to cigarettes similar
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
to beer um
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we have an enforcement division but
 
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.790 align:start position:0%
and we have an enforcement division but
it's

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the stores to control what they sell
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else wish to testify for or
 
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.309 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else wish to testify for or
against

00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 5 uh
 
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.950 align:start position:0%
house bill 5 uh
355

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
355
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
there are seven people that have signed
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
up and support
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
senator major
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
but um i just wanted to to point one
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
thing out to representative lang
 
00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.630 align:start position:0%
thing out to representative lang
um

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
if that's okay
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
the one sentence
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
really isn't grammatically fluent mate
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
and i know he was particular about
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
another bill 354 so maybe he wants to
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
look at that and fix it
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
representative you're still with us
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i heard it i'll re-read the
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill and see what it looks like again
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's what ols drafted but
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
if it needs some sort of amendment to
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
clean up language i'm happy to work with
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
someone on the committee to get an
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted before it's exact
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
i believe that it would be fluent if you
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
read the context it's just one of a
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
of groups that is allowed all the others
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
have liquor licenses that is allowed to
 
00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
have liquor licenses that is allowed to
to

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
to
sell

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
sell
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
say that again
 
00:57:08.319 --> 00:57:09.750 align:start position:0%
say that again
on

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
it this is not a complete sentence
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
number on lines three to five oh okay
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that yes
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad that representative camaro
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
asked that question
 
00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.549 align:start position:0%
asked that question
and

00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
so representative lying is going to take
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
a look at that
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
because if he doesn't
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%

a list of what all of these new places
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed to do it
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
on what those definitions from the
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code
 
01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.750 align:start position:0%
internal revenue code
cover

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
i started
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
i looked them up and on
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
i looked up c2 first and got this
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
lawyer's long just
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh discussion of how complicated c2 is
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
now c2 in general is
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a
 
01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.470 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a
educational

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
educational
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
facility of any particular kind that
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh c uh uh eight is a non uh is a
 
01:04:22.870 --> 01:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit fraternal benefit society
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
and c-10 is a large society
 
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.470 align:start position:0%
and c-10 is a large society
um

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
it would just include those names
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
without having to go up and set up a
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
separate uh
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
entity to engage in gaming there are
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
non-profits by def by because our
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
non-profit definition in the state of
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is so big you can drive a
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
semi through it
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
actually you could buy five of them
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
abreast through it
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
this just uh clarifies to a degree
 
01:04:55.119 --> 01:04:55.910 align:start position:0%
this just uh clarifies to a degree
uh

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
what the uh what entities are allowed
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
okay that um that's what worries me i
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
hope we can get a lawyer's disposition
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh discussion of this at some point
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
all right thank you ma'am
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative jennifer
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm wondering
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
whether this
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
my question's
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar to representative almis
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
does this mean that now churches for
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
instance would be
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
able to do charitable gaming
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh actually i think they're already
 
01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.630 align:start position:0%
uh actually i think they're already
allowed

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
represent hacking phillips
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see a raised hand but i see your
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
hands visually
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i lost i lost my ability to raise
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
my hand so thank you mr chair
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
um i do a fair amount of work in the
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector and um i can follow up
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
on some of the answers
 
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.069 align:start position:0%
on some of the answers
um

01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
so for instance 501 c 3s are tax
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
tax-exempt organizations that are
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
charitable in nature
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
medical organizations
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
of a certain kind
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
as well as educational
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
organizations so we're talking about
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
your traditional nonprofits under the
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
501c3 that you would think of
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
501 c2s are title holding companies um
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative ellery spoke to the
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
educational trust funds and i think that
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's one subsection of that category um
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
501c8s are lodges or fraternal
 
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.069 align:start position:0%
501c8s are lodges or fraternal
organizations

01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
and 501c10
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
are domestic fraternal societies orders
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
and associations under the lodge system
 
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.549 align:start position:0%
and associations under the lodge system
now

01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
my question is related to the ir
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
the inner
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
internal revenue codes classifications
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
for tax exempt organizations and my
 
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.309 align:start position:0%
for tax exempt organizations and my
question

01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
to representative ulri is what makes
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
these three new sub
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
groups special because that we know that
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
there are other non-exempt or tax-exempt
 
01:07:06.319 --> 01:07:07.750 align:start position:0%
there are other non-exempt or tax-exempt
organizations

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
that could also technically
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
be included if we are going to expand
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
the definition
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is why not c4s civic
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
leagues why not c5s agricultural groups
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
and labor organizations
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
why not c6
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce for instance or the
 
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.670 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce for instance or the
nfl

01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
nfl
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
why not c7
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
recreational clubs why not c9 voluntary
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
employment benefit associations
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
why not c10 teachers retirement fund
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
associations and why not c-12s the
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
benevolent life associations
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
very good i'd like the amendment that
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that anyone registered
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
with the irs under a 501c category thank
 
01:07:52.559 --> 01:07:53.349 align:start position:0%
with the irs under a 501c category thank
you

01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh well it wasn't my recommendation but
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
um my question
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
i smell on that question to you
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
why why are these sub groups more
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
special than the rest
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
why not be treating everyone the same
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
because i'm familiar with the ones i
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
listed and i'm not that familiar with an
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
um mr chair uh

uh president obama have a question uh
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
hold on a minute
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
end up
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
you see it was down that's why i chimed
 
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.950 align:start position:0%
you see it was down that's why i chimed
in

what is the definition of a raffle
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
how broad is that
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
well that's something we need to look up
 
01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.789 align:start position:0%
well that's something we need to look up
and

01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know is it i mean
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's what is the actual
 
01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:05.349 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's what is the actual
definition

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
i should have gone out of time but i
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
mean off the top of your head
 
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.510 align:start position:0%
mean off the top of your head
i

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
i've got another uh
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
bill coming up on uh expanding the uh
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
balance of that and that's within the
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
raffle definition but right now the
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
definition of a raffle is limited into a
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
mount uh and it's a ticket that is sold
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
to the public as opposed to a 50 50
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
which is sold within a closed
 
01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:36.149 align:start position:0%
which is sold within a closed
environment

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up i was going to ask if
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
5050 was included in this
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
no that's
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
generally since it's not 5050s are not
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
generally uh sold to the public but
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're you know uh you have a uh
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
a pta meeting and everyone within the
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
pta throws in there 50 cents and gets a
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
ticket and then they split it 50 50
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
whatever within the within a limited
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
group that is present then and there
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's not uh offered to the public
 
01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
it's not uh offered to the public
normally

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
normally
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so follow up so 5050 is not
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
included in this
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
right not included yeah thank you
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions in the from the
 
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.229 align:start position:0%
any further questions in the from the
llb

01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
all set in the lb well okay
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
i just i just raised my question to my
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
hand again
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay representatives
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry to go back and forth um
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
so um this amendment would
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
add three
 
01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.910 align:start position:0%
add three
501c

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
501c
 
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.189 align:start position:0%
501c
subsets

01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
subsets
 
01:10:49.199 --> 01:10:50.149 align:start position:0%
subsets
to

01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
the current 501c3 that's the way i
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.709 align:start position:0%
my question
is

01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
can you tell us offhand or
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
do we need to
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
flush it out ourselves
 
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
what restrictions
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
apply to 501c3s
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:11:10.159 --> 01:11:11.750 align:start position:0%
in terms of
activity

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
compliance with particular rules
 
01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:15.270 align:start position:0%
compliance with particular rules
whatever

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.390 align:start position:0%
whatever
uh

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
that do not apply to the other subsets
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that uh this bill would add
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh to this
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
to the list of uh
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
entities authorized to
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
take part in these other charitable
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
gaming activities
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh i'm really that that's a question
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
that someone in your profession uh would
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
better answer the irs classification c
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.679 --> 01:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
distinctions

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
distinctions
 
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
distinctions
of

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
purpose and activity in which the entity
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
is engaged
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
for example the knights of columbus the
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
knights of pythius sell insurance to the
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
foresters uh sell insurance
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
to their members
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
therefore their 501c8
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
the masons is a large organization
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're set up as 501 c 10s uh from my
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
understanding on discussing uh this with
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
the the attack of the
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys that i deal with
 
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.669 align:start position:0%
attorneys that i deal with
um

01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the knights of columbus it's very
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
simple to
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
is only a
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
administrative division of charitable
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
organizations but they're not being
 
01:12:41.669 --> 01:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
called charities also uh contributions
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
to the knights or to the masons are not
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
themselves deductible as a tax entity
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
whereas uh
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
contributions to 501c3
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
are tax deductible it's you know it's
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.070 align:start position:0%
it's it's
into

01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.470 align:start position:0%
into
um

01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
the weeds on law and that but uh
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
as far as i i understand it it's there's
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
just subtle differences like that 501 c
 
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:07.990 align:start position:0%
just subtle differences like that 501 c
2

01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
2
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative hocken phillips just said
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
educational with uh
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of subsections that goes on for
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
pages and pages and pages but
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity by putting 501 c2s in
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
there was to
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
allow schools to do these things
 
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.990 align:start position:0%
allow schools to do these things
directly

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
directly
 
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.189 align:start position:0%
directly
and

01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
the others to do them directly as well
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
one thing that has come out of this
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
testimony so far is that if we were to
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
strike all of those and just say
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
registered with the irs is a 501c entity
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that would cover
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
any existing in any future uh
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit organizations that are
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
registered with the irs but not
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily registered with the
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
thought

01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well i think this is an important
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
question we need to know for sure what
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
the uh restrictions uh
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
are that apply to these different
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
subsets because uh we need to go into
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
this with our eyes open um and uh i i
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
guess i'm going to
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
say that we
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
i want i want to have a uh
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i'll work on it myself if nobody
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
else will uh but maybe representative
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
hack and phillips can help
 
01:14:28.870 --> 01:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
to get a full full explanation of the
 
01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
to get a full full explanation of the
differences

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
differences
um

01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
as we jump from
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
just one subset of 501c to
 
01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.950 align:start position:0%
just one subset of 501c to
four

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
excellent questions
 
01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
excellent questions
uh

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:14:47.990 --> 01:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative ames
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
i am thank you
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh uh taking my question i
 
01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.229 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh uh taking my question i
uh

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:00.239 --> 01:15:01.110 align:start position:0%
uh
i'm

01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
curious to know if
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
when uh we capture all those uh
 
01:15:05.199 --> 01:15:06.709 align:start position:0%
when uh we capture all those uh
nonprofits

01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
nonprofits
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh this may not be relevant but do any
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
of those include political organizations
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
that raise money for the purpose of
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
lobbying um
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
i just don't know and and i was just
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
curious if that
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
scoops up
 
01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the uh that kind of thing too thank you
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh uh representative
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
malloy and yes you're correct uh i
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the list is is long and
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
extensive on that and i agree with the
 
01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative aims that a short uh
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
break to discuss all of the 501 c
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
bs would be
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh very appropriate
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
and yes uh a political entity is
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
included as a 501c not
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
non-tax entity i had forgotten about
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair yeah i do think that
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
there are certain regulations related to
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
some political and lobbying activities
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
for any of these charitable
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
organizations um i think the threshold
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
is about 18
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
of their income
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
can be allocated to those activities
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
without losing their tax exempt status
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
so i think you might run the risk of um
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
well if if the organizations aren't
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
careful in monitoring that
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
activity and raffles become
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
a political and some nature that they
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
could be running the risk of losing
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
their status it's just
 
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.990 align:start position:0%
their status it's just
um

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's dependent upon the activity itself
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
so i think this becomes a real gray area
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
and you know definitely further
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
discussion about this would be helpful i
 
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
discussion about this would be helpful i
think

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
would you say that again please
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
sure i mean so 501c organizations that
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
fall under the category of c3 are
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
limited to how much
 
01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
activity they can allocate their income
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
towards that may be political or
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
lobbying in nature
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
before they're in um danger of losing
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
their tax-exempt status
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
so um you know
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not a raffle could qualify as
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
an activity as political or lobbying
 
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.790 align:start position:0%
an activity as political or lobbying
could

01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
you know affect their status but in
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to raffle i don't
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
would have any significance but it's
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
worth that you know diving in deeper to
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
find out
 
01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
um you know how raffle might qualify as
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
political or or a lobbying activity
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
any response to that reps in your league
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
no i i agree that uh uh
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
thankful for in
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
that the discussion thus far has
 
01:17:59.830 --> 01:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
brought out some issues that uh
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys uh like to pull out but uh
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank the
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
members for uh bringing those out and uh
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
feel that we should discuss this a
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
little bit further that's fine i would
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee on addressing those
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's best to pull them out now rather
 
01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.790 align:start position:0%
it's best to pull them out now rather
than

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
get clobbered late later
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
i want to just raise the issue of
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement of
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
raffles i presume that we have raffles
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
in our law because there were a bunch of
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous people in the past that
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
on raised money saying that on
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to win a
 
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.590 align:start position:0%
you're going to win a
chevrolet

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
chevrolet
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
impala or something like that
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
and then there was no chevrolet impala
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
or nobody ever won
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
except the guy that had the raffle
 
01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.709 align:start position:0%
except the guy that had the raffle
and

01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
so there must be some
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
some method of enforcement which i'm
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
afraid would just be the ag's office and
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is so overworked that it doesn't
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
do any consumer enforcement usually
 
01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.830 align:start position:0%
do any consumer enforcement usually
um

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering on what
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
expanding whether they would be uh
 
01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
expanding whether they would be uh
upset

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
upset
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
at being handed more of this or not
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
um whether we want to take a look at
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
whether we need some other kind of
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement for raffles if we're going
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
to expand it or even if we leave it the
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:48.229 --> 01:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative welmy already the
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
raffle is pretty well controlled by
 
01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.990 align:start position:0%
raffle is pretty well controlled by
lottery

01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
they they monitor these things we
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
require separate checkbooks uh
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
have people going out and checking the
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
checkbooks now and again i'm familiar
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
with organizations that do bingo and
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
such like activities i don't think this
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
would be an expansion of the enforcement
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
effort as for how the laws came into
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
effect i don't think it was a chevrolet
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
impala i think it was a herd of goats
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
was the first raffle or something like
 
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:21.830 align:start position:0%
was the first raffle or something like
that

01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a human activity of
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh trying to make money off of some
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
other people or or have a good social
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
time um
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
at a dinner dance or something like that
 
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
at a dinner dance or something like that
to

01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
raise money for a good cause i know
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
some raffles with limited ticket sales
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
provide scholarships for uh students uh
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
that provide uh aid for uh
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh dependent children uh eight for unwed

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
the i think that representative hillary
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
is talking about lottery overseeing
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
these in bingo games and things like
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
that the first uh raffle
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
on after i came back to this country
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
that i saw on in the market day of
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
hanover on was a group that seemed that
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
didn't deal with it
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
apparently was picking up
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
on names of people to use for some other
 
01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:29.910 align:start position:0%
on names of people to use for some other
purpose

01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
on and raffling something off in a booth
 
01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.430 align:start position:0%
on and raffling something off in a booth
fair

01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
and they did not appear the next time i
 
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
think hanover closed them down but on
 
01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:40.390 align:start position:0%
think hanover closed them down but on
the

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
i was on
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
if we open it up like this on
 
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
if we open it up like this on
we

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
we do run the risk of going back to that
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
of raffle and
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that we could follow this
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
up with the
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
lottery as well as the ag's office do
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
they really go
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
have any control over any lotteries
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
other than the one i mean uh raffles and
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
other than the ones that uh
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
are attached to charitable gaming
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
let me say something now
 
01:23:19.990 --> 01:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't going to pass as is
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
normally if we were in
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
regular session
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
put this bill into a subcommittee
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
to be worked on because it needs
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
a lot more answers
 
01:23:34.639 --> 01:23:35.669 align:start position:0%
a lot more answers
well

01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're operating in a different
 
01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.870 align:start position:0%
we're operating in a different
environment

01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be taking
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a work session on
 
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
the bill and determine
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
are we going to retain it are we going
 
01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.270 align:start position:0%
are we going to retain it are we going
to

01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
try to get amendments that would satisfy
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
all of our questions
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
or not so
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
we will have a work session so
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
we can get some of those answers at that
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have one other hand that i see raised
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to go to the blue
 
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to go to the blue
sheet

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%

01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
that the words charitable gaming banted
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
around a little bit in this conversation
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
we do have some other legislation we'll
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
be considering today this in no way
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
shape or form
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh expands charitable gaming this is
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh raffles
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%

01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
and confirm that with uh with the
 
01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.390 align:start position:0%

sponsor

01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%

any comments from the sponsor
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
no that's that was the the uh idea
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%

01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
hi i just wanted to clarify that um the
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
lottery does not regulate raffles it is
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
regulated by the city or town in which
 
01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
the raffle is being drawn
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
we do have raffles that can be sold at
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
bingo but again we don't regulate those
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
raffles they're just allowed at the
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
bingo game thank you
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh the thing that's surprising to me is
 
01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:34.470 align:start position:0%
uh the thing that's surprising to me is
that

01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking you know the title of bill
 
01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.270 align:start position:0%
we're talking you know the title of bill
is

01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
fraternal organization
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
you know i would think that photographer
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
organizations do raffles already
 
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.189 align:start position:0%
organizations do raffles already
but

01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm wrong
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh i guess the question is are are
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
are there total organizations now that
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
are doing raffles not knowing that it's
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's not in the statutes for them to do
 
01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.070 align:start position:0%
it's not in the statutes for them to do
that

01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's for the sponsor
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's my feeling too so we're going to
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
make honest people with everybody if we
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
if we bless this
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh more honest than they are as far as i
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
know uh raffles that are run by some of
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
the entities are
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
already approved by the town in which
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
the drawing takes place and that is in
 
01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.239 --> 01:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
statue

01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
statue
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
i i i not it's not clear area for me
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
which is one of the uh
 
01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.110 align:start position:0%
which is one of the uh
executive

01:26:35.110 --> 01:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that's helpful because we're trying
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.229 align:start position:0%

what's what's wrong with these codes
 
01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:38.229 align:start position:0%

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
ah

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
are we delaying starting again
 
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.790 align:start position:0%

okay
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
so i had a phone call for four of those
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to unmute myself
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay i guess we can start the public
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 565.
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%

to study charitable gaming
 
01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:34.719 align:start position:0%
and this is uh crime sponsors
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative ames i want to introduce
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
so it's my privilege to
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
introduce for consideration by this
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
committee house bill 565.
 
01:33:51.679 --> 01:33:54.149 align:start position:0%
committee house bill 565.
um

01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
i should i think i'll start with uh with
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
this that
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is sponsored by democrats i
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
regret that it's only democrats i
 
01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
thought that it would be otherwise
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
and expected that there would be
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
republican participation on this it was
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
certainly developed as a bipartisan bill
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i hope it will be
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
seen as such and dealt with as such as
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
we go forward
 
01:34:19.199 --> 01:34:20.149 align:start position:0%
we go forward
and

01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
let's hope so
 
01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.350 align:start position:0%
let's hope so
okay

01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to run through a quick sketch
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
and then give you some history
 
01:34:36.719 --> 01:34:39.030 align:start position:0%
and then give you some history
uh

01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
from which it springs and uh
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
and uh then talk about what we might do
 
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
with it um
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the bill itself
 
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
calls for setting up a
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
study committee a legislative study
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee with three house members and
 
01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
committee with three house members and
two

01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
senate members
 
01:34:58.239 --> 01:34:59.189 align:start position:0%
senate members
um

01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the focus of the
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
work of this committee would be
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh is all spelled out there starting at
 
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.030 align:start position:0%
uh is all spelled out there starting at
line

01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
11 and ending at line
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
24 of the bill
 
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:12.709 align:start position:0%
24 of the bill
um

01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
four important
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
issues would be addressed
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
first would be looking at the oversight
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
and enforcement of charitable gaming in
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
and how
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
the regulatory structure that we have
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
including staffing levels
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
compares with best practice
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory standards for the gaming
 
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.830 align:start position:0%
regulatory standards for the gaming
industry

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and to regulatory structures used in
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions the second
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
duty of the committee would be to review
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of prior study
 
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.390 align:start position:0%
the recommendations of prior study
commissions

01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
with respect to the regulatory structure
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
of charitable gaming
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
and uh look at
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
how well or badly the recommendations
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
coming out of those prior study
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
commissions have been addressed
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the third category looks at the
 
01:36:04.159 --> 01:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
and the third category looks at the
revenues

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
generated by
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators in the state
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the check and the amount distributed
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
to charities
 
01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
served by that operator
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
including cost considerations
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
duty of this commission
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
is to study the selection look at the
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
selection of charities by charitable
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
gaming operators
 
01:36:31.679 --> 01:36:33.990 align:start position:0%
gaming operators
um

01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
and uh so that's the that's the focus of
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
the this proposed study
 
01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.709 align:start position:0%
the this proposed study
um

01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
and the report the other important
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
point is that the report of the
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
committee if we were to go forward with
 
01:36:46.719 --> 01:36:47.750 align:start position:0%
committee if we were to go forward with
this

01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
would be due honor before november
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay so a little bit of history i think
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
might be helpful
 
01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.750 align:start position:0%
might be helpful
um

01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
back when i first entered the
 
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2012
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
i very quickly got involved because i
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
was a member of this committee committee
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
massive effort to develop a uh
 
01:37:22.719 --> 01:37:24.709 align:start position:0%
massive effort to develop a uh
a

01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
super large casino
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and uh
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that activity led to my appointment
 
01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.629 align:start position:0%
and that activity led to my appointment
to

01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
serve as chair of
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
a new new hampshire gaming regulatory
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
commission in
 
01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.669 align:start position:0%
commission in
2013.

01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
did did work it was funded
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
at a consultant and
 
01:37:49.679 --> 01:37:51.270 align:start position:0%
at a consultant and
developed

01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
developed
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
a very lengthy detailed report and two
 
01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
a very lengthy detailed report and two
bills

01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
one of which was for expanded gaming
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
which would be the casino
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the other bill
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
was for reform
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
in charitable gaming
 
01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.950 align:start position:0%
in charitable gaming
the

01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.790 align:start position:0%
the
bills

01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
were put into the hopper in
 
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.430 align:start position:0%
were put into the hopper in
2014

01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
2014
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
and the expanded gaming bill
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
failed in the house by one vote if i
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
remember correctly
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
a close call and the
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
other bill on expanded charitable gaming
 
01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.910 align:start position:0%
other bill on expanded charitable gaming
passed

01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
both bodies and was enacted into the law
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
with essentially no change from
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
the form that it
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
took uh coming out of the
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
this gaming commission
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
and that is what we now have
 
01:38:46.239 --> 01:38:49.510 align:start position:0%
and that is what we now have
in

01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
284 a
 
01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
284 a
rsa284a

01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
rsa284a
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
is essentially what was put into
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
law as a product of this work of course
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's been demanded a little bit
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh betting limits uh
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
for form certain forms of gambling have
 
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:06.229 align:start position:0%
for form certain forms of gambling have
been

01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh raised and a few changes have been
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
made but essentially is the same there
 
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
was one more big change that was made
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
in uh i think it was 2015 and in the
 
01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:20.310 align:start position:0%
in uh i think it was 2015 and in the
budget

01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that was to
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
bring under the bring into the lottery
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
commission the duties of what was then
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh before that
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
a separate entity the racing and
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming commission
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
so uh lottery took over those functions
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
and took over the duties and
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
and task of implementing overseeing
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
doing was called for by this
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
new 284
 
01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.669 align:start position:0%
new 284
a

01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
so that's the background
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
it was a massive effort to perform to
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
enhan enhance oversight
 
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
enhan enhance oversight
of

01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming it included provisions
 
01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.310 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming it included provisions
that

01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
sort of the black market game gaming in
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and enhanced
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
the powers of the attorney general
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
as well as of lottery with respect to
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
those activities in fact one of the
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
bills that we have this year
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
the other number is uh
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
i i can't pull it up i guess uh
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
one of one of our pending bills
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh would create a division of
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement within the lottery it's sort
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
of consistent with this
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
this uh effort that i'm describing
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
so uh why go forward with this bill now
 
01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.990 align:start position:0%
so uh why go forward with this bill now
um

01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
my my thoughts about it are that
 
01:40:47.590 --> 01:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
years have passed since that
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
major change in structure and
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
scope of regulatory activity
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
nature of uh regulation and so forth
 
01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.070 align:start position:0%
nature of uh regulation and so forth
um

01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.470 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
time has gone by since that was enacted
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's isn't that time to take a look at
 
01:41:03.679 --> 01:41:04.390 align:start position:0%
it's isn't that time to take a look at
it

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
and see how it's doing whether it's
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
sufficient or
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
should be modified and i i think that
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
should be done
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
particularly since we're seeing
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
interest in expanding charitable gaming
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
let's be sure that we've got a structure
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
and oversight system that ensures that
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
gambling in new hampshire which
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
history tells us can couldn't can can go
 
01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:34.550 align:start position:0%
history tells us can couldn't can can go
wrong

01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh it goes right as we go forward
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
um that's my motivation for
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
refiling it i guess another motivation
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
is that i was deeply involved in this
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
at that time and helped to create this
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
thing and uh you know i'm not going to
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
be around forever so i'd uh i'd like to
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
see uh
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
have some assurance that we're going
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
down the right path and not the wrong
 
01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.629 align:start position:0%
down the right path and not the wrong
path

01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
path
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh
 
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
going forward with this bill
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to do this i
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
think it's really important
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
but it's got to be done with
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
with conviction and by
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
with the participation of both parties
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
gambling and oversight of gambling
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
in my experience in this legislature has
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
been bipartisan that fight over the
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
expanded gaming
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
was very much a fight that mixed up
 
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
parties i got to know a whole lot of
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
people that i wouldn't have gotten to
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
know really well
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
as i came down on the side of pushing
 
01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
for expanded gaming
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
and i uh
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
really appreciated the relationships
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
grew out of that
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
and so uh if we're going to go forward
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
with this committee
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
um i know it's hard to do this kind of
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
thing in the time of cobin but uh
 
01:42:58.629 --> 01:42:58.639 align:start position:0%
maybe uh
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
we can find a way of doing it i hope we
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
can go forward with it and uh so i'll
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
leave it that leave it at that
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair would you mind if i
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
chimed in first uh president brownie
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative romney
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames uh
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
so you know there's a companion bill
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
over in the senate you may be aware of
 
01:43:23.189 --> 01:43:23.199 align:start position:0%
that very similar bill
 
01:43:24.629 --> 01:43:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh senator dallas
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
seinfeld actually reached out to me and
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
asked if i sent out as a sponsor or
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor which i did
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
if i don't know if you would email me i
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
would have certainly signed on as a
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor in this bill so
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's definitely bipartisan uh support
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
for continue review
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
the study that you talked about from
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
it was a commission then um i'm assuming
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the same one
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
it was a senate bill though uh that i
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
think created it
 
01:43:55.119 --> 01:43:58.310 align:start position:0%
think created it
um

01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah dick you want to respond to that i
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
think it was a thing yeah i didn't hear
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
a word you said it
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:08.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:44:08.790 --> 01:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a similar bill over in
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
the senate right now
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah you aware of that
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so i i i think they do the
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh obviously we'll we'll merge the bills
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
together i'm a co-sponsor of that bill
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
senator alessandro had reached out to me
 
01:44:30.790 --> 01:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
oh uh we'll definitely be bipartisan
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this uh i would have signed on this
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
bill i didn't i didn't even know this
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill was being filed
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
but i was also involved in the
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
commission it was five or six years ago
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just wondering if that that
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
was the same committee it was a it
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't a committee it wasn't a joint
 
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.709 align:start position:0%
wasn't a committee it wasn't a joint
committee

01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
it was a commission that included uh
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
others uh remember there was state
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
police was on it there was somebody from
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
the ag's office on it
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh that we
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's the commission that uh
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about from years ago
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
that you were incorporating in the bill
 
01:45:04.159 --> 01:45:05.109 align:start position:0%
that you were incorporating in the bill
here

01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh for us to review and to update uh
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
some of those recommendations from them
 
01:45:10.719 --> 01:45:11.510 align:start position:0%
some of those recommendations from them
uh

01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
clearly then the only thing i'll point
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
out to the committee
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh that then and i think representative
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
ames mentioned this then it was under
 
01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:22.550 align:start position:0%
ames mentioned this then it was under
the

01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
auspices of
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
of uh the gerald gaming commission they
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
had their own commission and a few years
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
ago we wrapped that into that commission
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
went away
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
and so charitable gaming is now under
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
the auspices of lottery
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and uh i think lottery
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh was a better place for it to be
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
so but i don't want to give background i
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
was involved uh so as we we worked this
 
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.590 align:start position:0%
was involved uh so as we we worked this
bill

01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'm in full support of it dick uh
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't hurt
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure we we had our concerns back
 
01:45:57.679 --> 01:45:58.950 align:start position:0%
to ensure we we had our concerns back
then

01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh about about the oversight
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh and i think it's time i agree i think
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's time to take another look
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
at how we're doing now that lottery is
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
in control of it
 
01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.270 align:start position:0%
in control of it
so

01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that was good to hear um
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i would just say that regarding
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
the history
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
i think there may have been two
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
commissions um
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
the commission that uh i was referring
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
to was uh
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
a funded commission and it
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
it had had the directive lottery on it
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney general was on it
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
personally as a matter of fact the
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
crafters of that bill for some reason
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
didn't allow him to designate anyone
 
01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
didn't allow him to designate anyone
so

01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney general was on there
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
personally the lottery director was on
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
there the commissioner of public safety
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
was on there senator rausch republican
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
senator roush was
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
was an active participant i worked
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
closely with him
 
01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:00.229 align:start position:0%
closely with him
and

01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
there were others
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
a very very good hard-working commission
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
and i do think and this is another
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
reason why we should
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
should do this uh that there was a
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
separate an additional effort looking at
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming that came a year or
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
two later
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that's yes you're correct that's
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
the commission i'm talking about that
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
was focused just on charitable gain
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess i'm very familiar with
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
the commission you were on and then
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was another one that was was the
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill that created it
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i i was picked and i was the two
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
legislators on that with me uh from the
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
house and senator alessandro from the
 
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.830 align:start position:0%
house and senator alessandro from the
senate

01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and that we should access that
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
report if this passes
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
we should see what that report said
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
going you know way back
 
01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:00.629 align:start position:0%
going you know way back
great

01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh before we go to any cr any questions
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
i just do have one question
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
on the membership
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
is why is it
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know i think five would be better
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative major um
 
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.070 align:start position:0%
representative major um
[Music]

01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
three makes choosing difficult and uh
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
and five uh maybe we could reach out to
 
01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
and five uh maybe we could reach out to
uh

01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
people outside of the ways and means
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
committee it was just three
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
so you wouldn't have any problem expect
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
i would have no problem going to five
 
01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:51.830 align:start position:0%
i would have no problem going to five
representative

01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair

thank you for bringing that forward
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's i i was uh unaware that
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
existed and
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work with uh
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
with representative ames
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
yes i just wanted to say that that was
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
enormously useful to hear the history
 
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:18.870 align:start position:0%
enormously useful to hear the history
um

01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
seeing the bill by itself uh when i read
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
it over i didn't understand the
 
01:49:23.119 --> 01:49:24.310 align:start position:0%
it over i didn't understand the
background

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i do think bipartisanship on this
 
01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:29.030 align:start position:0%
and i do think bipartisanship on this
essential

01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
essential
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
and i think your explanation
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
made it highly more likely
 
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.350 align:start position:0%
made it highly more likely
i

01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
although i understand the senate
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
is apparently
 
01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
considering such a bill it sounds like
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
they are going to be much more under the
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
gun to
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
roll up their bills into sort of
 
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.470 align:start position:0%
roll up their bills into sort of
uh

01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
conglomerations and i hope you
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
continue to keep this going
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what you believe right
 
01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.350 align:start position:0%
and that's what you believe right
representative

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.590 align:start position:0%
representative
means

01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:50:11.199 --> 01:50:12.709 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative ames i was just wondering
 
01:50:14.639 --> 01:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
representative ames i was just wondering
um

01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
is it currently true that charitable
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators have
 
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
complete control over who they choose as
 
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.550 align:start position:0%
complete control over who they choose as
charities

01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:27.669 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:50:27.669 --> 01:50:27.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i i think
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discretion
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
given to the
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
gaming operators and
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
not much in the way of uh limitations
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
but you know that's one of the things
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's it's exactly one of the things
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to to look closely at exactly
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.310 --> 01:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm going to be answering i'm 900
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
sure but uh
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
i know that uh
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
charlie's going to be here for the one
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock hearing on the historic racing
 
01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:04.310 align:start position:0%
o'clock hearing on the historic racing
bill

01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a good time to ask that
 
01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:06.870 align:start position:0%
and that's a good time to ask that
question

01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:51:09.109 --> 01:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh in that bill we're going to expand
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
the number of charities that are going
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to participate because
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's a very long list of charities
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
that want to get involved right now
 
01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.189 align:start position:0%
that want to get involved right now
so

01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
but that'll be this afternoon but
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
charlie will be there the whole meeting
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to respond to
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
that as somebody who's actually been on
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
a non-profit fundraising committee
 
01:51:38.550 --> 01:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
i used to run nonprofits and had to
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
actually do this
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
their every
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming location has you fill
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
out an application
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
and then they tell you what dates you
 
01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
and then they tell you what dates you
have

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
you only get 10 dates in a year in a
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
and they do not let you pick your dates
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
they do tell you so i do believe it's
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
actually quite selective but yes um
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
i believe that um director mcintyre
 
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be obviously expert but
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
um if you have any questions i'm happy
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
to tell you from a outsider's
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i'm a co-sponsor so i'm just
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
hoping to be able to say something as
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
testimony after everybody else's talk
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh actually i just wanted
 
01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh actually i just wanted
to

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
to point out that the senate has said
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
that it's not doing
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh i think openly that they're not doing
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
study committees this year at all and
 
01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
study committees this year at all and
that

01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
the house i believe the speaker had
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
indicated that we shouldn't be doing
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
them either
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i was thinking that this might go
 
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.510 align:start position:0%
and i was thinking that this might go
into

01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:08.310 align:start position:0%
into
uh

01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
retention but
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
it is so um
 
01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
on all embracing that except for it
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the uh treatment for
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
problem gamblers how that's working and
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's subject i'd love to know more
 
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.310 align:start position:0%
that's subject i'd love to know more
about

01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:28.550 align:start position:0%
about
on

01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
i wonder if representative ames would be
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh would think that it could be done in
 
01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.510 align:start position:0%
uh would think that it could be done in
retention

01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
retention
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
or if the chair can say something about
 
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:44.790 align:start position:0%
or if the chair can say something about
it

01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
this is important
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason we can't do it
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
if we're doing public hearings and
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
 
01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:54.550 align:start position:0%
executive sessions
on

01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:56.310 align:start position:0%
on
virtually

01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
virtually
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
we can do this directly
 
01:53:59.599 --> 01:54:01.109 align:start position:0%
we can do this directly
okay

01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
so could we do it as a retained bill
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
because if we send it over to the senate
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
i think it gets
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
killed it may end up being a retained
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
bill but let's
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a work session first
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
so let's think about it
 
01:54:16.239 --> 01:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
so let's think about it
and

01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
what's the best way of addressing that
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
in this environment
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair if you don't mind me and uh
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative romney if the senate says
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do care uh
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
commissions the next or even joint
 
01:54:29.599 --> 01:54:30.709 align:start position:0%
commissions the next or even joint
committees

01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:54:32.149 --> 01:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
then we can make this bill uh just a a
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
committee of the house
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then we have to worry about the
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
senate but we prefer to have the
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
senators involved but
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
that's one optional term
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
i can make an ad hoc committee
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but yeah because as a bill it would
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
so you got a little support
 
01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:03.270 align:start position:0%
so you got a little support
[Laughter]

01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh would you believe uh
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative ames that in that uh
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative gorg's uh statement
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
there is accurate and uh important to uh
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
what she said about the uh the the
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
non-profits and her analysis of how you
 
01:55:28.070 --> 01:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
apply for that and the to be a
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit to be on the list of
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's what you believe representative
 
01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:39.910 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
am i supposed to respond to that well
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
my my point is that's a very important
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
part of this and i would ask you
 
01:55:48.159 --> 01:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
part of this and i would ask you
uh

01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:52.950 --> 01:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
would we concentrate on that issue of
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
how these charities
 
01:55:56.709 --> 01:55:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh apply
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
to get in line
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%

it's not the only issue and the other
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
issues i've sketched out there sketched
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
out in this legislation so
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%

um absolutely this needs to be looked at
um

01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%

01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
continually held sporting event in
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
america having been run continuously
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
since 1875.
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
that'll be 146 years uh this coming may
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
churchill downs is more than a famous
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
racetrack however churchill downs is a
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
publicly traded company operating 10
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
gaming facilities in nine states
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
these are clean modern facilities
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
featuring electronic and table gaming
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
the same types of games we see in new
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire's casinos
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'll actually be testifying later today
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
on your one o'clock bill on historic
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
racing but i thought i would comment on
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
this bill as well
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
churchill downs knows that a strong
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment is important to
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
the entire gaming community
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
if something goes awry at one facility
 
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
it affects public confidence statewide
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
and perhaps nationwide this is even more
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
important with charitable gaming because
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
people want to be sure the money is
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
going to the charities and not sneaking
 
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
out the back door
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing on representative
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
abrami's bill to create a new division
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
of investigation and compliance
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
rick newman stated the number one item
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
of importance in any gambling operation
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
is integrity churchill downs agrees with
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
that statement
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
you talked
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the provision of the
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
bill that asks to review recommendations
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
of prior study committees as i looked
 
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
through the legislature's archives of
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
study committees um i found a couple of
 
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
reports both of which representative
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
ames and romney have mentioned two
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
separate reports one was the final
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
report of the gaming regulatory
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
oversight committee from 2013 that's the
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
one that representative ames chaired
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i urge committee members if you
 
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
get a chance pull down those reports and
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
take a look at them there they're
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
eye-opening uh in the 2013 report on
 
01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.109 align:start position:0%
eye-opening uh in the 2013 report on
pages

01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
36-39 refers to quote significant
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the existing charitable
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
gaming regulatory system
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
it notes that the state only has three
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
field investigators these are the people
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
who watch the games and the back office
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
operations to make sure the games and
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
the facilities are running compliance
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
with state regulations and thus
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
make sure the charities receive all that
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
is due them
 
01:59:14.229 --> 01:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
that report says there's three field
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
investigators to watch over over close
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
to 300 gambling tables in 12 locations
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
across the state from berlin to the
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
seacoast to the connecticut river in
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
addition to 300 bingo and lucky seven
 
01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.310 align:start position:0%
addition to 300 bingo and lucky seven
licensees

01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
three people to do that the 2013 report
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
calls that a significant deficiency
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
then there was a 2015 report the one
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
that which uh representative abrami sat
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
on the final report of the games for
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
charity study committee and these are
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
all happening back in the days i was
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
hanging around the senate too by the way
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
i apologize for any bad behavior with
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
the senate with respect to study
 
01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:50.470 align:start position:0%
the senate with respect to study
committees

01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
um my past sins
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
that 2015 report contains repeated
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
warnings about the lack of staff to
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
oversee charitable gaming activity in
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
it notes that two years after the prior
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
report we're pointing out there's only
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
three field investigators to cover the
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
entire state there is still only three
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
field investigators to cover the entire
 
02:00:11.599 --> 02:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
field investigators to cover the entire
state

02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from that 2015 report
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
was to bring on three more full-time
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
field investigators and a dozen or more
 
02:00:22.709 --> 02:00:22.719 align:start position:0%
part-timers you know as you know these
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
facilities they're open late in the
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
evening they're open on weekends they're
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
open on holidays uh and in this type of
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
situation a locally based part-timer is
 
02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
probably more
 
02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
probably more
than

02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
full-timers traveling across the state
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
and spending all their time in cars
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
i checked and in november of 2020 so
 
02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
five years after this report and seven
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
years after the first report we still
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
only have three full-time field
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
inspectors plus they did add one
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
part-time and they made one a supervisor
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
but only three full-time field
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
inspectors and one part-timer five years
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
after it was
 
02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679 align:start position:0%
cited as a significant deficiency
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
back then i'm going to guess the total
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
amount of money bet um
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
terrible gaming operations and table
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
games and such was probably around 200
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars at one o'clock you're
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to hear a bill that will add at
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
least according to last year's fiscal
 
02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:17.310 align:start position:0%
least according to last year's fiscal
note

02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
550 million dollars of cash flowing into
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
a system
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
of 750 million dollars three times what
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
it was in 2015 when we decided for not
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
having enough people to keep an eye on
 
02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.030 align:start position:0%
having enough people to keep an eye on
things

02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
um the report states that terrible
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
gaming is a system that can quote if
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
left unattended serve the charities less
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
and private interests more
 
02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
it says quote charities are at the mercy
 
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
of those individuals into whose hands
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
the charity has entrusted their gaming
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
receipts often with poor results for the
 
02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:52.470 align:start position:0%
receipts often with poor results for the
charity

02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
charity
 
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
and it closes with this recommendation
 
02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
before any discussion of expanding
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming there must be a commit
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
commitment by the state to adequately
 
02:02:03.910 --> 02:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
fund the positions necessary for
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
oversight and enforcement to ensure the
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
integrity of the games and to preserve
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
the very important resources resources
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
the charities that the system provides
 
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
the report mentions of audit of the
 
02:02:20.950 --> 02:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
coaching valley humane society a 2013
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
audit discovered that in a one year
 
02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:23.430 align:start position:0%
audit discovered that in a one year
period

02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars of proceeds were
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
unaccounted for
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
plus there was ninety thousand dollars
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
of unapproved and unreported free play
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
awarded and twenty thousand dollars of
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
questionable expenses
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's a hundred and thirty thousand
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
dollars of potentially missing proceeds
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
for a charity in a one-year period
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's more than twice the amount of
 
02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
money the charity actually received
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
for the operations
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
so again i suggest these prior reports
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
will provide good background reading for
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee members and in closing i
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
repeat churchill downs supports a strong
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment a strong
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory environment increases public
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
trust and more importantly ensures that
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
money is supposed to be go that is
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be going to charities is
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
indeed going to the charities and not
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
slipping out the back door for that
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
reason churchill down supports hb 565
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
and urges an ought to pass
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation i thank you for your time
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions you
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:30.629 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
bragdon for your testimony
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm kind of curious as to why
 
02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:40.830 align:start position:0%
um i'm kind of curious as to why
churchill

02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
churchill
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
downs has such an interest in the
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory nature and enforcement
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
of charitable gaming rooms in the state
 
02:03:50.070 --> 02:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire maybe you can explain
 
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
that with some clarity for me
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative as i mentioned you know
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
churchill downs is more than a racetrack
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
we operate 10 gaming facilities in nine
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
states uh constantly looking for
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
opportunities that may arise and
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
obviously as i pointed out and last year
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
testified as well
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
um you know looking for opportunities
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
that come up and in this case um the one
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
o'clock bill was the more interesting
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
one but this one really you know it's
 
02:04:17.199 --> 02:04:18.550 align:start position:0%
one but this one really you know it's
foundational

02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
foundational
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
right there's so much money flowing in
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
it has to be kept track of in order to
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
protect the charities so churchill downs
 
02:04:27.750 --> 02:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
is interested in opportunities that may
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
come up um
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire's a state that they've
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
had their eye on
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh i guess we didn't get to the point
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
that i thought you'd take care mr
 
02:04:41.599 --> 02:04:42.709 align:start position:0%
that i thought you'd take care mr
bragdon

02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
bragdon
 
02:04:42.719 --> 02:04:43.750 align:start position:0%
bragdon
uh

02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
churchill downs is the owner operator of
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
the oxford casino in maine correct
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
correct and maybe you could tell us what
 
02:04:54.550 --> 02:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
revenues or the total receipts say last
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
year for oxford casino was
 
02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
year for oxford casino was
um

02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i have no idea
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
what that cannot hear him sorry guys
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
can you speak up
 
02:05:08.709 --> 02:05:08.719 align:start position:0%
mr brighton
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry um i have no idea what the
 
02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
revenues are for the oxford casino okay
 
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm
 
02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing there's probably a
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
percentage of those dollars that come
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
from the state of new hampshire so
 
02:05:26.470 --> 02:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
i guess your your concern about or not
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
so much your concern but the concern of
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
churchill downs
 
02:05:33.669 --> 02:05:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the operation and enforcement of
 
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in new hampshire would
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
probably have an effect on the bottom
 
02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
probably have an effect on the bottom
line

02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
over an oxford
 
02:05:46.229 --> 02:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
oxford casino or am i mistaken
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
representative i really have no idea not
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
only what the revenues in oxford are or
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
from whence they come i do know that
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
churchill downs operates in nine states
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
and would be interested in operating
 
02:05:57.280 --> 02:06:00.550 align:start position:0%
and would be interested in operating
more

02:06:00.550 --> 02:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
so can you testify that if
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire charitable gaming and the
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
charities that are served by charitable
 
02:06:21.199 --> 02:06:22.629 align:start position:0%
charities that are served by charitable
gaming

02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
succeed in new hampshire
 
02:06:29.270 --> 02:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
is that a revenue loss for churchill
 
02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:30.629 align:start position:0%
is that a revenue loss for churchill
downs

02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
downs
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
in the oxford maine casino
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
so we're in competition now the
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
charities are in competition the state
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire is in competition with
 
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
your client churchill downs is what i'm
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
is that saying
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
former question
 
02:06:45.199 --> 02:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
former question
yes

02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
are they in competition
 
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and again i
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the breakdown is of
 
02:06:58.229 --> 02:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
play at the oxford casino in oxford
 
02:06:58.239 --> 02:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
play at the oxford casino in oxford
maine

02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
maine
 
02:07:01.109 --> 02:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
but i do know that churchill downs
 
02:07:03.189 --> 02:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
operates in nine different states and is
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
always looking opportunities to operate
 
02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
in others and should they operate
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know hypothetically in new hampshire
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
um to the degree that's competing with
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
what they do in maine my feeling as a
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
businessman was always it's better to
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
compete with myself than to compete with
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
someone else so i think they'd be
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity if it presented itself
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
in a favorable way

chair of
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
representatives to ask a question
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you senator bradley bragging
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:25.510 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
uh

02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think the biggest problem that our
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
commission dealt with was
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
02:08:31.679 --> 02:08:32.550 align:start position:0%
the fact that
that

02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
we try to add positions
 
02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the lottery
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
that those somehow don't make it through
 
02:08:38.960 --> 02:08:40.790 align:start position:0%
that those somehow don't make it through
finance

02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
finance
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that's the biggest obstacle that we
 
02:08:44.790 --> 02:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
all have to deal with is
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
how do we convince
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
because that would that would reduce the
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
monies going to the education trust fund
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh because you know it's net of expense
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
so if we had three or four more people
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
which we didn't recommend
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh we're always faced with finance
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
looking for money and you you know being
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
seeing senate president
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know what i'm talking about
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's if you have any ideas or
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions for how to convince the
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
legislature that this is an important
 
02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:22.390 align:start position:0%
legislature that this is an important
matter

02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
matter
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
being former senate president
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative romney for
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
the question and i will point out the
 
02:09:30.310 --> 02:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
report definitely says these are things
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
that need to be done yet it is in some
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
ways beyond the control of the lottery
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
commission and i certainly don't want to
 
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:39.280 align:start position:0%
imply that the lottery commission
 
02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:40.149 align:start position:0%
imply that the lottery commission
um

02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's fundamental flaws if you do
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
the reports all indicate it's a matter
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
of resources and in terms of
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh convincing the finance committees
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
that these are things to be supportive i
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
think you know
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
maybe one way is to focus on the
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
potential downsides take a look at that
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
one particular charity that
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
although they made 70 000
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
in a year
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
um from the operations that they had
 
02:10:10.069 --> 02:10:10.079 align:start position:0%
there was another 130 000
 
02:10:10.079 --> 02:10:10.950 align:start position:0%
there was another 130 000
that

02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
was unaccounted for
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so again we want to make sure i
 
02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
think we're all concerned in new
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire about our charities and making
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
sure they get what is due especially in
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
these tough
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
economic times that we're in
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
and so i think the focus really needs to
 
02:10:26.079 --> 02:10:26.790 align:start position:0%
and so i think the focus really needs to
be

02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
that um if if something goes wrong right
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
if something goes wrong it'll
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh put the whole system into a mode of
 
02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
suspicion and actually might hurt
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
everybody across the board so i do i do
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
understand uh representative uh in a way
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
more than most i suppose that haven't
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
served in the legislature
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
the difficulties of navigating the
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
financial piece as well as the policy
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:01.189 align:start position:0%
any further questions
zen

02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%

02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any other hands raised
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
but i have a pink sheet here
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the paint sheet shows that we have
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
but none of these people want to testify
 
02:11:26.550 --> 02:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
and support is a heidi hammer
 
02:11:27.990 --> 02:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
season like
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%

had mentioned earlier we had planned to

02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
exacting on about five bills
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%

02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and we get it put up on i have a copy of
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
it ready if
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
there was a way for me to do that
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
jane can you put a copy of
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.719 --> 02:15:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.069 --> 02:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
can you put a copy of the amendment
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
for house bill 306.

either
 
02:15:21.199 --> 02:15:22.550 align:start position:0%
either
so

02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
with all of those other huge numbers of
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
people saying that they want more money
 
02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
people saying that they want more money
so

02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:38.470 --> 02:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
is there a way i could put it up
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
jennifer's jennifer's there

02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're muted
 
02:15:58.950 --> 02:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's no way to take it from gallery
 
02:16:01.620 --> 02:16:01.630 align:start position:0%
no because that's a controller
 
02:16:01.630 --> 02:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
no because that's a controller
[Music]

02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay i'm trying to
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
to get both that and the screen up at
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
the same time so
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
just give me a second here
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i had had it sitting there so i
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
could look at it
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's too small right so let me go up a
 
02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:36.950 align:start position:0%
that's too small right so let me go up a
bit

02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:16:39.509 --> 02:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.399 --> 02:16:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
great

02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.509 --> 02:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
mr chairman would you talk to it or
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
would you like me to talk to it
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead
 
02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.190 align:start position:0%
why don't you go ahead
okay

02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.070 align:start position:0%
okay
the

02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:02.950 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
what this takes out
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
they rewrote it instead of of doing the
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
taking out parts
 
02:17:11.040 --> 02:17:12.830 align:start position:0%
taking out parts
on

02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:17.190 align:start position:0%
number one
on

02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
roman one in the original bill
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
says that on
 
02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
if the unrestricted revenue estimate
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
while operating under the emergency
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
executive orders issued in response to
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the coven 19 pandemic and after the
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
orders expire
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then goes on in the original two
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
to say the estimate will be based on
 
02:17:44.549 --> 02:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
current law and economic conditions and
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
shall be updated regularly throughout fy
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
21 2
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
and 3 to reflect current conditions and
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
economic forecasts
 
02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
economic forecasts
and

02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:55.679 --> 02:17:57.509 align:start position:0%
and
what

02:17:57.509 --> 02:17:57.519 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
i did to that
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually i took out current conditions
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
and economic forecasts the second time
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
what i did instead was to take out while
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
operating under emergency executive
 
02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:15.190 align:start position:0%
operating under emergency executive
orders

02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:16.230 align:start position:0%
orders
and

02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.509 align:start position:0%
and
the

02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:17.519 --> 02:18:18.469 align:start position:0%
the
the

02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:18.479 --> 02:18:19.230 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
specification of fiscal years one two
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
and three 21 22 and 23
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
and leave the rest of it there
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
and i wish that they'd done it that way
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
so that you could see it but they didn't
 
02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:35.830 align:start position:0%
so that you could see it but they didn't
uh

02:18:35.830 --> 02:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:18:39.429 --> 02:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that this is
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
something we've always done the chair
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
has always decided when there was
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
something tricky going on in the economy
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
that could affect our revenues
 
02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:50.150 align:start position:0%
that could affect our revenues
or

02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
on a major bill had been passed that
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
upset our revenues
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh in the second year when it was
 
02:18:57.200 --> 02:18:59.910 align:start position:0%
uh in the second year when it was
effective

02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
the chair would call
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
the committee together to look at
 
02:19:06.549 --> 02:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates again
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
or at least the part of it that they
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
thought was affected
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
and on sometimes the agencies for both
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
of us have been
 
02:19:15.840 --> 02:19:17.190 align:start position:0%
of us have been
on

02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
have been reluctant to go through the
 
02:19:21.509 --> 02:19:21.519 align:start position:0%
process again and have wanted to hold to
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were
 
02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:24.549 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were
were

02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
put into the budget
 
02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
put into the budget
on

02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:29.589 align:start position:0%
on
and

02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
the chair's
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
reason for putting this still in
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
was to
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
to overcome the cha the
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
agency's reluctance to participate
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
on it at least gives a stimulus to them
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
that we have something in law we have
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
never had the process of revenue
 
02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
estimates in law
 
02:19:56.240 --> 02:19:57.110 align:start position:0%
estimates in law
on

02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
since they were started in 1971
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
and i know that because i was given the
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
entire history when i became chair by
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
the then clerk of the house
 
02:20:09.439 --> 02:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
the then clerk of the house
and

02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:11.750 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.950 align:start position:0%
um
it's

02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
this would be the first part that would
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
be in law and i did not want to see it
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
go in as something that we were only
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
doing for three years because then the
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
agencies would say
 
02:20:24.319 --> 02:20:25.110 align:start position:0%
agencies would say
say

02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:26.389 align:start position:0%
say
but

02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
and on representative major agreed with
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
me about that and asked me to bring in a
 
02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
trial amendment and here it is
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
alemay did an excellent job in
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
modifying this bill
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
because it is very important
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
not only
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
because we all know
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
that the economic situation can change
 
02:21:00.469 --> 02:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
dramatically with
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
without any warning such as the pandemic
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
or other other type of disasters
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
so this gives us the ability that it's
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
codified now in statute that we can do
 
02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:14.389 align:start position:0%
codified now in statute that we can do
this

02:21:14.389 --> 02:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
even though uh in the past there's times
 
02:21:20.550 --> 02:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
we've done it
 
02:21:22.790 --> 02:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
and the speaker
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
would go along with it but there's been
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
times that i've wanted to
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
redo the revenue estimates
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
and i've been told not to
 
02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:34.150 align:start position:0%
and i've been told not to
and

02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
my feeling is and i think it should be
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
the feeling in the ways and means if the
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
economic conditions change
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
to update the revenues
 
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
let's say if they
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
were reduced
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
to warn the finance committee to warn
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
the executive branch
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
that the revenues aren't going to be
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
there and start taking action
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this they won't know
 
02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.389 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this they won't know
this

02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and so we would actually be doing our
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to add to that
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
any

02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative tucker has her hand up
 
02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
represented tucker
 
02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:33.030 align:start position:0%
represented tucker
i

02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:22:33.040 --> 02:22:33.910 align:start position:0%
i
yes

02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
i can't find the reference but i
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
actually have been reading the kefir
 
02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:41.270 align:start position:0%
actually have been reading the kefir
and

02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
there are occasions in that where
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
i think under tobacco tax for example
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
it says that the agency will be looking
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
every quarter
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i think you need a phrase that says
 
02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:55.510 align:start position:0%
so i think you need a phrase that says
notwithstanding

02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
other references or something
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
and so maybe that's why there's been a
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
difference between the agency's view
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
because they
 
02:23:06.469 --> 02:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
they have it built into their system
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
that even though it isn't in the statute
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
that they will do whatever you so often
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
and so we need to make sure that there
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
isn't a conflict there and i wish i
 
02:23:21.359 --> 02:23:22.309 align:start position:0%
isn't a conflict there and i wish i
could

02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
find the reference it'll
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
but we have a time to take it up i think
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we be able to
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be able to find the
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's a big document
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to be able to find
 
02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:42.790 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to be able to find
uh

02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:58.389 --> 02:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry i don't seem to be able to
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
raise my hand while i'm i'm sharing a
 
02:24:00.720 --> 02:24:01.750 align:start position:0%
raise my hand while i'm i'm sharing a
screen

02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
but on
 
02:24:04.479 --> 02:24:05.349 align:start position:0%
but on
i

02:24:05.349 --> 02:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think this would be a problem
 
02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
but maybe we should
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we need to ask the
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
comptroller on
 
02:24:15.120 --> 02:24:16.389 align:start position:0%
comptroller on
but

02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
that is a regulation but also when we do
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
do this
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
on we usually don't try to force the
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
agency to tell us what the
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
this the last month has has done if they
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
had to do a complicated calculation
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
three months ago
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
by their own
 
02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:42.389 align:start position:0%
by their own
regulations

02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
right maybe that takes care of it
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
i do think it's very important when
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
things are unexpected that we're able to
 
02:24:50.319 --> 02:24:54.630 align:start position:0%
things are unexpected that we're able to
respond

02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think we could work around that but we
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:06.070 --> 02:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's a major i i can see
 
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative ames has his hand up i
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
think that's all the hands
 
02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:13.110 align:start position:0%
think that's all the hands
[Music]

02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
okay well wait a minute
 
02:25:18.070 --> 02:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i'm unmuted
 
02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:19.030 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i'm unmuted
yes

02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:25:23.910 --> 02:25:23.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah this is an excellent change i i
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
was uh quite concerned with the
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
original version of the bill because i
 
02:25:31.110 --> 02:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
i thought that it once the emergency
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
passes this particular emergency passes
 
02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
passes this particular emergency passes
the

02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
implication of the bill would be that
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
somehow the ways and means committee
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
no long would no longer have the
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
power the ability to
 
02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
power the ability to
do

02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:25:52.469 --> 02:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
estimates as economic conditions changed
 
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
so this makes it clear that we have that
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
authority i think i actually think that
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
we already have it but dive agencies are
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
recalcitrant as has been reported by
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
both representatives almighty and major
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
and they should know if anyone knows
 
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
that history
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
then i think this is a very good thing
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
to put into the statutes and uh
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is well for representative me but i
 
02:26:29.910 --> 02:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
support the bill i support the amendment
 
02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:31.030 align:start position:0%
support the bill i support the amendment
um

02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
but for representative tucker each
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
mentions tobacco
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
as one area that
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
if i heard it correctly but that
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco's on the department of revenue
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
um and i can't recall anytime that we've
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
asked department of revenue to help us
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
out and do something that it was an
 
02:26:48.319 --> 02:26:49.349 align:start position:0%
out and do something that it was an
issue

02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:26:49.359 --> 02:26:50.230 align:start position:0%
issue
is

02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
it was am i correct in hearing about
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative tucker that it was in
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
tobacco that you saw this or was it the
 
02:26:56.319 --> 02:26:57.429 align:start position:0%
tobacco that you saw this or was it the
ag's

02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
ag's
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh the tobacco uh settlement
 
02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:07.110 align:start position:0%
uh the tobacco uh settlement
thanks

02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.830 --> 02:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
sorry i muted myself yes it was under
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
tobacco it wasn't under the settlement
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
it just would be a phrase but
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
if it's not necessary it's not necessary
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
it'll be good
 
02:27:27.830 --> 02:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
but i think it's very important that we
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
have this
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
kind of amendment
 
02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:31.670 align:start position:0%
kind of amendment
yeah

02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:27:34.389 --> 02:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
what one what this also does
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
we can go to the floor and update the
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
house resolution
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
and as
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
as the economic conditions dictate
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then with the house resolution
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
it will deviate
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
from what the
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
revenues are in the budget because the
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
revenues that are in the budget is
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
what's passed
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%

02:28:00.399 --> 02:28:01.429 align:start position:0%
the committee of compromise between the
housing

02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%

02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
and the senate
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
that will always be in the budget but
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
this will warn them
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
hey their evidence aren't going to be
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%

02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
like we thought they were going to be in

02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%

02:28:28.399 --> 02:28:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:28:29.359 --> 02:28:36.469 align:start position:0%

was the
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
primary aim of the
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the sponsor but he added into it in
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
case a lot of places would show up all
 
02:39:11.429 --> 02:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
of a sudden that wanted to do this on
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
on a ban
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
a removal of the ban on a cap
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
no wait a minute let me see how i did it
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
a removal of the cap of 10 locations
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
that was in the bill that we passed last
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
time because
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
we really don't know how these things
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
are going to work out and some people
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
are worried about uh
 
02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:36.830 align:start position:0%
are worried about uh
creating

02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
creating
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
competition that on
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
would stop a lot of people from even
 
02:39:42.479 --> 02:39:43.750 align:start position:0%
would stop a lot of people from even
applying

02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
applying
 
02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:44.630 align:start position:0%
applying
for

02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
sports locations
 
02:39:50.309 --> 02:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
and as i recall representative
 
02:39:53.830 --> 02:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
bromi was interested in the cap being
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
kept and
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
a number of other people spoke and
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
charlie uh also spoke and said that
 
02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
charlie uh also spoke and said that
there

02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:40:04.230 --> 02:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
he doesn't see any way that at least
 
02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
within two years we're going to get even
 
02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:08.230 align:start position:0%
within two years we're going to get even
10

02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
10
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that another bill could be brought in
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
at that time when we knew more about how
 
02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
these are working
 
02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:16.710 align:start position:0%
these are working
so

02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:40:19.670 --> 02:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is to keep
 
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
in line seven and eight the existing
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
language that says no more than ten
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
sportsbook retail locations may be in
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
operation at any given time
 
02:40:31.910 --> 02:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
but you know it puts back the tier two
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
that our committee had added before it
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%

02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative alame um i
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
was speaking with the sponsor about this
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
bill yesterday and uh i think that he
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
noted to me that there were 16 towns
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
that had applied for the licenses for
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
the sports betting in the state and if
 
02:41:47.990 --> 02:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
we keep the cap at 10
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
then are we going to tell them just in
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
case this speeds up and if the lottery
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
approves more and more than they thought
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
they would that they are not going to be
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
if i presume that's to me so
 
02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:06.309 align:start position:0%
if i presume that's to me so
on

02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
what on we were told by the lottery was
 
02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:10.469 align:start position:0%
what on we were told by the lottery was
that

02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
it is a very complicated process to set
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
these up and that
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
they have had i think it is
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
eight applications to date and are only
 
02:42:24.070 --> 02:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
seriously pursuing
 
02:42:26.070 --> 02:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
two of them with the possibility after
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
that of a third
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
may i follow up mr chairman
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
would be would we consider raising that
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
and to me i i i believe that
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
on if
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
if they get near anywhere near the 10
 
02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:48.870 align:start position:0%
if they get near anywhere near the 10
that

02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
that could then be
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
be considered i mean of course it could
 
02:42:55.190 --> 02:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
be considered by the committee in two
 
02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:56.230 align:start position:0%
be considered by the committee in two
years

02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
and not next year according to our roles
 
02:43:00.790 --> 02:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
unless we changed our rules
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elmi thank you
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody
 
02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:15.349 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody
question

02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay then
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
speaking on the amendment
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.990 --> 02:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
speak against the amendment um and i
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
really just think we should uh take a
 
02:43:33.910 --> 02:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
step back as a committee um and and one
 
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
thing i think is important and i know we
 
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
have a wide range of ideologies and
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
beliefs among committee members but both
 
02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
from a
 
02:43:43.349 --> 02:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
um a conservative and a liberal
 
02:43:46.070 --> 02:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
perspective i think um you know i think
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is a a little bit
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
of a rush to judgment i mean i know
 
02:43:52.309 --> 02:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
there's a concern about if we go from
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
having a small number to 10 or more
 
02:43:57.190 --> 02:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
what's the impact going to be on the
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
existing businesses but from a
 
02:44:01.190 --> 02:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
pro-business perspective that's the
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
angle you want to look at this from
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
you have to be pro opportunity to be pro
 
02:44:08.710 --> 02:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
business as greg moore from afp
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
testified we don't want a taxi
 
02:44:13.190 --> 02:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
medallion-like system where failing
 
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
businesses that aren't actually
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
providing a quality service for
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
customers and for towns and ultimately
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
revenues um for the government where
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
they can make millions of dollars just
 
02:44:25.110 --> 02:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
off the fact that they have a license
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
that the politicians have given them
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
and from a fairness perspective as well
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
um you know you can simply look at from
 
02:44:35.190 --> 02:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
that angle um why should we make it
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
where if someone wants to start up
 
02:44:40.790 --> 02:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
um they might have to incur a cost down
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
the road of millions of dollars to get
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
the license once we've hit that cap of
 
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
10 even if we don't think that we're
 
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to hit that cap necessarily that
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
is a potential
 
02:44:51.359 --> 02:44:52.230 align:start position:0%
is a potential
um

02:44:52.230 --> 02:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know impact that we might be
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
creating without thinking we're doing so
 
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
so we should be very careful from that
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
and ultimately um in terms of just the
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
health of the the gaming system
 
02:45:05.429 --> 02:45:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not kind of like the wild
 
02:45:08.550 --> 02:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
west like we might originally think um
 
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
you know charlie from lottery draftkings
 
02:45:12.550 --> 02:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're only going to approve operations
 
02:45:14.309 --> 02:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
that make financial sense for everyone
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
involved so i think it's better to leave
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
it to the professionals than to have us
 
02:45:20.469 --> 02:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
set this artificial cap so i'm going to
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
are you speaking
 
02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:31.030 align:start position:0%
are you speaking
yes

02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
or you have a question
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
well i have a question that kind of
 
02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
follows on what uh representative baxter
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
just said
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
um the argument that we are creating a
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
new york taxi medallion
 
02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:45.990 align:start position:0%
new york taxi medallion
um

02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
um
situation

02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:49.910 align:start position:0%
situation
uh

02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
that there may be some validity to that
 
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
if you have only ten
 
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh books open
 
02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
rather than letting the what adam smith
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
call the the hidden hand of the free
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
market guide these uh
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
variety of stores
 
02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:08.630 align:start position:0%
variety of stores
um

02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
or book locations i don't even know what
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
they are i don't gamble
 
02:46:14.950 --> 02:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
every time i do i lose so
 
02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:15.990 align:start position:0%
every time i do i lose so
uh

02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh
the

02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:19.349 --> 02:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
maybe setting a cap on this is not
 
02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
a good idea
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion on this i'm willing to
 
02:46:29.030 --> 02:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
set this through
 
02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
set this through
now

02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
but i would prefer it without
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
a cap
 
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
we can always add one later things get
 
02:46:38.630 --> 02:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
out of hand i mean that's one good one
 
02:46:40.230 --> 02:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
thing government's good at is screwing
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
chair it's pat that's representative
 
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:49.110 align:start position:0%
chair it's pat that's representative
representative

02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i i did speak up early on on this
 
02:46:54.710 --> 02:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
and i i did support uh
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
keeping the cap we gotta remember this
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill passed last year
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
with the cap
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh for a reason
 
02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:04.150 align:start position:0%
uh for a reason
uh

02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
yes i'm a free market kind of guy too
 
02:47:09.590 --> 02:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
but in this in this regard i i think
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a disincentive like uh i think
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
representative helmy said
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
to businesses getting in because they
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
know there's only so many
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
people that are going to bet
 
02:47:19.359 --> 02:47:20.870 align:start position:0%
people that are going to bet
uh

02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
i i again we we voted it in this way
 
02:47:25.990 --> 02:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
right now there's only two locations and
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's been over a year
 
02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:29.030 align:start position:0%
it's been over a year
uh

02:47:29.030 --> 02:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm going to uh and absolutely if
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
we see that we hit eight or nine
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have another bill we can expand it
 
02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:37.590 align:start position:0%
we'll have another bill we can expand it
then

02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just concerned about the
 
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
disincentive of somebody because there's
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of money getting involved in
 
02:47:44.990 --> 02:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
getting into this game
 
02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.230 align:start position:0%
getting into this game
[Music]

02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
and uh plus you have to pass the
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that the test i think is a lot
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
higher uh on this one in terms of
 
02:47:55.830 --> 02:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
getting a a license to do this
 
02:47:55.840 --> 02:47:57.030 align:start position:0%
getting a a license to do this
uh

02:47:57.030 --> 02:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
more than any other business would be uh
 
02:48:02.389 --> 02:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
non-gambling business
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
so um i'm going to support the amendment
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
relax on you
 
02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:15.030 align:start position:0%
relax on you
okay

02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:48:17.750 --> 02:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay um thank you um
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree with uh much of what
 
02:48:22.630 --> 02:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative rami just said um
 
02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:23.990 align:start position:0%
representative rami just said um
and

02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll vote for
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment with the cap in it um
 
02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
the amendment with the cap in it um
and

02:48:31.910 --> 02:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
i just have two points one is that
 
02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
we worked long and hard on this
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
legislation i believe it was two years
 
02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:42.389 align:start position:0%
legislation i believe it was two years
ago

02:48:42.389 --> 02:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
to get it to a point where it could get
 
02:48:47.349 --> 02:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
support and be enacted
 
02:48:47.359 --> 02:48:48.230 align:start position:0%
support and be enacted
um

02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:52.150 --> 02:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
part of that was putting in this uh
 
02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
this cap this 10
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
sportsbook cap and
 
02:48:59.429 --> 02:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
i think that was part of the chemistry
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
um that led to enactment um like
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
you never can know for sure what
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
elements uh are persuasive or not but i
 
02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
think that was one of them and uh
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that's not to say that it couldn't
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
be changed uh if uh circumstances change
 
02:49:18.070 --> 02:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
and the need for
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
additional sports books is
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
apparent and on that second point um
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
i you may recall that i asked uh when we
 
02:49:28.870 --> 02:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
heard the bill
 
02:49:28.880 --> 02:49:29.990 align:start position:0%
heard the bill
for

02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
information that would give us a better
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
understanding of sports books
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
you know the contracts uh that provide
 
02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:38.550 align:start position:0%
you know the contracts uh that provide
for

02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
the operation of the sports books the uh
 
02:49:44.150 --> 02:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
nature of the locations the um
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
a number number of pieces of information
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
um and i'm sure we'll get that in due
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
course but uh there's no urgency here so
 
02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think we should go forward with the
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
bill uh not change the uh
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
the cap and get tier two into the uh
 
02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
into the system um
 
02:50:05.590 --> 02:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
and uh as time goes forward uh we'll
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
either see increased demand for sports
 
02:50:10.710 --> 02:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
book locations or we won't in the
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
meantime we'll get better informed on
 
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
what's what this uh concept of sports
 
02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
what's what this uh concept of sports
book

02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
book
 
02:50:21.030 --> 02:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
translates to in in real physical and
 
02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
financial forms thank you
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
representing southwark
 
02:50:30.550 --> 02:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i support the amendment um
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
i recall the sponsors worked very hard
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill and i think it is too soon
 
02:50:38.150 --> 02:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
to change the cap thank you
 
02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else who is
 
02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.429 align:start position:0%
anybody else who is
testifying

02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:41.439 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
or have questions
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is mr chairman
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
i still can't raise my hand could i
 
02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
speak for a second time very briefly yes
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
i think i think that this um is in the
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
nature of a bank
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
the people who have the sports books are
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
holding a great deal of money from
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
people and they are supposed to pay a
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
lot of it back
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
and in places where
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
and before they were really regulated uh
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
in britain they didn't do a lot of these
 
02:51:19.840 --> 02:51:20.630 align:start position:0%
in britain they didn't do a lot of these
on

02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
on
they

02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:23.190 align:start position:0%
they
uh

02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
there would be sports book
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
people that would just not pay it back
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
and on i think this is why lottery makes
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
it on
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
makes the application process very long
 
02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:38.230 align:start position:0%
makes the application process very long
and

02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:51:42.790 --> 02:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
and difficult is that they have to make
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
sure that they are going to pay it back
 
02:51:48.150 --> 02:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:50.309 --> 02:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
chair one more follow-up question uh
 
02:51:50.319 --> 02:51:51.750 align:start position:0%
chair one more follow-up question uh
representative

02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah let's not lose sight of the fact
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
that the major part of this bill is the
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
tier two betting
 
02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
and that's major that will make the uh
 
02:52:00.240 --> 02:52:01.190 align:start position:0%
and that's major that will make the uh
the

02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
ability to do the same kind of bets that
 
02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
you do on the app
 
02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
in person now so
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think that really accomplishes a major
 
02:52:09.670 --> 02:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
move forward so
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh we should let's fight that piece and
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
then and then look at
 
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
eliminating the cap at another date
 
02:52:19.190 --> 02:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
on the amendment representative major
 
02:52:26.309 --> 02:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
this is representative berstein i'm
 
02:52:27.990 --> 02:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
unable to raise my hand as well but i
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:52:32.950 --> 02:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:52:34.469 --> 02:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
as far as the optimal number of
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
locations i i have no idea perhaps the
 
02:52:43.030 --> 02:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
optimal numbers too maybe it's 10 maybe
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's 20 but by limiting it
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think we serve the consumer i
 
02:52:50.630 --> 02:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
mean the best way to serve the consumer
 
02:52:52.950 --> 02:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
is to let the market work its course and
 
02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
to let competition
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh flourish
 
02:52:59.750 --> 02:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps the future is i don't know
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
virtual reality uh you can
 
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
as though you're in the football game in
 
02:53:06.230 --> 02:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
one of the i mean who knows what the
 
02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
market will come up with
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
but i think that limiting it and capping
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
it will inhibit
 
02:53:16.309 --> 02:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh creativity and entrepreneurship and
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i think that the customer is the
 
02:53:18.399 --> 02:53:19.429 align:start position:0%
and i think that the customer is the
loser

02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
loser
 
02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just not smart enough to put a cap
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
on this thing i would much rather it be
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
left up to the market and and the
 
02:53:29.349 --> 02:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
decision not be made centrally by a
 
02:53:30.710 --> 02:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of
 
02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh by by
 
02:53:35.030 --> 02:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
by us i would rather let the market
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
handle it so i will be voting against
 
02:53:39.750 --> 02:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment mr chair

later introduced house bill 626
 
04:05:24.389 --> 04:05:24.399 align:start position:0%
so you're aware there's also a similar
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill over in the senate uh senate bill
 
04:05:28.000 --> 04:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
bill over in the senate uh senate bill
112

04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
112
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
with many of the senators uh sponsoring
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
last time we had a similar bill
 
04:05:38.070 --> 04:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh that got very positive vote out of
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
weights and means it wasn't unanimous
 
04:05:40.950 --> 04:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
but we got a very positive vote out of
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
ways he means
 
04:05:45.030 --> 04:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
that bill was tabled on the floor at 3
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
a.m in the morning
 
04:05:49.670 --> 04:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the session that lasted until 4 a.m
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
and if you recall
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
the next day is when the state house
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
closed down
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
for 3-4 months
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
our plan was to pull that bill off the
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
table uh but that never that opportunity
 
04:06:03.910 --> 04:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
never occurred
 
04:06:06.150 --> 04:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
so with that we refiled the bill
 
04:06:06.160 --> 04:06:08.070 align:start position:0%
so with that we refiled the bill
uh

04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
let me explain what historic racing is
 
04:06:13.030 --> 04:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
first off historic racing is a new game
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
that would be brought into our venues
 
04:06:17.590 --> 04:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
that support charitable gaming
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
so this these machines can only
 
04:06:21.910 --> 04:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
be located in charitable gaining
 
04:06:21.920 --> 04:06:24.070 align:start position:0%
be located in charitable gaining
locations

04:06:24.070 --> 04:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
locations
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
let me start with the
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
kind of the history of perry mutual
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
wagering in new hampshire
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
perry mutual wagering goes back to the
 
04:06:30.800 --> 04:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
perry mutual wagering goes back to the
1930s

04:06:32.870 --> 04:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
1930s
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
became the basis for our horse and dog
 
04:06:38.229 --> 04:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
track bedding
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
over the years four major locations spun
 
04:06:40.960 --> 04:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
over the years four major locations spun
up

04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:06:44.070 --> 04:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
and lasted many many years
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
but i would say died at their own weight
 
04:06:49.590 --> 04:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
or of uh changing generations uh the
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
racing was too slow for the
 
04:06:53.110 --> 04:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
new younger people
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh too much time between races things
 
04:06:55.910 --> 04:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
and then the horse race on the on the
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
dog track side there was a lot of bad
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
press also about
 
04:07:04.630 --> 04:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
the way dogs were being treated
 
04:07:04.640 --> 04:07:05.750 align:start position:0%
the way dogs were being treated
therefore

04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
live racing disappeared over the last
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
decade or so
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
the current statute says some chaos
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
racing can occur at any former track as
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
i said there was four of them
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
that for many years was rockingham park
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
and seabrook dog track
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
until rockingham was torn down several
 
04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
years ago to make way for a mixed-use uh
 
04:07:27.990 --> 04:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh development
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
so that leaves
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
seabrook which is now called the brook
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
is the only location with simulcast
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
racing and when i say simulcast racing
 
04:07:39.269 --> 04:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
that means you can place a bet anywhere
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
in the country on any race that's going
 
04:07:41.199 --> 04:07:41.910 align:start position:0%
in the country on any race that's going
on

04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:07:41.920 --> 04:07:43.429 align:start position:0%
on
live

04:07:43.429 --> 04:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
live
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
the reason i mention all this is the
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
point here is that the systems and
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
controls are in place already to support
 
04:07:51.510 --> 04:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
historic racing
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
all of this is based on the same
 
04:07:53.279 --> 04:07:54.630 align:start position:0%
all of this is based on the same
technology

04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
and we already have a regulatory
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
structure in place
 
04:08:01.349 --> 04:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
for parry mutual racing
 
04:08:03.429 --> 04:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
so let's let me spend a minute now
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
i know the members who've been around a
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
while know what this is about but for
 
04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
the new members
 
04:08:12.710 --> 04:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
so what is historic racing
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
so tarot gaming race uh locations will
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
get terminals
 
04:08:19.510 --> 04:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
that which bets can be placed on horse
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
races that occurred in the past
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
the terminals are connected to a
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
again that have occurred already
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
the turtle makes available true and
 
04:08:32.560 --> 04:08:33.670 align:start position:0%
the turtle makes available true and
actual

04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
actual
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
past performance information to aid
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
players in making informed choices as to
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
how to bet
 
04:08:42.550 --> 04:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
so what am i what am i talking about so
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
if you're on a track you have the racing
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
form the racing forum tells you
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
everything you want to know about the
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
horses that are racing the jockeys etc
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
these machines have drop down screens to
 
04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
tell you the same information but it
 
04:08:56.469 --> 04:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you the name of the horse
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
it gives you a b c d
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
and horse a
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
this is its record etc etc does the same
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
for the jockeys doesn't tell you the
 
04:09:05.830 --> 04:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
name of the jockeys so you can't
 
04:09:05.840 --> 04:09:07.030 align:start position:0%
name of the jockeys so you can't
identify

04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
identify
 
04:09:08.150 --> 04:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
any of these it doesn't tell you the
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
location of the race either so you can't
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
ever go back and
 
04:09:11.279 --> 04:09:12.150 align:start position:0%
ever go back and
and

04:09:12.150 --> 04:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
try to figure out you know what race
 
04:09:16.150 --> 04:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
this was and know the actual outcome
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
before you place it back that's the
 
04:09:17.840 --> 04:09:19.830 align:start position:0%
before you place it back that's the
point

04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
but you place the bet as if you're at
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
the racetrack
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
again this is paramutual wagering
 
04:09:28.150 --> 04:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
so winnings are based on all others
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
there is something called a totalizer
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
that calculates trend nuclear pools and
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
payouts associated with each winning
 
04:09:38.880 --> 04:09:40.469 align:start position:0%
payouts associated with each winning
wager

04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
wager
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to emphasize that we the
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
lottery commission is very familiar with
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
totalizers because of seabrook and
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
channel cast we deal with totalizers
 
04:09:53.110 --> 04:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
where this data goes and it
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
calculates the winnings
 
04:09:57.439 --> 04:09:58.150 align:start position:0%
calculates the winnings
so

04:09:58.150 --> 04:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
these machines will be collected to the
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
totalizer that will calculate the
 
04:10:01.680 --> 04:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
totalizer that will calculate the
winnings

04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
winnings
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
just as and again i'm emphasizing this
 
04:10:07.510 --> 04:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
because lottery is very familiar with
 
04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
this it isn't something new that they
 
04:10:11.189 --> 04:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
have to learn
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
there is a quick pick feature that
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
allows betting on on favorites
 
04:10:16.080 --> 04:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
allows betting on on favorites
so

04:10:17.670 --> 04:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
we when you're if you're i i think i've
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
been to a heart track twice in my life
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
but there's a big board before the race
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
you see what the odds are the odds are
 
04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
changing constantly until until uh the
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
race begins
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
and many people will wait and place
 
04:10:35.590 --> 04:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
their bed until the very end
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
and they will place it
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know parts one is two to one
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
three two is five to one then one they
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
want to see what the odds are
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
right before and that's based on the
 
04:10:46.469 --> 04:10:46.479 align:start position:0%
people betting
 
04:10:46.479 --> 04:10:47.429 align:start position:0%
people betting
so

04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:47.439 --> 04:10:48.309 align:start position:0%
so
uh

04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's a feature in here part of the
 
04:10:49.760 --> 04:10:50.630 align:start position:0%
there's a feature in here part of the
quick

04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
quick
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
quick pick feature is that
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
automatically sends you to
 
04:10:59.590 --> 04:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
that uh information so that you you if
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
you want to bet that way in a quick way
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
you will know that and you can bet that
 
04:11:03.520 --> 04:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
you will know that and you can bet that
way

04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
so why do i support historic racing
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
very simple
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
and this all of us have to have a little
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
soul-searching on this bill
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
i i support this wholeheartedly because
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
it expands the offerings of charitable
 
04:11:19.439 --> 04:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
it expands the offerings of charitable
gaming

04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
and you understand that we support 500
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
charities throughout new hampshire right
 
04:11:25.279 --> 04:11:26.150 align:start position:0%
charities throughout new hampshire right
now

04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:11:27.349 --> 04:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to talk about in a minute
 
04:11:29.269 --> 04:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
is that this bill will expand the number
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
of charities that can become involved
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
which is a different this is different
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.309 --> 04:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
you must have a charitable gaming
 
04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
license to offer the game
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
and again there are 15 locations in the
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
state that offer charitable gaming
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the latest one up in conway area
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
so what's new about this bill is that it
 
04:11:57.269 --> 04:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
requires a licensee to contract with two
 
04:11:57.279 --> 04:11:59.030 align:start position:0%
requires a licensee to contract with two
charities

04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
charities
 
04:11:59.040 --> 04:11:59.910 align:start position:0%
charities
each

04:11:59.910 --> 04:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
each
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
for the licensed game days we heard uh
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
we heard uh president gore mentioned
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
earlier that you know you had 10 dates
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
so your charity you get 10 dates
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to you
 
04:12:13.110 --> 04:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
so what this bill is going to do is say
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
well we're going to have two charities
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
just for these any winnings on these
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
machines to go to charities
 
04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
there will be two charities to sign
 
04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh the ability
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
those those dates for any winnings from
 
04:12:27.189 --> 04:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
those machines and that they would be
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
split 50 50 between the charities uh for
 
04:12:32.229 --> 04:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
those 10 days
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
so this is something new
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
and again this is the other the other
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
piece in there and just something we can
 
04:12:38.080 --> 04:12:39.110 align:start position:0%
piece in there and just something we can
debate

04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
debate
 
04:12:39.120 --> 04:12:40.150 align:start position:0%
debate
uh

04:12:40.150 --> 04:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
the charities within the executive
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
council district on the facility
 
04:12:44.950 --> 04:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
location will have will be given
 
04:12:44.960 --> 04:12:46.150 align:start position:0%
location will have will be given
preference

04:12:46.150 --> 04:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
preference
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh this goes back to some of the earlier
 
04:12:50.150 --> 04:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about who gets who gets
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
choice who gets picked who doesn't get
 
04:12:51.840 --> 04:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
choice who gets picked who doesn't get
picked

04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
picked
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh there's some guidance here that says
 
04:12:57.510 --> 04:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
for these machines that within a within
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
a executive council district
 
04:12:59.680 --> 04:13:00.710 align:start position:0%
a executive council district
that

04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
they would get preference over other
 
04:13:02.880 --> 04:13:06.070 align:start position:0%
they would get preference over other
charities

04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
again the point is that we have a very
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
long list of charities that want to get
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
and if you've seen from all the mail
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
you've been getting
 
04:13:17.110 --> 04:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the terrible locations really
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
do appreciate that we have this form of
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
operation to help their charities out
 
04:13:26.229 --> 04:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
and of course the only reason i i
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
support this let's not forget the
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
chairman of gaming also supports
 
04:13:29.760 --> 04:13:31.189 align:start position:0%
chairman of gaming also supports
education

04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
the majority of what the state gets
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
winds up going into the uh the education
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
so let's do the math this is the for
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
it takes you a while when you read it to
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
figure it out i i had a call
 
04:13:47.910 --> 04:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre back twice to say do i
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
have this right
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
the licensee commission meaning the
 
04:13:55.189 --> 04:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
owner of the charitable location
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
on all historic race parry mutual pools
 
04:13:59.910 --> 04:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
shall be at a rate
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
not greater than 12 percent
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
so that means the the organizations that
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
run it will well off the top take 12
 
04:14:07.439 --> 04:14:09.670 align:start position:0%
run it will well off the top take 12
percent

04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's in statutes not to exceed 12
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
it could be anywhere 12 or less
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
when i talked to
 
04:14:21.030 --> 04:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre he said the odds are
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to be set around 10 percent
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
by but the individual location sets
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
their own level
 
04:14:29.110 --> 04:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh more than likely it's going to be 10
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh so probably anywhere between 10 and
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
12. but for sake of argument let's just
 
04:14:35.349 --> 04:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
say it's 12 at 12 it can't be any higher
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
than that
 
04:14:38.469 --> 04:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
so that means 88
 
04:14:40.469 --> 04:14:40.479 align:start position:0%
would go back of the winnings would go
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
back to the players
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
so how much did the charities in the
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
state get
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
so of the 12
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
25 percent of that goes to the charities
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
and to the state
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
so that's a pot
 
04:14:55.439 --> 04:14:56.149 align:start position:0%
so that's a pot
so

04:14:56.149 --> 04:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:57.189 --> 04:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
of that
 
04:14:57.199 --> 04:14:58.010 align:start position:0%
of that
25

04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
25
 
04:14:58.020 --> 04:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
25
[Music]

04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:59.279 --> 04:15:00.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
these

04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
the charities get 35
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the state gets 65 of the 25 percent
 
04:15:09.830 --> 04:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
so when we have more sessions we can we
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
can talk this one to death but uh i can
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
explain it
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
when we're doing work sessions a little
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
more if there's confusion on that one
 
04:15:20.950 --> 04:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
but again that means that
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund gets a good
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
then there's two other money things
 
04:15:32.229 --> 04:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
if you go to section 5 of the bill roman
 
04:15:32.239 --> 04:15:33.510 align:start position:0%
if you go to section 5 of the bill roman
five

04:15:33.510 --> 04:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:15:35.110 --> 04:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read this
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh 100 of the of the odd sense of all
 
04:15:40.950 --> 04:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
redistribution based on each dollar
 
04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
wager exceeding the sum equal to the
 
04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
next lowest multiple of 10 known as
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
breakage like i could just said breakage
 
04:15:51.349 --> 04:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
and we can have a conversation about
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
what breakage is
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
shall be paid to the lottery commission
 
04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
and used as payment for problem
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
gaming gaming so that's where
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
the money's going to come from to uh
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
into the into the problem gaming fun
 
04:16:09.429 --> 04:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
then also there's another section five
 
04:16:11.670 --> 04:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
roman five of the bell
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
section nine
 
04:16:15.030 --> 04:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
i was gonna excuse me section nine of
 
04:16:16.149 --> 04:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:16:19.110 --> 04:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
talks about unclaimed tickets to go to
 
04:16:23.590 --> 04:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
special fund rsa 284 coleman 21j
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
but i understand what that is
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
all of lottery and charitable gaming
 
04:16:29.520 --> 04:16:30.469 align:start position:0%
all of lottery and charitable gaming
uh

04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
revenues go into this fund
 
04:16:33.920 --> 04:16:34.870 align:start position:0%
revenues go into this fund
uh

04:16:34.870 --> 04:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
what happens is
 
04:16:40.070 --> 04:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
at some point in time
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
that money is trans anything that's
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
expenses for running the lottery come
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
out of that okay so after the expenses
 
04:16:48.070 --> 04:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
come out of that fund
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
the rest of it goes to the education
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund so basically it's saying it's
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
pointed there
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
the lottery
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
takes out its expense and then the rest
 
04:16:56.880 --> 04:16:57.830 align:start position:0%
takes out its expense and then the rest
goes

04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
goes
 
04:17:00.389 --> 04:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the education trends fund and that's
 
04:17:02.149 --> 04:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
the number when we do our estimates
 
04:17:04.149 --> 04:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's the number that we we see that
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.439 --> 04:17:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully everyone got this that there
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
was a fiscal note uh
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
i asked uh i didn't see mine being sent
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
to me directly so i asked web center
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
major to forward it to everybody this
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
morning hopefully you got it
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
so lottery is these the fiscal note came
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
from lottery itself
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
they estimate between 5.7 and 5.8
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
million will go to the charities
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
a little over 12 million will go to the
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh to lottery
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
which means majority of that is is is
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
going to the education trust fund
 
04:17:44.389 --> 04:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh by the way that number includes the
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
unclaimed tickets that i had mentioned
 
04:17:46.319 --> 04:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
unclaimed tickets that i had mentioned
before

04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
and then they estimated another 820
 
04:17:54.070 --> 04:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
000 goes to the probably problem gaming
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
gaming uh activities uh than that from
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
so these are pretty big numbers
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh and this is why i support this bill
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
i think we really really need to
 
04:18:07.199 --> 04:18:08.229 align:start position:0%
i think we really really need to
uh

04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
think about how we're going to support
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
our charities more
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh just something uniquely in new
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm going to get to that
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
in a minute
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
the one thing i forgot to mention is
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned that you need a
 
04:18:23.910 --> 04:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
operator's license under rsa287-d
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
a game operator
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
meaning you have to own all these
 
04:18:26.560 --> 04:18:28.389 align:start position:0%
meaning you have to own all these
facilities

04:18:28.389 --> 04:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
but for if you're going to install these
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
machines in your facility you also need
 
04:18:35.830 --> 04:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
a peri mutual wagering license under rsa
 
04:18:35.840 --> 04:18:37.429 align:start position:0%
a peri mutual wagering license under rsa
284

04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
284
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason we put that in there
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
is that the background checks
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
are even more stringent than to get a
 
04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
license to be a terrible
 
04:18:50.710 --> 04:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
location so it's it's it's the same
 
04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
same background check that you get as if
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
you were you're running a racetrack
 
04:18:57.750 --> 04:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to i wanted to emphasize
 
04:18:57.760 --> 04:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to i wanted to emphasize
that

04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:00.149 --> 04:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to go through some of the
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
other sections very quickly i'll mention
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
them to you
 
04:19:06.309 --> 04:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
if you go to section two of the bill
 
04:19:08.229 --> 04:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
insurance historic racing machines are
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
programmed and operated
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
for perimeter wagering only
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of machines are based on random
 
04:19:17.110 --> 04:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
number generator these machines are not
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
based on that they are based on pairing
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
mutual racing of rebellion totally
 
04:19:21.920 --> 04:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
mutual racing of rebellion totally
different

04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
and when i say that they're playing
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
against others betting and not betting
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
on the house when you're when you're
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
betting on regular gambling you're
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
defending against the house with these
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
machines you're betting against others
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
that are playing very important piece to
 
04:19:37.439 --> 04:19:39.830 align:start position:0%
that are playing very important piece to
remember

04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
section 5 roman 2
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
limits applicants for
 
04:19:43.680 --> 04:19:44.790 align:start position:0%
limits applicants for
license

04:19:44.790 --> 04:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
for these machines to to those who
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh who have game operational or greater
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
licenses to conduct terrible gaming as
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
of may first 2020.
 
04:19:56.950 --> 04:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about that and also let's
 
04:19:58.870 --> 04:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
look at section 10 and 11 at the same
 
04:19:58.880 --> 04:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
look at section 10 and 11 at the same
time

04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:20:02.790 --> 04:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
open up historic racing to others
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
on july 1st 2024
 
04:20:09.110 --> 04:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to read why
 
04:20:11.110 --> 04:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
this is in the meantime i want to say
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
this in the meantime it doesn't stop
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who qualifies
 
04:20:16.070 --> 04:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
to gain a
 
04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
a game operator license to open up a new
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming facility
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
but they must wait until july 1st 2024
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
to also have a historic racing license
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
the reason we did that
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
is that we wanted to make sure
 
04:20:32.399 --> 04:20:33.429 align:start position:0%
is that we wanted to make sure
that

04:20:33.429 --> 04:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:33.439 --> 04:20:34.309 align:start position:0%
that
we

04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have facilities opening just
 
04:20:37.990 --> 04:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
to have these machines
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
we wanted to we wanted to make sure that
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
that that didn't happen and that that
 
04:20:44.229 --> 04:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
was the logic so we were delaying a
 
04:20:46.070 --> 04:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
04:20:47.510 --> 04:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh to allow
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
any other facilities to use these
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
machines other than the 15 that that
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
exist or anybody who decides to get
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
licensed before may 1st uh well
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
we're in 2021 anybody who's licensed as
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
of may 1st 2020.
 
04:21:08.309 --> 04:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:12.149 --> 04:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh uh section five roman three
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
individual wages are capped at twenty
 
04:21:15.510 --> 04:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
five dollars
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
also in that section each licensee to
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
have a responsible gaming plan
 
04:21:23.349 --> 04:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh that was also part of the uh problem
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
gaming discussion we had last term that
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure that these
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
facilities have a responsible gaming
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
plan that they can enact if they feel
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
someone is abusing their what they're
 
04:21:35.189 --> 04:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
doing with gambling
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh section 5 roman 4
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
employees or owners of companies
 
04:21:47.110 --> 04:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
that are involved with the hardware
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
software not be allowed to play in new
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i think that's
 
04:21:50.800 --> 04:21:53.269 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i think that's
self-explanatory

04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh section five roman
 
04:21:55.680 --> 04:21:56.710 align:start position:0%
uh section five roman
uh

04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:56.720 --> 04:21:57.910 align:start position:0%
uh
six

04:21:57.910 --> 04:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh rule making authority of the lottery
 
04:22:02.229 --> 04:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
okay that's self-explanatory section
 
04:22:02.239 --> 04:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
okay that's self-explanatory section
five

04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
7 historic racing machines can only be
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
utilized when other charitable gaming
 
04:22:10.710 --> 04:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
games are being offered
 
04:22:13.110 --> 04:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
and i think uh what we did there is we
 
04:22:14.630 --> 04:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make sure that if channel
 
04:22:14.640 --> 04:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make sure that if channel
gaming

04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
facility closed
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
their you know game other games of
 
04:22:19.520 --> 04:22:20.630 align:start position:0%
their you know game other games of
chance

04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
chance
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh at nine o'clock
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
that they weren't allowed to stay open
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
till midnight or using these machines
 
04:22:27.840 --> 04:22:30.389 align:start position:0%
till midnight or using these machines
only

04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
all right so those are some of the major
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
components of the of the bill
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we're going to have a a work
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
session or two on this on this
 
04:22:42.550 --> 04:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
let me tell you what the argument's
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:22:44.950 --> 04:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
you've been there before
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know we can hear historic racing
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
machines and slot machines
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
and my argument's going to be
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
not true
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
you're never going to find a casino that
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
has these machines because they're too
 
04:22:56.479 --> 04:22:57.910 align:start position:0%
has these machines because they're too
slow

04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
slow
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear probably someone's
 
04:23:01.269 --> 04:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
gonna talk about the recent kentucky
 
04:23:01.279 --> 04:23:02.710 align:start position:0%
gonna talk about the recent kentucky
ruling

04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh and let's see kentucky's not even
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
donate but that's not true
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding about that that
 
04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
that ruling was it was a turf battle
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
between agencies in kentucky
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that if if you look right now
 
04:23:17.349 --> 04:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
kentucky still is using these these
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we're going to have some
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
discussion about the quick play feature
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the machine
 
04:23:23.840 --> 04:23:25.349 align:start position:0%
of the machine
um

04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i don't want to do it today
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
but uh when we're in our work session we
 
04:23:30.309 --> 04:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
could talk about
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh that there's expanding support out
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
there for charitable gaming
 
04:23:34.479 --> 04:23:35.590 align:start position:0%
there for charitable gaming
uh

04:23:35.590 --> 04:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
in recent polls
 
04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're probably gonna debate about
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh the delay
 
04:23:43.990 --> 04:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
of not allowing new machine machines in
 
04:23:47.269 --> 04:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to listen to those debates
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh we may even have a debate on the pet
 
04:23:51.510 --> 04:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
limit um
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
and the other question is really is this
 
04:23:59.110 --> 04:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
a viable way to support our charities in
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
what's going to back up two more
 
04:24:10.790 --> 04:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
years about 20 minutes you have much
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
more to go well given i i yeah i got two
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
more comments
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
two more comments okay
 
04:24:20.800 --> 04:24:21.910 align:start position:0%
two more comments okay
uh

04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
well it's a complicated bill i mean it
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
isn't like some of these other bills
 
04:24:26.950 --> 04:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
there were two lions so
 
04:24:26.960 --> 04:24:28.149 align:start position:0%
there were two lions so
uh

04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:28.159 --> 04:24:29.189 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
big big picture
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
large destination casinos are never
 
04:24:34.710 --> 04:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
gonna happen
 
04:24:35.990 --> 04:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
it had a chance ten years ago
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
with the closing of rockingham park
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
which was the only logical place to have
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
destination casino
 
04:24:47.110 --> 04:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to find chair
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
any kind of casino pass in this state is
 
04:24:49.680 --> 04:24:50.469 align:start position:0%
any kind of casino pass in this state is
my

04:24:50.469 --> 04:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's my humble opinion
 
04:24:54.630 --> 04:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
so now is the time to let's support the
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
model that we have
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
that supports charities and education
 
04:25:03.830 --> 04:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
this is a model unique to new hampshire
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
if we had large-scale
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh casinos coming here
 
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of those monies would leave our
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
state and go to
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
and go to
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
nevada go to vegas by the big companies
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
that used to bid on these things
 
04:25:16.960 --> 04:25:17.750 align:start position:0%
that used to bid on these things
so

04:25:17.750 --> 04:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
let's support what we have i i agree
 
04:25:22.309 --> 04:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
with our discussion earlier that we
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
should we should tighten up our
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
regulations absolutely
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
and one final thing uh we're going to
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
have the discussion i'm sure on
 
04:25:33.120 --> 04:25:34.469 align:start position:0%
have the discussion i'm sure on
committee

04:25:34.469 --> 04:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
and this is something that the
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
commission is also going to be looking
 
04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
at that we're probably going to be
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
also in the packet i i sent to everybody
 
04:25:47.189 --> 04:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
was a pie chart
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
and this is the breakout of a hundred
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars bet
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh ninety two dollars goes back to the
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
player two dollars and fifty cents uh
 
04:25:56.229 --> 04:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
the cost of the machines and all the
 
04:25:58.149 --> 04:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
hookups with the total later riser and
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
all that
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
two to two dollars and forty cents city
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh for operating expenses to having the
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
building the electricity whatever
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
two dollars goes to the charity of the
 
04:26:10.309 --> 04:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
state and the dollar ten goes to the
 
04:26:11.830 --> 04:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
operator share
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
meaning the owners of the facility
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh as profit but remembering that
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
some of that goes back into capital
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
improvements that they reinvest in their
 
04:26:20.560 --> 04:26:22.070 align:start position:0%
improvements that they reinvest in their
facilities

04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i uh
 
04:26:25.830 --> 04:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'm looking forward to our discussion in
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to take any questions you
 
04:26:29.040 --> 04:26:30.550 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to take any questions you
have

04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%

04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony

representative romney questions from the
committee

04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
operator share
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
oh for somebody on the line that could
 
04:27:04.469 --> 04:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
help us with this
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
can you give us a definition of our
 
04:27:08.900 --> 04:27:08.910 align:start position:0%
example capital improvement costs
 
04:27:08.910 --> 04:27:10.870 align:start position:0%
example capital improvement costs
[Music]

04:27:10.870 --> 04:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying that that is the profit
 
04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
to the order that to the to the uh
 
04:27:14.880 --> 04:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
to the order that to the to the uh
facility

04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that are on these
 
04:27:17.520 --> 04:27:19.189 align:start position:0%
organizations that are on these
locations

04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
locations
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
but what they what they do is they they
 
04:27:23.110 --> 04:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
put that money in their pocket
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
or they
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
they take some of that money and
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
reinvest it in
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know uh better ambiance better
 
04:27:32.710 --> 04:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
equipment better whatever
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
so that that's what that means follow up
 
04:27:37.030 --> 04:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman follow up
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh then
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
you talk about them putting the money in
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
their pocket what percentage the
 
04:27:43.750 --> 04:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
operator's share of a dollar ten goes
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
into a separate account
 
04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
for capital cost
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
capital improvement cost so that salary
 
04:27:51.439 --> 04:27:52.830 align:start position:0%
capital improvement cost so that salary
wages

04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
wages
 
04:27:55.110 --> 04:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
etc uh
 
04:27:57.269 --> 04:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
are not being co-mingled
 
04:27:59.110 --> 04:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
is there a separate account
 
04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
no there is there isn't a second account
 
04:28:02.389 --> 04:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
no it's going into the pocket and that's
 
04:28:02.399 --> 04:28:04.870 align:start position:0%
no it's going into the pocket and that's
it

04:28:04.870 --> 04:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.710 --> 04:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
but that's but that's the that's what's
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
left it that that's the amount that's
 
04:28:11.189 --> 04:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
left by after subtracting out all the
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
other costs that is what's left
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh and out of that if if they wanted to
 
04:28:19.110 --> 04:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
enhance their facility
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
where does that money come from
 
04:28:23.110 --> 04:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
and it comes out of the owner's
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
pocket i'm saying that that's that's the
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
piece that
 
04:28:29.110 --> 04:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
instead of putting it in their pocket
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
it would go to
 
04:28:30.800 --> 04:28:31.670 align:start position:0%
it would go to
uh

04:28:31.670 --> 04:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
they would bear the expense of
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh enhancing the facility or making it
 
04:28:35.600 --> 04:28:36.710 align:start position:0%
uh enhancing the facility or making it
better

04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%

04:29:20.159 --> 04:29:21.269 align:start position:0%
you know all electricity
uh

04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%

uh
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
which also is part of their capital
 
04:29:32.550 --> 04:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
improvement plan
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
if they have one
 
04:29:37.750 --> 04:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i got these estimates from
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
they took a survey of all of the
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
existing locations
 
04:29:47.349 --> 04:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
and that's where we got these numbers
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
from these are the numbers that they
 
04:29:48.800 --> 04:29:49.910 align:start position:0%
from these are the numbers that they
shared

04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
shared
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
with us
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
and again
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that
 
04:29:57.590 --> 04:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think this
 
04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee can handle is between now and
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
the time we have to vote this bill but
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh when we have the
 
04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
if we pass the bill on the uh
 
04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
i i think this is something that uh
 
04:30:10.469 --> 04:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
representative ames is looking to take a
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
look at as well
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:30:17.920 --> 04:30:20.149 align:start position:0%
okay uh
representing

04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
representing
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative abrami for all
 
04:30:27.510 --> 04:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
your diligent work hard work on this um
 
04:30:29.110 --> 04:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
you you talked about a few things and
 
04:30:30.389 --> 04:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep this very brief
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
because i know we have a lot of people
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
that want to uh
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
submit testimony but you talked a bit
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
about what some of the opponents will be
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
bringing up when we hear these these
 
04:30:40.000 --> 04:30:41.269 align:start position:0%
bringing up when we hear these these
arguments

04:30:41.269 --> 04:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
arguments
 
04:30:43.269 --> 04:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
to pass this legislation you spoke
 
04:30:44.790 --> 04:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
specifically about the argument that
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
these are slot machines
 
04:30:49.189 --> 04:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
would you agree that
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the opponents to this legislation have
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
made that argument
 
04:30:53.359 --> 04:30:54.790 align:start position:0%
made that argument
and

04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
would you also agree or would you
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
disagree with the fact that uh hhr uh
 
04:31:01.349 --> 04:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing is completely
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
different from any kind of uh existing
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
electronic games they
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to make that argument that
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is a different component we already
 
04:31:10.800 --> 04:31:11.830 align:start position:0%
this is a different component we already
have

04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
electronic games in the state visa the
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
lucky 7 machines kino now the sports
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
betting kiosks
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
the way it was described in the way it
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
could be best described is that this is
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
another component for the charities to
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
benefit from as a matter of fact in your
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation you built in a
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
component that adds charities to this
 
04:31:34.870 --> 04:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
the the one argument and and we can get
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
into the specifics of of these
 
04:31:39.269 --> 04:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
definitively not being slot machines
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
because they are in fact not slot
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
machines and we and we heard that
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
testimony from charlie mcintyre last
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
biennium along with others
 
04:31:47.760 --> 04:31:48.550 align:start position:0%
biennium along with others
um

04:31:48.550 --> 04:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:50.070 --> 04:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
the one thing he didn't miss is the
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
argument that seems to keep arising here
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
in relation to gaming addiction
 
04:31:56.000 --> 04:31:56.950 align:start position:0%
in relation to gaming addiction
um

04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
and and these are unfounded
 
04:31:58.960 --> 04:32:01.189 align:start position:0%
and and these are unfounded
unsubstantiated

04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
yet uh
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
perpetual attempts
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:32:09.189 --> 04:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
to derail
 
04:32:12.229 --> 04:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
this uh simple addition to a charitable
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
gaming base the revenues that these
 
04:32:17.349 --> 04:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
charities get and more importantly that
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
the end recipients from these charities
 
04:32:19.920 --> 04:32:20.710 align:start position:0%
the end recipients from these charities
get

04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:32:20.720 --> 04:32:23.349 align:start position:0%
get
um

04:32:23.349 --> 04:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
is there a question of this excuse me uh
 
04:32:28.710 --> 04:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
mr chairman chairman of this committee
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me i am asking a question
 
04:32:42.550 --> 04:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.389 --> 04:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
these unfounded allegations of addiction
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
perpetuate and continue to perpetuate
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.309 --> 04:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
submitting these to charities and others
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
as we work towards us would you believe
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i would believe that
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
let's let's face it if you go around
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
new england
 
04:33:06.959 --> 04:33:08.070 align:start position:0%
new england
uh

04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
all those states with the exception of
 
04:33:09.600 --> 04:33:11.029 align:start position:0%
all those states with the exception of
vermont

04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
04:33:11.039 --> 04:33:12.070 align:start position:0%
vermont
has

04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
has some kind of gaming
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
vermonters lottery i imagine but
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
all the other states have have true
 
04:33:18.799 --> 04:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
all the other states have have true
casinos

04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
casinos
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
with real slot machines
 
04:33:24.470 --> 04:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
these aren't real slot machines they
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
aren't slot machines
 
04:33:27.910 --> 04:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
they may look like them a little bit but
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
the betting is the mutual it's not based
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
on a random number generator and the
 
04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
player actually has the ability to
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
change the outcome of his bet you you if
 
04:33:39.830 --> 04:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
you pay attention to the form that you
 
04:33:39.840 --> 04:33:40.709 align:start position:0%
you pay attention to the form that you
have

04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're making an intelligent bet
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
not based on some random number
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
generator whether you're lucky or not
 
04:33:46.561 --> 04:33:47.429 align:start position:0%
generator whether you're lucky or not
so

04:33:47.429 --> 04:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
yeah i i
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
we were the first state in the nation to
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
have lottery
 
04:33:53.520 --> 04:33:54.709 align:start position:0%
have lottery
uh

04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
so i i think it and in this bill we have
 
04:33:59.349 --> 04:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
plenty of spots where we include money
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
to go to problem gambling and to have
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
also to have the
 
04:34:03.359 --> 04:34:04.230 align:start position:0%
also to have the
uh

04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%

04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
the uh the plan
 
04:34:06.240 --> 04:34:07.189 align:start position:0%
the uh the plan
uh

04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:07.199 --> 04:34:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh
if

04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
in place if uh the facility sees
 
04:34:12.949 --> 04:34:12.959 align:start position:0%
somebody who is uh abusing
 
04:34:12.959 --> 04:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
somebody who is uh abusing
uh

04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%

packet in front of me i'm looking at
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
your pie chart
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
where 100
 
04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
of wages goes and i just want to take

one tiny little section of that the very
 
04:34:39.680 --> 04:34:40.869 align:start position:0%
one tiny little section of that the very
first

04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh piece that says two dollars
 
04:34:47.670 --> 04:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
and it says it looks like charity slash
 
04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
state does that mean that that two
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
dollars is split between of the day the
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
charity and the state so that's a that's
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh what split
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
35 goes to the charity
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
65 goes to the state okay
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
04:35:04.719 --> 04:35:07.109 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
yes

04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
of of the charity that you say 35 cent
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
goes to charity so that 35 is then split
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
between the two charities of the day
 
04:35:16.799 --> 04:35:17.990 align:start position:0%

uh the charities

uh the charities
were

04:35:33.429 --> 04:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%

racetrack in salem new hampshire
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
the way i understand this bill now
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
totally different situation
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
where the
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
lottery commission is the one that
 
04:35:50.799 --> 04:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
lottery commission is the one that
chooses

04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
chooses
 
04:35:53.990 --> 04:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
the various charities that we're going
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
to be receiving funds
 
04:36:00.629 --> 04:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay i i rely on
 
04:36:06.470 --> 04:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre for this he's on the
 
04:36:07.590 --> 04:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
line he'll
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
when we get to charlie
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
ask that question please
 
04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
right we'll have chad take care of that
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
he'll explain
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
it be helpful to him explain how it
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
works now
 
04:36:21.189 --> 04:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of who gets who gets the slot
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
and who doesn't and what we're going to
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
do with this new bill is to i think
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some rule making
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
involved in this as well
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
let's hold that off to
 
04:36:31.600 --> 04:36:32.551 align:start position:0%
let's hold that off to
uh

04:36:32.551 --> 04:36:32.561 align:start position:0%

04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%

charlie mcintyre thank you
representative

04:36:35.349 --> 04:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
and represent a lot
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
may i interject for a moment there's
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
some background noise in the lob
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
i don't know if some some microphones
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
might help
 
04:36:54.160 --> 04:36:55.590 align:start position:0%
might help
yeah

04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:36:57.429 --> 04:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
they looked at each other and that they
 
04:36:57.439 --> 04:37:09.269 align:start position:0%
they looked at each other and that they
yes

04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
i want to point out uh one thing you
 
04:37:16.390 --> 04:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
know we heard that uh these are not slot
 
04:37:18.629 --> 04:37:18.639 align:start position:0%
machines because you won't see historic
 
04:37:20.310 --> 04:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
machines in casinos
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that casinos don't
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
have these machines because they do have
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
slot machines
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
and this may actually further
 
04:37:32.310 --> 04:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that these historic horse
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
racing machines which kentucky ruling
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%
says are slot machines are used where
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
slot machines are not explicitly allowed
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
so if you can't have one you have the
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
other they are competing in the same
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
gaming space
 
04:37:46.470 --> 04:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think that further demonstrates a
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
point now that's not to say for or
 
04:37:53.109 --> 04:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.119 --> 04:37:54.150 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think if we're having an honest
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
conversation we say these these behave
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
an awful lot when they're used as the
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
autoplay feature and the quick pick they
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
have an awful lot
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
like a slot machine
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's why we should treat it uh
 
04:38:11.429 --> 04:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
accordingly and with the same level of
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
concern that we have for slot machines
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't allow those in the
 
04:38:15.359 --> 04:38:16.390 align:start position:0%
because we don't allow those in the
state

04:38:16.390 --> 04:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%

next presenter and that is
representative

04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:20.949 --> 04:39:20.959 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but i've never had somebody
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
talk about most of the things he thinks
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
that are going to be said in opposition
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
to this bill before
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
the testimony was finished
 
04:39:29.600 --> 04:39:36.789 align:start position:0%
the testimony was finished
um

04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.799 --> 04:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
i want to start by on giving people the
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
history of
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
on at least recent in the last 50 years
 
04:39:46.878 --> 04:39:47.590 align:start position:0%
on at least recent in the last 50 years
of

04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
gambling in this state
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 40 years
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
on we had something called tr trap monte
 
04:39:58.230 --> 04:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
carlo nights
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
on they were
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming uh they were traveling
 
04:40:04.708 --> 04:40:04.718 align:start position:0%
circuses they went
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
on at least for the smaller towns like
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
mine mine was a town back then
 
04:40:10.080 --> 04:40:11.110 align:start position:0%
mine mine was a town back then
and

04:40:11.110 --> 04:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
they they would come one night or two
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
nights during the year
 
04:40:15.200 --> 04:40:16.708 align:start position:0%
nights during the year
usually

04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
usually
 
04:40:19.030 --> 04:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
every six months in my town and they
 
04:40:21.510 --> 04:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
would rent a hall and
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
they would set up all of the machines
 
04:40:24.240 --> 04:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
they would set up all of the machines
that

04:40:25.030 --> 04:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
you see in normal charitable gaming now
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
on and people would come and play
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh i i think it was a single charity in
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the town would get part of the proceeds
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
and the local police had the oversight i
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
think there must have been uh a
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
select board approval
 
04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
when they came
 
04:40:46.160 --> 04:40:47.990 align:start position:0%
when they came
on

04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
came in because of two tiny bills that
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
were put in
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
in edna when suddenly all of the
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
gambling bills were sent over there
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 12 years ago
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
on and
 
04:41:07.440 --> 04:41:08.310 align:start position:0%
on and
that

04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:10.628 --> 04:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
removed the monte carlo nights and
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
replaced it with
 
04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
the ability for
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
operators to set up large sites around
 
04:41:20.788 --> 04:41:20.798 align:start position:0%
the state most of them ended up in the
 
04:41:22.708 --> 04:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
south of the state where the population
 
04:41:22.718 --> 04:41:24.230 align:start position:0%
south of the state where the population
is

04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
owned by private individuals who were
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
doling out nights to charities as people
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned according to
 
04:41:32.160 --> 04:41:33.590 align:start position:0%
mentioned according to
providing

04:41:33.590 --> 04:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
providing
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
friendly natives i think
 
04:41:36.080 --> 04:41:37.270 align:start position:0%
friendly natives i think
uh

04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
around them
 
04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
but they could solicit and they did
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh at least early on i don't know now uh
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
they they would solicit charities from
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
all over the state they had the power to
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:42:03.270 --> 04:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
on gradually as they did this they
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
incorporated and
 
04:42:05.280 --> 04:42:06.948 align:start position:0%
incorporated and
killed

04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
killed
 
04:42:09.430 --> 04:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
the bingo industry
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh within within them i don't know if
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's any bingo halls just bingo left
 
04:42:16.000 --> 04:42:17.750 align:start position:0%
there's any bingo halls just bingo left
on

04:42:17.750 --> 04:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:42:17.760 --> 04:42:19.590 align:start position:0%
on
and

04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:19.600 --> 04:42:21.590 align:start position:0%
and
on

04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:42:21.600 --> 04:42:23.190 align:start position:0%
on
the

04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
and on and
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
under these bills the charities
 
04:42:35.110 --> 04:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
eventually got 35
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
i believe neil kirk insisted on that
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh and of the profit and the state got
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
less cost than
 
04:42:44.080 --> 04:42:44.868 align:start position:0%
less cost than
less

04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
a lesser amount than it cost to regulate
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
the industry
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
the host towns had no say in whether
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
these were set up or not
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
because it was
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
sociable games it was poker
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh some roulette not much some craps not
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
much uh
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
and the bingo
 
04:43:10.798 --> 04:43:12.070 align:start position:0%
and the bingo
section

04:43:12.070 --> 04:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm leaving one out but
 
04:43:14.878 --> 04:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm leaving one out but
uh

04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
so then we came along and we put in keno
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
and sports betting but we put them in
 
04:43:26.310 --> 04:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
the nearly extinct racing statutes
 
04:43:26.320 --> 04:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
the nearly extinct racing statutes
uh

04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
under direct state control by lottery
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
with the towns able to opt in and then
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
opt out again
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to
 
04:43:37.200 --> 04:43:38.150 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to
uh

04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:40.868 --> 04:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
this because these games mostly involve
 
04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
less social interaction
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
and more chances of creating
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we were considering casino
 
04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
bills every term
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:44:00.788 --> 04:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out that uh one of the
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
things we found was that about 70 of the
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
profit of any casino was slot machines
 
04:44:07.280 --> 04:44:08.868 align:start position:0%
profit of any casino was slot machines
um

04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
and probably still is
 
04:44:11.040 --> 04:44:12.628 align:start position:0%
and probably still is
um

04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
and in the largest task force that i
 
04:44:16.868 --> 04:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
think has ever been assembled of state
 
04:44:16.878 --> 04:44:18.310 align:start position:0%
think has ever been assembled of state
legislators

04:44:18.310 --> 04:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
04:44:18.320 --> 04:44:19.750 align:start position:0%
legislators
um

04:44:19.750 --> 04:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
equally divided among pros and cons i
 
04:44:24.788 --> 04:44:24.798 align:start position:0%
think in the end we had
 
04:44:24.798 --> 04:44:26.230 align:start position:0%
think in the end we had
uh

04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:26.240 --> 04:44:27.590 align:start position:0%
uh
one

04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
there were something like
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
50 people there and it came down to to
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
one more vote in favor of killing the
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
one of our disc decisions was to avoid
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
spreading little slots parlors all over
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
the state because they would be really
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
hard to regulate
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
they would raise little money compared
 
04:44:54.878 --> 04:44:56.470 align:start position:0%
they would raise little money compared
to

04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
a big casino
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
and for
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
those of us on the
 
04:45:02.878 --> 04:45:04.470 align:start position:0%
those of us on the
anti-side

04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
anti-side
 
04:45:07.590 --> 04:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
on it would cost dearly in economic
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
losses and social damage due to the
 
04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
increase in addiction from the proximity
 
04:45:13.600 --> 04:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
increase in addiction from the proximity
effect

04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.240 --> 04:45:20.628 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:22.230 --> 04:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
i wanted
 
04:45:24.390 --> 04:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm having
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
trouble reading the notes i rewrote
 
04:45:28.230 --> 04:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
during lunch
 
04:45:28.240 --> 04:45:33.190 align:start position:0%
during lunch
um

04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:43.110 --> 04:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
okay i'll i'll forget that little piece
 
04:45:47.910 --> 04:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh so now you're proposing to solve this
 
04:45:47.920 --> 04:45:49.190 align:start position:0%
uh so now you're proposing to solve this
problem

04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
of not enough money for regulation that
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have with the finance committee
 
04:45:55.040 --> 04:45:56.070 align:start position:0%
we have with the finance committee
on

04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
by putting the most addictive form in
 
04:46:01.350 --> 04:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
in-person gambling
 
04:46:05.190 --> 04:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
slot machines into the little regulated
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh charity gaming framework
 
04:46:08.718 --> 04:46:10.070 align:start position:0%
uh charity gaming framework
and

04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:14.718 --> 04:46:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:46:17.910 --> 04:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
no way to say anything because
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is social
 
04:46:21.840 --> 04:46:22.868 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is social
and

04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't addict much
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.750 --> 04:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes you say it can be played as a very
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
slow horse racing machine
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
that is frustrating to the operator
 
04:46:39.840 --> 04:46:40.868 align:start position:0%
that is frustrating to the operator
because

04:46:40.868 --> 04:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:46:43.670 --> 04:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
he loses money
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
he has to have a lot of bets in order to
 
04:46:49.110 --> 04:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
get his money
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
on he doesn't
 
04:46:50.958 --> 04:46:51.990 align:start position:0%
on he doesn't
gain

04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
gain
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
by winning the bet but he gains by
 
04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
having people playing again and again
 
04:47:01.030 --> 04:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:03.270 --> 04:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the customers find it frustrating
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
because they can't make their selections
 
04:47:09.510 --> 04:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
fast enough to set the bet and end up
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
having the machine set it for them when
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
the machine sets it for them the machine
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
uses that there are pyramid
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
mutual statistics involved but they use
 
04:47:23.670 --> 04:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
random generator statistics to pick the
 
04:47:23.680 --> 04:47:25.030 align:start position:0%
random generator statistics to pick the
races

04:47:25.030 --> 04:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
races
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
on that that the people are going to
 
04:47:27.520 --> 04:47:28.830 align:start position:0%
on that that the people are going to
watch

04:47:28.830 --> 04:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
watch
 
04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
and and i believe that they
 
04:47:35.830 --> 04:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
base whether they win or not on the odds
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
that were current at the time that the
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
game started the race started the
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
original race started
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
so it's a mixture
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that may be why uh
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
kentucky i haven't looked into the
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
kentucky decision but i i did just send
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
everybody a video guide which includes a
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
newscast which i thought was reporting
 
04:48:00.320 --> 04:48:01.190 align:start position:0%
newscast which i thought was reporting
pretty

04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
neutrally on
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
from people who were reacting to the
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
kentucky decision
 
04:48:09.040 --> 04:48:12.708 align:start position:0%
kentucky decision
um

04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.718 --> 04:48:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
what happens is that almost everybody
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's playing these machines sits down
 
04:48:23.030 --> 04:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
at the machine and hits what is usually
 
04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
called autocad
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
that button and that button
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
turns it into a somewhat slow slot
 
04:48:30.718 --> 04:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
turns it into a somewhat slow slot
machine

04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
machine
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
so it isn't
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
competitive with
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
the full slot machines that are in
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or maine
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
but it is on only slightly slow
 
04:48:44.638 --> 04:48:45.830 align:start position:0%
but it is on only slightly slow
slower

04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
slower
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:52.150 --> 04:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
two two seconds instead of a half second
 
04:48:54.788 --> 04:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:00.240 --> 04:49:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:49:01.030 --> 04:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
and so they play that slot machine until
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
they can
 
04:49:09.190 --> 04:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
they are sensible and withdraw
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
or they lose all the money they brought
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
and if they could use a credit card they
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
may just keep going
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
so what is this
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
because we put
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:28.320 --> 04:49:30.150 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
sports betting into racing
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
we are putting
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
this one under charitable gaming which
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
means that towns have never been able to
 
04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
vote and will never be able to vote
 
04:49:42.878 --> 04:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
vote and will never be able to vote
on

04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:49.590 --> 04:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
and i would just like to end by saying
 
04:49:55.270 --> 04:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
that i come from one of the
 
04:49:57.030 --> 04:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
16 towns
 
04:49:57.040 --> 04:49:58.150 align:start position:0%
16 towns
on

04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
in which a
 
04:50:03.750 --> 04:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
a gentleman moved in and put in a poker
 
04:50:03.760 --> 04:50:05.350 align:start position:0%
a gentleman moved in and put in a poker
palace

04:50:05.350 --> 04:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
palace
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
about six months i think before the
 
04:50:09.350 --> 04:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
first bill surfaced
 
04:50:10.708 --> 04:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
he's had a
 
04:50:14.948 --> 04:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
poker games going there i'm
 
04:50:16.868 --> 04:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
not sure whether it was through covet or
 
04:50:18.948 --> 04:50:18.958 align:start position:0%
not but he's still there and there's he
 
04:50:20.788 --> 04:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
still writes this sign on the outside
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
that says casino and i every now and
 
04:50:26.550 --> 04:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
then get a constituent going what
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
is in our town
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i explained to them that they're all
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
calling them casinos now
 
04:50:34.080 --> 04:50:35.030 align:start position:0%
calling them casinos now
on

04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
it it has
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
for a long time i'm not sure whether it
 
04:50:42.868 --> 04:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
is still on lebanon has been changing it
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
has been opposed to this kind of thing
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
it is going to be required to accept it
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the the place that he picked to put
 
04:50:56.230 --> 04:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
it is in the middle of a large number
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
of pretty much all of our subsidized
 
04:51:00.550 --> 04:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
housing for
 
04:51:00.560 --> 04:51:01.750 align:start position:0%
housing for
the

04:51:01.750 --> 04:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
low-income elders
 
04:51:07.350 --> 04:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
for the disabled and for on recovering
 
04:51:07.360 --> 04:51:10.948 align:start position:0%
for the disabled and for on recovering
alcoholics

04:51:10.948 --> 04:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
newly uh newly housed homeless people
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
forgot that one
 
04:51:19.360 --> 04:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
forgot that one
um

04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:20.160 --> 04:51:20.868 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
these these are
 
04:51:25.510 --> 04:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
the groups that cannot do not have a lot
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
to do with their time and are lonely are
 
04:51:29.750 --> 04:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the ones most susceptible to slot
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
machines and most needing watching and
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get watching under
 
04:51:36.788 --> 04:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
this bill as far as i can tell
 
04:51:40.390 --> 04:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
there are any questions for
 
04:51:46.718 --> 04:51:48.708 align:start position:0%
there are any questions for
representative

04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:48.718 --> 04:51:51.110 align:start position:0%
representative
representatives

04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman representative
 
04:51:55.030 --> 04:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
almighty without going deep uh but just
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
bringing out a couple issues here
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
we we talked about um earlier today and
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's been mentioned again and you
 
04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh enforcement and oversight
 
04:52:08.948 --> 04:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
and if i recall correctly uh
 
04:52:10.948 --> 04:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre last
 
04:52:12.788 --> 04:52:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh biennium
 
04:52:12.798 --> 04:52:13.830 align:start position:0%
uh biennium
talked

04:52:13.830 --> 04:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
talked
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the point where
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
machine gaming and i i think he he
 
04:52:20.628 --> 04:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned the lucky seven machines the
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
kino machines
 
04:52:25.350 --> 04:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
and the like he would rather
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
be in charge of those because
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
he did it easier for him to regulate the
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
easier they're harder to manipulate as
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to a uh a blackjack dealer or a
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
polka dealer or anything so i i would uh
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
i would submit that this uh at least
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
charlie mcintyre from lottery's
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh statements last year would would help
 
04:52:52.390 --> 04:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
us in that enforcement and oversight
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
and also you made a statement and i
 
04:52:57.910 --> 04:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
still contend as do many people who
 
04:53:00.470 --> 04:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
understand these machines that these are
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
not slots but you mentioned that
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
these machines have a random generator
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
of some sort and uh you spoke to it
 
04:53:08.560 --> 04:53:09.830 align:start position:0%
of some sort and uh you spoke to it
specifically

04:53:09.830 --> 04:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the races what it is is
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
there is the way it was explained to all
 
04:53:16.230 --> 04:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
of us as a committee there's a pool of
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
races whether that be 200 000 300 000
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
races and yes they are randomly
 
04:53:21.600 --> 04:53:22.788 align:start position:0%
races and yes they are randomly
generated

04:53:22.788 --> 04:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
generated
 
04:53:24.310 --> 04:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
so those
 
04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
patrons can choose the odds and choose
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
the race as to how they want it to
 
04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
finish there is in no way shape or form
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
a random number generator involved with
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
the historic horse racing machine so so
 
04:53:39.990 --> 04:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
can you explain where you got that from
 
04:53:40.000 --> 04:53:41.590 align:start position:0%
can you explain where you got that from
representatives

04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative said
 
04:53:47.430 --> 04:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
is that a form of a question that's what
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
i ask that i want to know where she's
 
04:53:52.390 --> 04:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
getting uh that there's random numbered
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
generators in historic racing machines
 
04:53:54.958 --> 04:53:56.868 align:start position:0%
generators in historic racing machines
okay

04:53:56.868 --> 04:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:00.150 --> 04:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
on yes there are in historic racing
 
04:54:03.270 --> 04:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
machines something has to choose the
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
races that come up at any given time
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
and it is done randomly
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
i explained and i am talking now about
 
04:54:12.480 --> 04:54:13.910 align:start position:0%
i explained and i am talking now about
autocad

04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
autocad
 
04:54:15.910 --> 04:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
when you press the button and you turn
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
it into a semi-slot machine
 
04:54:18.638 --> 04:54:19.750 align:start position:0%
it into a semi-slot machine
on

04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:54:19.760 --> 04:54:20.788 align:start position:0%
on
then

04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the machine picks the race and it did
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
before too
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
but the machine on is the one that
 
04:54:28.560 --> 04:54:29.510 align:start position:0%
but the machine on is the one that
that

04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:31.590 --> 04:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
produces the odds that you're going to
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
use and the odds that you're going to
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
use as i recall with this
 
04:54:41.270 --> 04:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
is the on paramutual odds that were in a
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
place at the time
 
04:54:43.600 --> 04:54:44.708 align:start position:0%
place at the time
that

04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:44.718 --> 04:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
that
on

04:54:45.990 --> 04:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
for the the three
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
winning horses
 
04:54:50.708 --> 04:54:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
04:54:50.718 --> 04:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
uh no
uh

04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:54.550 --> 04:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
the machine i think the the machine uses
 
04:54:54.560 --> 04:54:55.830 align:start position:0%
the machine i think the the machine uses
paramutual

04:54:55.830 --> 04:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
paramutual
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
odds someone else can explain this on to
 
04:54:59.520 --> 04:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
odds someone else can explain this on to
determine

04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
determine
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
on how you're going to bet on that but
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
you aren't determining it you are
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
telling the machine to determine it
 
04:55:10.310 --> 04:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
and at that
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
but at the original point
 
04:55:13.040 --> 04:55:14.310 align:start position:0%
but at the original point
where

04:55:14.310 --> 04:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:55:16.708 --> 04:55:16.718 align:start position:0%
which race you're getting is
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
is a random numbers generator
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair
 
04:55:24.868 --> 04:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
it may be also in the other
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
well what you're describing is a set
 
04:55:31.350 --> 04:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
set of odds in a race that was uh
 
04:55:35.350 --> 04:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
may have taken place 20 30 years ago
 
04:55:37.430 --> 04:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
there was a big difference from a random
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
number generator
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
and a historic race there is no
 
04:55:46.550 --> 04:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh random member gen generation in any
 
04:55:47.670 --> 04:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
machines or they would be slot machines
 
04:55:52.948 --> 04:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
and they are not
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.110 --> 04:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
miss representative
 
04:56:00.390 --> 04:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
what i said
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
was that there is in picking which race
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
04:56:06.628 --> 04:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
when you start playing
 
04:56:10.550 --> 04:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
that is not the odds themselves but
 
04:56:13.110 --> 04:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that there must be some kind
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
of random generator inside
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
because otherwise on
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
when you are in autocad i am not in the
 
04:56:24.390 --> 04:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
horse racing parts of this the horse
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
racing part of this
 
04:56:26.080 --> 04:56:27.110 align:start position:0%
racing part of this
on

04:56:27.110 --> 04:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:56:27.120 --> 04:56:28.230 align:start position:0%
on
is

04:56:28.230 --> 04:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
cancelled by most people when they
 
04:56:34.150 --> 04:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
get on the machine they hit autocad
 
04:56:34.160 --> 04:56:35.030 align:start position:0%
get on the machine they hit autocad
on

04:56:35.030 --> 04:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:56:38.310 --> 04:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
and under that something has to decide
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
what the odds are the person who hit it
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't done that they just keep hitting
 
04:56:44.470 --> 04:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
the button
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay i think the point has been made on
 
04:56:53.910 --> 04:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.310 --> 04:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
who can explain the inside of these
 
04:56:56.320 --> 04:56:57.510 align:start position:0%
who can explain the inside of these
machines

04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
machines
 
04:56:59.670 --> 04:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
but there has to be
 
04:57:01.990 --> 04:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
random in there or else you are cheating
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
is there any more questions for
 
04:57:05.920 --> 04:57:09.990 align:start position:0%
is there any more questions for
representation

04:57:09.990 --> 04:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.000 --> 04:57:10.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
could i just
 
04:57:15.990 --> 04:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
add the part that i'd forgotten on we
 
04:57:18.868 --> 04:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
about eight six eight years ago we put
 
04:57:20.868 --> 04:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
into the law because people kept on
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
saying oh no it's not a slot machine we
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
put into the law that
 
04:57:28.868 --> 04:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
both slot machines and historic horsing
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
racing machines were banned this bill
 
04:57:34.788 --> 04:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
takes out the latter
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
where was that
 
04:57:40.230 --> 04:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's early in the bill i think
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
but we brought that up last time and um
 
04:57:46.470 --> 04:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
and it got into this bill the next time
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:57:47.760 --> 04:57:50.310 align:start position:0%
i mean
um

04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
it's in on

i have nine points about this bill which
 
04:59:55.830 --> 04:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
i hope the committee will
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
despite the arguments of the proponents
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
um house bill 626 cheats the charities
 
05:00:09.590 --> 05:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't have access to this year's
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal note because it came out so
 
05:00:14.230 --> 05:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
recently i just heard about it now
 
05:00:16.868 --> 05:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
but last year's is pretty similar on uh
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1646
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
in round numbers
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
historic racing
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh would produce about six million
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
dollars for the charities
 
05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars for the state and 50
 
05:00:32.550 --> 05:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the operators that's
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
on a gross bet of about 55
 
05:00:39.110 --> 05:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
550 million dollars with 12
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the gross profits divided in the way
 
05:00:43.350 --> 05:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
that i said
 
05:00:45.430 --> 05:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
in percentages the charities are getting
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
nine percent the state's getting 16
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
and the operators are getting 75 percent
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand with those
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
percentages how this bill can be said to
 
05:00:56.878 --> 05:00:57.830 align:start position:0%
percentages how this bill can be said to
be

05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
of benefit to charitable gaming when
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
both the state and the operators get so
 
05:01:05.270 --> 05:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
much more than the charities do indeed
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
in some of the video slot machines bills
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
that we've had in the past the charities
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
were getting 18
 
05:01:14.628 --> 05:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
the state was getting 50
 
05:01:17.910 --> 05:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the operators were only getting 32
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
in other words the charities were
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
getting twice as much
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
as they are now the state was getting
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
three times as much
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the operators were getting
 
05:01:30.550 --> 05:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat less than half as much so if
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
argued as a bill to favor charitable
 
05:01:39.750 --> 05:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
gaming i think the proportions of money
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to charity is much much too low
 
05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
point number two
 
05:01:47.190 --> 05:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why there's no local
 
05:01:49.990 --> 05:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
control um in this bill we've always
 
05:01:51.430 --> 05:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
done that for
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
lotteries uh video slots and others and
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
keno and
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
horse and sports betting we always had a
 
05:02:00.390 --> 05:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
local control element but not here
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why that's the case
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i hope the committee will look into
 
05:02:04.320 --> 05:02:07.190 align:start position:0%
and i hope the committee will look into
that

05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
for many if not most players this is
 
05:02:10.550 --> 05:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
number three
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines act as video
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
slot machines technically they're not
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
but as a practical matter for players
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
they are they're a bit slower
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
than video slot machines but most
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
players are going to have the machine
 
05:02:24.320 --> 05:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
players are going to have the machine
pick

05:02:25.110 --> 05:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
pick
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
their horses for them and you will
 
05:02:30.550 --> 05:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
simply approve the machine's picks takes
 
05:02:32.310 --> 05:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
maybe two seconds
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
um but as a practical matter it acts in
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the speed the excitement and
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
everything that people want from from
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
gaming it acts just like video slot
 
05:02:41.760 --> 05:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
gaming it acts just like video slot
machines

05:02:43.750 --> 05:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
machines
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
if that's not the case here then i think
 
05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
you need to eliminate the machine picks
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
and just make it into a true power
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
mutual game where the player has to bet
 
05:02:54.708 --> 05:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
the odds
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
and and make the bets then it would be
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
different from slot machines
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no limit on the
 
05:03:05.350 --> 05:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
number of slot machines
 
05:03:07.350 --> 05:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
the number of excuse me historic racing
 
05:03:07.360 --> 05:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
the number of excuse me historic racing
machines

05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
machines
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
in effect we're creating 16 mini casinos
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
we've never done that
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think you need to consider whether or
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
not there should be a limit on the
 
05:03:20.310 --> 05:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
number of these machines
 
05:03:20.320 --> 05:03:21.990 align:start position:0%

been 21 years
 
05:04:39.830 --> 05:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
mass maine connecticut 21 years why is
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
it that we're allowing younger people to
 
05:04:45.270 --> 05:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
use these machines
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
number seven
 
05:04:49.590 --> 05:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to take 550 million
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
dollars out of the local economy
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
and put it into these many casinos
 
05:04:57.590 --> 05:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is a significant economic impact on
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
local businesses including restaurants
 
05:05:01.110 --> 05:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
and theaters
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
the committee needs to look carefully as
 
05:05:06.310 --> 05:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
to whether or not this is a desirable
 
05:05:06.320 --> 05:05:07.270 align:start position:0%
to whether or not this is a desirable
way

05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh to have our state's gross domestic
 
05:05:13.110 --> 05:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
product reallocated
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
number eight
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is inadequate regulation of these
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
machines in new hampshire we've got
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
three investigators for 12 facilities
 
05:05:24.150 --> 05:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
versus rhode island which has 32
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
regulators for one facility
 
05:05:29.110 --> 05:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
previous casino bills have had pages of
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
statutory regulation regulators and
 
05:05:31.520 --> 05:05:32.708 align:start position:0%
statutory regulation regulators and
financing

05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
financing
 
05:05:34.230 --> 05:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
i doubt the lottery commission can
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
adequately supervise 550 million dollars
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
of cash going through these sites
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
the bill practically invites fraud the
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
way it's set up to the detriment of
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
charities among others
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire no less
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
nine and finally
 
05:05:54.948 --> 05:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow people to use i
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
believe credit cards unless there's some
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
other way and some other part of the
 
05:06:01.590 --> 05:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
statute that prohibits this
 
05:06:03.110 --> 05:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that this should be a
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
cash-only venture to protect people from
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
getting so involved that they
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
overuse the credit that may be available
 
05:06:12.390 --> 05:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
to them this is an important issue for
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
the important issue for those people who
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
are concerned about problem gaming
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
the bill needs substantial work to deal
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
with these issues mr chairman and if the
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
committee has the time and interest in
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
it should retain the bill or if possible
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
fix it while in committee if not
 
05:06:30.310 --> 05:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the time and you don't
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
believe you can retain the bill then
 
05:06:34.550 --> 05:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
vote the bill itl and have the sponsors
 
05:06:36.390 --> 05:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
revise the bill and submit it again next
 
05:06:36.400 --> 05:06:37.590 align:start position:0%
revise the bill and submit it again next

of the racetrack determined which uh
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%

05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling proceeds
 
05:08:28.560 --> 05:08:29.350 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling proceeds
so

05:08:29.350 --> 05:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:08:32.550 --> 05:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
my question to mr mcintyre is
 
05:08:34.868 --> 05:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
uh is this the
 
05:08:38.550 --> 05:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
now this authority now being uh taken
 
05:08:41.430 --> 05:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
over by the lottery commission
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
does do you
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
or your organizations are you the one
 
05:08:48.550 --> 05:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
that chooses which charities are going
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
05:08:51.750 --> 05:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh think of the question representative
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
the uh the answer is no um we audit the
 
05:08:56.628 --> 05:08:56.638 align:start position:0%
charitable activity uh review it
 
05:08:58.708 --> 05:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
investigate it but we don't choose the
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:03.120 --> 05:09:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
senator

05:09:05.590 --> 05:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just
 
05:09:09.990 --> 05:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
in in brief uh
 
05:09:13.190 --> 05:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
charlie a lot of a lot of people
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the quote unquote kentucky
 
05:09:17.030 --> 05:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
decision today could you give us a
 
05:09:17.040 --> 05:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
decision today could you give us a
little

05:09:17.910 --> 05:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
little
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
a brief on on what you may or may not
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
know about this
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
certainly uh i've reviewed it obviously
 
05:09:25.510 --> 05:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
i went to law school our chief
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
compliance officer has reviewed the case
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh we stole him from the attorney
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
general's office where he was a senior
 
05:09:33.110 --> 05:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
assistant a.g
 
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
we have three attorneys actually in the
 
05:09:37.510 --> 05:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
building probably more than anybody but
 
05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
the ag's office
 
05:09:41.350 --> 05:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
um it relates specifically to an
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
application of the power mutual law of
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
kentucky it doesn't opine as to what a
 
05:09:48.628 --> 05:09:48.638 align:start position:0%
machine is or is not it just says it
 
05:09:50.788 --> 05:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't it didn't fully comport with
 
05:09:52.948 --> 05:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
their pair of mutual laws and john if
 
05:09:54.708 --> 05:09:54.718 align:start position:0%
you want to add something to it
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct i mean this is
 
05:09:59.830 --> 05:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
relating very specifically to what the
 
05:09:59.840 --> 05:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
relating very specifically to what the
kentucky

05:10:01.110 --> 05:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
kentucky
 
05:10:02.708 --> 05:10:02.718 align:start position:0%
what the kentucky definition of
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
paramutual wagering is and how the pools
 
05:10:08.390 --> 05:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
are generated and replenished um so it
 
05:10:10.948 --> 05:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
was a very specific application
 
05:10:12.390 --> 05:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
relating to
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
um power mutual wagering under kentucky
 
05:10:17.190 --> 05:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
law uh not
 
05:10:19.590 --> 05:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
very much applicable to
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
the definition of the type of machine
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
an hhr machine would be whether it would
 
05:10:25.760 --> 05:10:26.550 align:start position:0%
an hhr machine would be whether it would
fit

05:10:26.550 --> 05:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
fit
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
would you identify who it is that just
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
spoke i'm sorry um mr chairman that was
 
05:10:32.628 --> 05:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
john conforty who was our chief
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
compliance officer
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay he previously was with the attorney
 
05:10:37.830 --> 05:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
general's office in his prior life so
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
he's a lawyer um just like me
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
just better hook follow-up mr chair
 
05:10:45.910 --> 05:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
real quick um i wonder
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
a are these machines still in use in
 
05:10:53.990 --> 05:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
kentucky and b was there a ruling as to
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
whether they were slot machines or not
 
05:10:58.948 --> 05:10:58.958 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes they're still abuse in
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
kentucky as as i i'm aware
 
05:11:02.160 --> 05:11:03.670 align:start position:0%
kentucky as as i i'm aware
and

05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the answer is they just didn't comply
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
with the prime mutual law that i don't
 
05:11:08.708 --> 05:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
think the court said that there were
 
05:11:10.708 --> 05:11:10.718 align:start position:0%
slot machines and not slot machines they
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
just said they were not authorized
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
gambling under their mutual law so it's
 
05:11:14.798 --> 05:11:15.510 align:start position:0%
gambling under their mutual law so it's
a

05:11:15.510 --> 05:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fit your question very well
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
charlie i have a question for you yes
 
05:11:24.310 --> 05:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
sir difference between a slot machine
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
and a historic racing machine
 
05:11:27.280 --> 05:11:28.470 align:start position:0%
and a historic racing machine
um

05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
the fundamental difference is the math
 
05:11:33.750 --> 05:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
and the back so if you ask the question
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
if they would and i don't like to use
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
the word slot machine because it's not
 
05:11:39.030 --> 05:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
an accurate description of technology
 
05:11:40.310 --> 05:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
slot machine
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
refers actually to a slot that used to
 
05:11:45.430 --> 05:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
be in 1960s machines so they don't
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
really use that language anymore but to
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:11:49.040 --> 05:11:50.390 align:start position:0%
your question
um

05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's slower
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
version of gambling
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
the winning experience is not the same
 
05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
as a slot machine so the velocity is
 
05:11:58.320 --> 05:11:59.590 align:start position:0%
as a slot machine so the velocity is
slower

05:11:59.590 --> 05:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
slower
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
the winning experience is different
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
because you're winning off of a power
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
mutual you're not winning off of a pay
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
table so
 
05:12:08.150 --> 05:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
i can describe a pig table looks like a
 
05:12:11.670 --> 05:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
pyramid the top prize and then down
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
a historic horse racing machine you win
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
based off the odds of a horse race and
 
05:12:15.920 --> 05:12:16.708 align:start position:0%
based off the odds of a horse race and
so

05:12:16.708 --> 05:12:16.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:18.708 --> 05:12:18.718 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get things like a
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:25.750 --> 05:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
slot machines you're also not going to
 
05:12:28.628 --> 05:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
get a near win which is also very
 
05:12:30.550 --> 05:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
popular in slot machines
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at a tax rate or a
 
05:12:35.510 --> 05:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
commission rate of 25 percent
 
05:12:38.550 --> 05:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
if this was a thousand slot machines
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
the tax rate would be 50 percent and i
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
so and there would be a license fee of
 
05:12:44.788 --> 05:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
20 million and somebody be thrilled to
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
pay it so
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
they're not as economically beneficial
 
05:12:51.510 --> 05:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
or popular so therefore
 
05:12:53.590 --> 05:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's why the percentage is what it is
 
05:12:55.110 --> 05:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
because they're just not as
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you charlie
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative uh
 
05:13:02.240 --> 05:13:03.670 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative uh
bernstein

05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
bernstein
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
hi charlie
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
honorable neil kirk who testified prior
 
05:13:12.070 --> 05:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
said that this bill
 
05:13:16.708 --> 05:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
practically invites fraud
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
how would the lottery
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
ensure that charities get the portion of
 
05:13:22.628 --> 05:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
the proceeds that they're supposed to
 
05:13:22.638 --> 05:13:24.230 align:start position:0%
the proceeds that they're supposed to
get

05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:13:26.150 --> 05:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
not only for historic racing but for
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in general
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
well certainly thank you for the
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
question representative um
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
currently fundamentally there are 10
 
05:13:36.390 --> 05:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
employees who engage
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
almost exclusively on charitable
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
gambling now
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have three investigators but what
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
we did is we hired
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
well soon to be five financial auditors
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
who audited the books of the charities
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
that are the books or the gaming
 
05:13:52.470 --> 05:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
yeah uh operator employers
 
05:13:54.708 --> 05:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
um and what we found we do that because
 
05:13:56.550 --> 05:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'll use the example so the irs when
 
05:13:58.628 --> 05:13:58.638 align:start position:0%
they hire criminal investigators they
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
hire accountants because they're good at
 
05:14:01.670 --> 05:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
counting money
 
05:14:04.070 --> 05:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
similarly we wanted to focus on auditing
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the rooms and making sure the numbers
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
were correct versus investigators who
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
really look for conduct
 
05:14:12.868 --> 05:14:12.878 align:start position:0%
at the facility and so
 
05:14:14.550 --> 05:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
that's one way we beefed up i mean i
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
think we're probably three times more
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
than we were
 
05:14:20.070 --> 05:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
when we inherited this four years ago we
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
didn't inherit it we were told to take
 
05:14:23.590 --> 05:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
it over
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
and also
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.868 --> 05:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
are much easier to audit
 
05:14:32.628 --> 05:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
because you can actually access them in
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
real time through a site control that
 
05:14:37.030 --> 05:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
exists in the facility that we can
 
05:14:39.270 --> 05:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
access through a back office system and
 
05:14:41.430 --> 05:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
review in real time the amount of money
 
05:14:42.868 --> 05:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
in question
 
05:14:45.190 --> 05:14:45.200 align:start position:0%
and really since we've taken this over
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
every single charitable gaming operator
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
has been audited within the last two
 
05:14:48.480 --> 05:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
has been audited within the last two
years

05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a program we installed just
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
recently but we will be doing that on an
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis
 
05:14:57.750 --> 05:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then certainly when we first took
 
05:14:59.270 --> 05:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
this agency over
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
i sent out i think it was 500 subpoenas
 
05:15:04.628 --> 05:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
to everybody that had anything to do at
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
any point in time with every aspect of
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling to try and get all
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the numbers from every aspect of it
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that indeed everyone was
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
getting what they were supposed to do or
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to get
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
and we found that to be the case with
 
05:15:18.788 --> 05:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
very minor discrepancies we found that
 
05:15:23.910 --> 05:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:25.430 --> 05:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative elliott
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman it's the same
 
05:15:27.920 --> 05:15:29.190 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman it's the same
question

05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:31.350 --> 05:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
that i asked and i heard the first half
 
05:15:32.550 --> 05:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the answer
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
i asked who
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
does the lottery commission
 
05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
pick the charities and
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre's answer was no but i didn't
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
hear the second part of it
 
05:15:46.000 --> 05:15:47.110 align:start position:0%
hear the second part of it
if

05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
if he they don't do it who picks the
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
charities that are going to get the
 
05:15:54.868 --> 05:15:54.878 align:start position:0%
money i didn't hear his answer
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative if i wasn't
 
05:15:59.830 --> 05:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
speaking clearly um the operator of the
 
05:16:02.708 --> 05:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
the facility chooses the charities
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
and currently there are waiting lists i
 
05:16:06.868 --> 05:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
think in every facility now
 
05:16:09.190 --> 05:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
to become a charity that benefits from
 
05:16:09.200 --> 05:16:10.470 align:start position:0%
to become a charity that benefits from
this

05:16:10.470 --> 05:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:16:10.480 --> 05:16:13.270 align:start position:0%
this
so

05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
anymore because i think the list is
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
already full
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
that answers the question the operator
 
05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the facility
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
the charity
 
05:16:23.040 --> 05:16:24.070 align:start position:0%
the charity
yes

05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:16:24.080 --> 05:16:27.350 align:start position:0%
yes
over

05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.230 --> 05:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh charlie i know
 
05:16:32.150 --> 05:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
that you can't
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
from your position come out in favor or
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to any particular bill but could
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
you tell us
 
05:16:41.590 --> 05:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
what you feel about
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
the progress we might make
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
with helping out charities by putting
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
this hhs system in
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
i mean represent ober thank you for the
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
question certainly i believe we will
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
increase revenue significantly towards
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
charities and i will tell you as a
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
personal matter as a professional for
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're always fans of technology
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's a whole lot easier to
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
manage than people
 
05:17:09.440 --> 05:17:10.550 align:start position:0%
manage than people
are

05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:17:14.230 --> 05:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
and you know would you
 
05:17:18.788 --> 05:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
any issue you've seen in terms of audits
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
has largely been around people and money
 
05:17:23.270 --> 05:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
but if this technology and as you see in
 
05:17:25.750 --> 05:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
the bill there's testing through a
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
certified laboratory and the ability to
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
randomly test machines will
 
05:17:33.030 --> 05:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's much more manageable than there is
 
05:17:35.350 --> 05:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
sort of people and money that's all so
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're quite comfortable with it
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
saying then we can go back
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
to our
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
testifiers mr chair looks like
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative ducette has his hand up
 
05:17:54.150 --> 05:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:56.230 --> 05:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
sorry about that mr chair and i'll i'll
 
05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
be real brief while we have charlie live
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering if you saw uh the pie
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
chart that representative of brahmi
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh presented in his testimony when he
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
was uh presenting this bill this morning
 
05:18:10.310 --> 05:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
and if those numbers the way they are
 
05:18:11.670 --> 05:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
broken down
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh specific to what percentages go to
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
the state the charities the operator
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
etc if if that drives in your mind
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm curious if you've seen that
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
i have representative thank you for the
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
question uh that's correct yes
 
05:18:28.080 --> 05:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
question uh that's correct yes
um

05:18:29.110 --> 05:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:30.470 --> 05:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
the operator doesn't get to keep all
 
05:18:32.070 --> 05:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that money obviously there's significant
 
05:18:33.990 --> 05:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
capital costs and he has to split it
 
05:18:35.910 --> 05:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
with the machine
 
05:18:37.270 --> 05:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
operator the individual brings the
 
05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
technology in and has to build out the
 
05:18:42.868 --> 05:18:42.878 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um and usually that's not
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
on a ref share basis so the manufacturer
 
05:18:46.708 --> 05:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
of the store horse racing machines it's
 
05:18:48.150 --> 05:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
a percentage of the
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh the the the whole so
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
it's not 75 percent doesn't go to the
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
you're all set representative
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair thank you
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh this this is a question i was i was
 
05:19:18.868 --> 05:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
looking back uh to the previous year and
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:19:22.150 --> 05:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
blurb or
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
report on the bill from
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
ways and means when it came to the floor
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:19:29.910 --> 05:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the blurb uh
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
there's a statement about concern that
 
05:19:32.878 --> 05:19:33.750 align:start position:0%
there's a statement about concern that
uh

05:19:33.750 --> 05:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
the competition from encore
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
05:19:40.150 --> 05:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts the big casino
 
05:19:44.150 --> 05:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh is threatening um charitable revenues
 
05:19:46.628 --> 05:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
and that's that's essentially put
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
forward as one of the reasons for
 
05:19:50.708 --> 05:19:50.718 align:start position:0%
needing to sort of expand the base
 
05:19:52.230 --> 05:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
for um
 
05:19:53.830 --> 05:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
and the proceeds that result from it
 
05:19:58.550 --> 05:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
05:20:00.628 --> 05:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
how is charitable gaming doing these
 
05:20:03.430 --> 05:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
days competition from encore has uh
 
05:20:06.390 --> 05:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
shriveled away so far anyway i think but
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
how are we doing
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly um thank you for the question
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
initially when the encore opened there
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
was a significant loss of charitable
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
gambling revenue um related largely to
 
05:20:18.628 --> 05:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
card games because they had such a large
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
marketing budget unable to sort of
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
entice players down there
 
05:20:25.830 --> 05:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
certainly with covid the mass gaming
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
commission is far more restrictive than
 
05:20:31.430 --> 05:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
related to facilities like that and so
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's hard to draw an accurate comparison
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
of where we are versus them because
 
05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
they are greater restrictions in terms
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
of how many folks can be in the facility
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
how close they can be
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
than we are um certainly so it's
 
05:20:45.670 --> 05:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's an incomplete answer i guess best
 
05:20:47.670 --> 05:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
way to describe it at ames we certainly
 
05:20:50.310 --> 05:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
noticed an impact up front uh and since
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
kovid it's the opposite and i don't know
 
05:20:55.270 --> 05:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
what it looks like postcode
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
okay if i may uh follow up
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
so putting aside encore
 
05:21:03.520 --> 05:21:04.230 align:start position:0%
so putting aside encore
the

05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
question is uh how are revenue i i
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
probably couldn't look this up myself
 
05:21:09.990 --> 05:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
but you're on top of it
 
05:21:10.000 --> 05:21:10.868 align:start position:0%
but you're on top of it
um

05:21:10.868 --> 05:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:15.350 --> 05:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
how is the revenue situation looking
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
for charitable gaming
 
05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
this year will be higher than last year
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
significantly i don't have the number in
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
front of me honestly
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
but i can get that for you if you want
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
and can you explain why that is
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
because they're they'll the sort of the
 
05:21:34.230 --> 05:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
the competition is closed or hat was
 
05:21:34.240 --> 05:21:35.270 align:start position:0%
the competition is closed or hat was
closed

05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
closed
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
materially and
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
and sort of in reality is closed
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
in boston
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
and springfield's too far away
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
um and really oxford is an awkward
 
05:21:46.948 --> 05:21:46.958 align:start position:0%
position to get to
 
05:21:48.708 --> 05:21:48.718 align:start position:0%
even though they sponsor this mile where
 
05:21:51.190 --> 05:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm in you folks the state house are
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
there's not the same dramatic pull to
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
oxford as there is to
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
encore and connecticut
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that when we do research
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
we see those as the facilities folks go
 
05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
to and not oxford maine
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:22:07.520 --> 05:22:10.230 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

05:22:10.230 --> 05:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other hands
 
05:22:12.638 --> 05:22:13.350 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other hands
so

05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:14.550 --> 05:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
we'll go to
 
05:22:17.750 --> 05:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
the next one jerry strangham
 
05:22:17.760 --> 05:22:18.708 align:start position:0%
the next one jerry strangham
a

05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:22:21.510 --> 05:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
former legislator
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
member of the public and representing
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman major uh vice
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
chairman of rami
 
05:22:35.190 --> 05:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
and uh congratulations on your elevation
 
05:22:37.910 --> 05:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
to clerk representative bursting
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
and this is getting to your right it's
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
great to see what the left side of your
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
face actually looks like
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
i see that i got to see your good side
 
05:22:48.550 --> 05:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
but things always look better when you
 
05:22:48.560 --> 05:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
but things always look better when you
look

05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
look
 
05:22:50.788 --> 05:22:50.798 align:start position:0%

and tucker

i think i saw laughlin there earlier too
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
my name is jerry stringham and i'm
 
05:23:09.430 --> 05:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
pleased to have been following the
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
greatest deliberative body in the new
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the great leaders of both parties
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
and uh listen to many things so far i
 
05:23:20.070 --> 05:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
think you're off to a great start
 
05:23:22.150 --> 05:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
i have to say i really appreciate the
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind words
 
05:23:26.470 --> 05:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
at earlier hearings meant a lot to me
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
regarding house bill 626 first of all
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
there was an extensive amount of time
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
spent in the last
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
last biennium on the predecessor bills
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
first let me summarize the difference
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
between historic racing and slots
 
05:23:44.470 --> 05:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
experientially we know there's barely a
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
dime's worth of difference between the
 
05:23:46.240 --> 05:23:47.430 align:start position:0%
dime's worth of difference between the
two

05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
we saw it ourselves on demonstrations
 
05:23:52.150 --> 05:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
that showed this how similar they are
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
it was extensive discussions that
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the equivalent of products
 
05:23:59.270 --> 05:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
with the same unwanted addictive
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
properties as slots
 
05:24:03.350 --> 05:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is a backdoor effort to infiltrate
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
our state with many casinos
 
05:24:10.230 --> 05:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh that's just what uh i see it as
 
05:24:13.680 --> 05:24:15.270 align:start position:0%
uh that's just what uh i see it as
um

05:24:15.270 --> 05:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh if you do wanna move forward with
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
slot like machines
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh the economics of the arrangements in
 
05:24:25.270 --> 05:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
this bill are horrible
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
with this bill the state
 
05:24:29.190 --> 05:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
state is gaining a small percentage as
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
you heard about 16 percent of the take
 
05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
the charity is about 9
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
it's a bad deal for our states and
 
05:24:39.670 --> 05:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
charities uh charlie mcintyre uh last
 
05:24:42.150 --> 05:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
biennium and direct answered a question
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh indicated that offered a contract
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
bid for slots he would get a substantial
 
05:24:46.878 --> 05:24:47.670 align:start position:0%
bid for slots he would get a substantial
fee

05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
fee
 
05:24:49.750 --> 05:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
plus about 55 percent of the take he
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
said pretty much the same thing here
 
05:24:51.440 --> 05:24:52.390 align:start position:0%
said pretty much the same thing here
today

05:24:52.390 --> 05:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:24:54.550 --> 05:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
i did look up in maryland's slot
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
percentage is 61
 
05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
05:25:01.110 --> 05:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
so to support representative laughlin's
 
05:25:01.120 --> 05:25:02.390 align:start position:0%
so to support representative laughlin's
point

05:25:02.390 --> 05:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
lachman's point i would if we're going
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
to create all the problems that come
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
with slots you should just get slots and
 
05:25:11.430 --> 05:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
get a better deal
 
05:25:14.788 --> 05:25:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh if we wanted um we could then set up
 
05:25:17.670 --> 05:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
a charitable business fee assuming
 
05:25:19.510 --> 05:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
the license was not already being sold
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
to an existing
 
05:25:24.788 --> 05:25:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill allows gambling on slot like
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
slot machine like machines for 18 year
 
05:25:32.470 --> 05:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
olds has been mentioned
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states have a 21 year
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
old restriction on casinos we're going
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
to attract people here
 
05:25:41.430 --> 05:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
i think the 25 betting limit is way too
 
05:25:41.440 --> 05:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
i think the 25 betting limit is way too
high

05:25:43.750 --> 05:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
high
 
05:25:43.760 --> 05:25:45.270 align:start position:0%
high
in

05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
my objections um last time um go ahead
 
05:25:48.718 --> 05:25:50.868 align:start position:0%
my objections um last time um go ahead
and

05:25:50.868 --> 05:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
tell a story about
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
my objection to slot machines in general
 
05:25:56.788 --> 05:25:56.798 align:start position:0%
or slot
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh machines that operate like slot
 
05:25:59.040 --> 05:26:00.788 align:start position:0%
uh machines that operate like slot
machines

05:26:00.788 --> 05:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
machines
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether we want to have
 
05:26:05.110 --> 05:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
historic racing or slots in our town let
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
alone our state i'm going to tell you a
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
story from a constituent
 
05:26:11.350 --> 05:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
who's not still a friend of mine here
 
05:26:13.430 --> 05:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
which i have permission to share
 
05:26:15.670 --> 05:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
his wife's gambling problems destroyed
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
his marriage
 
05:26:18.390 --> 05:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
her habits wiped out most of the
 
05:26:20.390 --> 05:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
couple's savings and he couldn't escape
 
05:26:20.400 --> 05:26:21.510 align:start position:0%
couple's savings and he couldn't escape
it

05:26:21.510 --> 05:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
efforts to divorce were were contested
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
and difficult
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
he moved from massachusetts to lincoln
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
in part to escape that
 
05:26:31.590 --> 05:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
and support his interests his son's
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
interest in aerial ski jumping
 
05:26:36.550 --> 05:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
because he was still married as a
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
strange wife new credit card bills and
 
05:26:41.110 --> 05:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
depths kept coming back to him for a
 
05:26:43.590 --> 05:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
while he was able to get her to quit uh
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
while the divorce
 
05:26:46.708 --> 05:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
process lingered
 
05:26:49.110 --> 05:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
well then encore was going to show up
 
05:26:51.990 --> 05:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
only a few miles from where she lived
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
he knew she she couldn't resist he took
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
the painful step to bring her to grafton
 
05:26:56.080 --> 05:26:57.110 align:start position:0%
the painful step to bring her to grafton
county

05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
county
 
05:26:59.350 --> 05:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
if either historic racing or slots show
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
up here
 
05:27:03.190 --> 05:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
he's moving he's not here anymore
 
05:27:05.190 --> 05:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
he is living next to a hand grenade with
 
05:27:08.230 --> 05:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
a pin removed and his historic racing
 
05:27:10.150 --> 05:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
will provide the jolt to blow up his
 
05:27:11.350 --> 05:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
world again
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
he's asking
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
to preserve the special nature of the
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
granite state is a no slot machine no
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
as as a word of thought and perhaps
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
advice i would like to recommend to the
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors to just try to advance a bill
 
05:27:30.230 --> 05:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
that is slot machines
 
05:27:32.788 --> 05:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
the this effort that we went through two
 
05:27:35.030 --> 05:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
years in a row to use historic horse
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
racing will have this committee and the
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
legislature spinning in a stationary
 
05:27:40.638 --> 05:27:42.070 align:start position:0%
legislature spinning in a stationary
carousel

05:27:42.070 --> 05:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
carousel
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
lots and lots and lots of motion and no
 
05:27:45.600 --> 05:27:46.708 align:start position:0%
lots and lots and lots of motion and no
movement

05:27:46.708 --> 05:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
movement
 
05:27:48.868 --> 05:27:48.878 align:start position:0%
you will also make far better use of the
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
huge intellect in this committee and the
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house and totally get rid
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
of this infuriating semantical argument
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
of whether historic racing machines are
 
05:27:58.400 --> 05:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
of whether historic racing machines are
similar

05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
similar
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
in terms of this backdoor effort to
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
introduce casinos into the state due to
 
05:28:07.350 --> 05:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
its legalization of a technology long
 
05:28:09.430 --> 05:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
believed to be dangerous
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh turning our state for
 
05:28:14.548 --> 05:28:14.558 align:start position:0%
as a welcome with a welcome mat for
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
under 21 year old gamblers
 
05:28:19.350 --> 05:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly poor economics for the state
 
05:28:22.150 --> 05:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
and the charity for historic race device
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
of this type
 
05:28:25.910 --> 05:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
for gross unfairness to pre-selecting
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
who can and
 
05:28:29.430 --> 05:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
cannot get these systems
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the lack of say by local communities
 
05:28:32.160 --> 05:28:32.948 align:start position:0%
and the lack of say by local communities
i

05:28:32.948 --> 05:28:32.958 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:28:34.948 --> 05:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
i don't support this bill in this
 
05:28:36.390 --> 05:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
current structure
 
05:28:38.548 --> 05:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
i strongly urge a body to continue to
 
05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
strengthen our charitable gaming

thank you mr chairman and members of the

committee my name is patrick neely i'm
 
05:29:47.590 --> 05:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
from exacta systems it's good to be
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee again
 
05:29:52.548 --> 05:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
just briefly xacta systems we are the
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
the leading technology and systems
 
05:29:57.670 --> 05:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
provider in the historic horse racing
 
05:29:57.680 --> 05:29:59.270 align:start position:0%
provider in the historic horse racing
space

05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
space
 
05:30:01.350 --> 05:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
we're currently in several jurisdictions
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
including kentucky
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh wyoming and virginia
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
so a lot has been said about historic
 
05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
horse racing obviously a lot has been
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
said uh as i've testified in front of
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
your committee on numerous occasions
 
05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
before so i'll just briefly go through a
 
05:30:17.430 --> 05:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
description of historic horse racing and
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
then we'd be happy
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions um
 
05:30:23.590 --> 05:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
there are two main elements of historic
 
05:30:25.030 --> 05:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
horse racing and the bill sponsor
 
05:30:27.030 --> 05:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative abrami did a good job of
 
05:30:28.708 --> 05:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
going through those the the first is
 
05:30:31.590 --> 05:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
that it is a paramutual wager
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
so a pair mutual wager means that all of
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
the participants are betting against
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
each other
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
you're not betting against the house and
 
05:30:41.670 --> 05:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is a key distinction again
 
05:30:43.750 --> 05:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
as the discussion goes between is this a
 
05:30:45.510 --> 05:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
slot machine is it not a slot machine it
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
is most definitely not a slot machine
 
05:30:49.590 --> 05:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the key distinctions
 
05:30:51.430 --> 05:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
a paramutual wager means that you are
 
05:30:53.270 --> 05:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
wagering against all of your fellow
 
05:30:53.280 --> 05:30:54.390 align:start position:0%
wagering against all of your fellow
players

05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
players
 
05:30:55.910 --> 05:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
when you're betting at a slot machine
 
05:30:57.670 --> 05:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
you are betting against the house
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the way a paramutual wager works is
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
the operator takes a commission on each
 
05:31:01.920 --> 05:31:03.190 align:start position:0%
the operator takes a commission on each
wager

05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
wager
 
05:31:05.030 --> 05:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money is placed into a
 
05:31:07.350 --> 05:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
paramutual pool and is redistributed to
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
winning handicappers
 
05:31:11.030 --> 05:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
this is exactly like live and
 
05:31:13.350 --> 05:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
simulcasting works which is currently
 
05:31:17.030 --> 05:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:18.548 --> 05:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
the second part of
 
05:31:20.230 --> 05:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
paramutual wagering on historic horse
 
05:31:22.390 --> 05:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
racing is that it is a bet on a horse
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
race so again just like a live and a
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
simulcast bet which is currently legal
 
05:31:29.190 --> 05:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
you are betting on the outcome of a
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
horse race so a random number generator
 
05:31:36.070 --> 05:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
determines the outcome of a slot machine
 
05:31:36.080 --> 05:31:37.190 align:start position:0%
determines the outcome of a slot machine
wager

05:31:37.190 --> 05:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
wager
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
this wager is determined by the outcome
 
05:31:41.510 --> 05:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
of horse races so
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
if you are a good handicapper
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
you have a better chance of winning your
 
05:31:48.628 --> 05:31:48.638 align:start position:0%
wager just like a live or a simulcast
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
bet if you went to a racetrack or an otb
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
facility and we're betting on a horse
 
05:31:55.430 --> 05:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
race you have the ability to determine
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether your wager is a winning wager or
 
05:31:59.430 --> 05:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
not based on the skill of your
 
05:31:59.440 --> 05:32:01.430 align:start position:0%
not based on the skill of your
handicapping

05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
handicapping
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
so those are the two
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
primary um
 
05:32:05.280 --> 05:32:06.708 align:start position:0%
primary um
distinguishing

05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
distinguishing
 
05:32:06.718 --> 05:32:08.230 align:start position:0%
distinguishing
factors

05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
factors
 
05:32:10.390 --> 05:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
for historic horse racing it is a pair
 
05:32:12.070 --> 05:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
mutual bet on the outcome of a horse
 
05:32:12.080 --> 05:32:12.948 align:start position:0%
mutual bet on the outcome of a horse
race

05:32:12.948 --> 05:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
race
 
05:32:15.830 --> 05:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it is very much like what is
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
currently legal in the state of new
 
05:32:18.868 --> 05:32:18.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire paramutual wagers on the
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
outcome of horse races
 
05:32:21.200 --> 05:32:21.910 align:start position:0%
outcome of horse races
so

05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
obviously a lot ahead of discussion has
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
already taken place on is this a slot
 
05:32:28.390 --> 05:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
machine is it not a slot machine again
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
those two key distinctions that i talked
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
about will tell you that it is not a
 
05:32:34.708 --> 05:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
slot machine but another thing can tell
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
you that it is not a slot machine
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:32:41.670 --> 05:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds if not thousands of tribal and
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
commercial casinos represented
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
in throughout the country and actually
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the world
 
05:32:51.910 --> 05:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
and at not one single uh one of those
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
casinos either tribal or commercial will
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
you find a historic horse racing
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
terminal not not one there is not one
 
05:33:02.628 --> 05:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
hhr terminal on the floor of any casino
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the united states or the
 
05:33:04.798 --> 05:33:06.708 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the united states or the
world

05:33:06.708 --> 05:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
world
 
05:33:09.350 --> 05:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
so the question is why not if if these
 
05:33:10.868 --> 05:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
were slot machines i think you would
 
05:33:13.270 --> 05:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
expect to find them right next to their
 
05:33:15.270 --> 05:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
slot machine brethren on the floor of a
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
casino and
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
i think there are a lot of reasons why
 
05:33:21.510 --> 05:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
you will not find them there
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
obviously because they're not slot
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
machines a lot of key distinctions
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
number one they're slower um a lot of
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
people have already talked about that
 
05:33:31.030 --> 05:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
today but they go
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
they go slower than slot machines first
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
of all you have the horse races that
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're betting on
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh you have handicapping information
 
05:33:39.510 --> 05:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
that you can look at
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
you can look at past races uh you can
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
order the four order your projected
 
05:33:46.310 --> 05:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
order of finish
 
05:33:48.788 --> 05:33:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh once the races go off you actually
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
look at the uh
 
05:33:52.868 --> 05:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
a replay of the finish of the race and
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
then after that
 
05:33:57.350 --> 05:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
you can look at that past performances
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the horses the official order of
 
05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
finish of the of the particular races so
 
05:34:02.708 --> 05:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:34:07.510 --> 05:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:10.470 --> 05:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
second i would argue that hhr terminals
 
05:34:12.628 --> 05:34:12.638 align:start position:0%
are probably much fairer to the player
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
than our slot machines when you're
 
05:34:15.750 --> 05:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
playing a slot machine
 
05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
you are playing a device that the casino
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
owns and frankly they hope that you lose
 
05:34:22.390 --> 05:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
because you're playing against them if
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
you lose the casino wins and vice versa
 
05:34:28.470 --> 05:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
when you sit down to play an hhr machine
 
05:34:30.230 --> 05:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
you are not playing against the operator
 
05:34:31.590 --> 05:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're not playing against the house
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
you're playing against your fellow
 
05:34:32.878 --> 05:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
you're playing against your fellow
patrons

05:34:34.070 --> 05:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
patrons
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
the operator takes their commission and
 
05:34:37.990 --> 05:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have an incentive for you to
 
05:34:39.510 --> 05:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
lose in fact they don't really care
 
05:34:41.110 --> 05:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
whether you win or lose because they've
 
05:34:42.628 --> 05:34:42.638 align:start position:0%
taken their commission
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
to put forth a pair mutual pool
 
05:34:47.750 --> 05:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and from there it's based on your skill
 
05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
as a handicapper
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
whether you're going to win or whether
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
you're gonna lose your wager
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
and and and that last part i think is a
 
05:34:57.990 --> 05:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
is a is a key distinction
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
the outcome of your bet is up to you um
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
you can be a good historic horse racing
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
player you can be a good handicapper
 
05:35:08.310 --> 05:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
it is impossible to be a good slot
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
machine player slot machines are
 
05:35:11.910 --> 05:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
determined at random your bet is
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
determined at random
 
05:35:16.390 --> 05:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
but as a handicapper just like in live
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
or simulcast racing you can be a good
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
handicapper you can take the time to
 
05:35:21.830 --> 05:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
look at the statistics order your
 
05:35:23.350 --> 05:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
projected order of finish and if you're
 
05:35:25.110 --> 05:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
right if you're good
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
you can be a better player than the
 
05:35:28.230 --> 05:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
person sitting next to you and in fact
 
05:35:29.350 --> 05:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to win more of the
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
paramutual pool than the players sitting
 
05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
next to you because you're a better
 
05:35:33.830 --> 05:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
player so
 
05:35:35.910 --> 05:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
it's this fairness it's this ability to
 
05:35:35.920 --> 05:35:36.868 align:start position:0%
it's this fairness it's this ability to
control

05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
control
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
what you're wagering on and the outcome
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
that is a key distinction
 
05:35:43.590 --> 05:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
so yes the the terminals the way that
 
05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
they're housed those that does resemble
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
a slot machine but what is inside the
 
05:35:51.590 --> 05:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
way the bets work the way that the bets
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
function the pair mutual nature those
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
are all radically different from slot
 
05:35:55.920 --> 05:35:57.510 align:start position:0%
are all radically different from slot
machines

05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
machines
 
05:35:57.520 --> 05:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
machines
and

05:35:59.030 --> 05:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:36:01.030 --> 05:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
earlier raised the issue that well hhr
 
05:36:05.110 --> 05:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
machines are where slot machines can't
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
be um and i i want to i want to clarify
 
05:36:07.600 --> 05:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
be um and i i want to i want to clarify
that

05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:08.480 --> 05:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
every jurisdiction that historic horse
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
racing is legal
 
05:36:16.150 --> 05:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
except for kentucky slot machines are
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
also legal so
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
in oregon there are i believe 14 tribal
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
casinos where slot machines are legal
 
05:36:25.830 --> 05:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing is also legal in
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the state of oregon you will not find a
 
05:36:29.750 --> 05:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
single hhr machine in any of those
 
05:36:31.910 --> 05:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
tribal facilities in oregon
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
the same is in wyoming
 
05:36:36.548 --> 05:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
hhr is legal in the state of wyoming
 
05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
there are tribal facilities in the state
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
of wyoming you will not find a single
 
05:36:42.628 --> 05:36:42.638 align:start position:0%
hhr machine on those tribal in those
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
tribal casinos the same in arkansas
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
casino gaming is legal in arkansas hhr
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
is legal in arkansas
 
05:36:51.030 --> 05:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
you won't find an hhr machine in a
 
05:36:53.910 --> 05:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
casino there same as in virginia casino
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
gaming was just passed in virginia you
 
05:36:57.910 --> 05:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
will not find an hhr machine in any of
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
the new
 
05:37:00.868 --> 05:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
casinos in virginia and again the
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
question is why not and and we've just
 
05:37:05.110 --> 05:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
explained because they're really not
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
competitive they're not the same product
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
and frankly they're not a competitive
 
05:37:10.310 --> 05:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
product with slot machines they're
 
05:37:10.320 --> 05:37:11.670 align:start position:0%
product with slot machines they're
slower

05:37:11.670 --> 05:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
slower
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
they're fairer
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
and they're paramutual in nature
 
05:37:18.390 --> 05:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh finally i'd just like to talk about
 
05:37:20.948 --> 05:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
kentucky uh mr mcintyre briefly talked
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
about that uh kentucky is my home state
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm very familiar with this litigation
 
05:37:28.948 --> 05:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
as mr mcintyre said it was based on the
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
statutory interpretation of prayer
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
mutual under kentucky law i'd like to
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
clarify for the members of the committee
 
05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
the kentucky legislature did not
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
authorize historic horse racing via
 
05:37:42.310 --> 05:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
statute it was originally authorized via
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
regulation by the kentucky horse racing
 
05:37:44.080 --> 05:37:45.110 align:start position:0%
regulation by the kentucky horse racing
commission

05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
so in essence what the kentucky supreme
 
05:37:48.628 --> 05:37:48.638 align:start position:0%
court said is
 
05:37:52.548 --> 05:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
if uh you're we are going to shoehorn
 
05:37:54.070 --> 05:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing under the
 
05:37:56.230 --> 05:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
definition of peer mutual
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
under kentucky statute then the
 
05:38:01.110 --> 05:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to redefine paramutual
 
05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
to include historic horse racing so
 
05:38:04.708 --> 05:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
that's the key distinction obviously
 
05:38:06.510 --> 05:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's a moot point as you are considering
 
05:38:09.270 --> 05:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh to include historic horse
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
racing under peer mutual so uh
 
05:38:15.830 --> 05:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
what was at issue in the kentucky case
 
05:38:17.750 --> 05:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh is moot as it relates to your
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
consideration here today
 
05:38:22.708 --> 05:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
uh with that mr chairman i'll wrap it up
 
05:38:24.070 --> 05:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
and again we'll be happy to answer any
 
05:38:25.910 --> 05:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions on how the system and machines
 
05:38:28.070 --> 05:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
work or anything else as it pertains to
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing
 
05:38:33.350 --> 05:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr neely on your testimony
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
and when um this uh horse racing comes
 
05:38:44.390 --> 05:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
up do you know the names of the horses
 
05:38:46.708 --> 05:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
that are there so they can always bet on
 
05:38:46.718 --> 05:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
that are there so they can always bet on
seabiscuit

05:38:47.830 --> 05:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
seabiscuit
 
05:38:47.840 --> 05:38:49.030 align:start position:0%
seabiscuit
yeah

05:38:49.030 --> 05:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:38:52.708 --> 05:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
no no so we we redact any identifying
 
05:38:54.150 --> 05:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
information when we give you
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
handicapping statistics we remove the
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
names of the horses the names of the
 
05:38:59.750 --> 05:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
jockey the name of the racetrack where
 
05:39:01.910 --> 05:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
the race took place uh the date that
 
05:39:03.270 --> 05:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
that it took place
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh so that you obviously can't get on
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
your phone and look up well what race
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
this was and who won it um so those
 
05:39:12.470 --> 05:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
identifying factors are removed uh but
 
05:39:14.230 --> 05:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
again we give you statistics
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
handicapping statistics
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh that allows you to make uh exercise
 
05:39:21.030 --> 05:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
your skill and judgment and make your
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
handicapping decision uh as you order
 
05:39:25.030 --> 05:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
your projected order of finish but
 
05:39:25.990 --> 05:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:39:28.150 --> 05:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
instead of seabiscuit it's horse number
 
05:39:28.160 --> 05:39:29.590 align:start position:0%
instead of seabiscuit it's horse number
one

05:39:29.590 --> 05:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair paul
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
but the statistics on the uh horse are
 
05:39:38.230 --> 05:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
provided that is whether it's a mutter
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a dry track or a turf
 
05:39:41.840 --> 05:39:43.670 align:start position:0%
whether it's a a dry track or a turf
horse

05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
horse
 
05:39:46.548 --> 05:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
gender it's a record
 
05:39:48.390 --> 05:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that that that is correct that is
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
correct so you can't identify the horse
 
05:39:51.910 --> 05:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
but we we provide you with handicapping
 
05:39:53.430 --> 05:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
statistics like
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
jockey rating at the at the current
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
distance and on the track surface uh
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
or post position wind percentage at this
 
05:40:04.470 --> 05:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
particular track and distance and
 
05:40:06.868 --> 05:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
surface uh things of that nature
 
05:40:09.430 --> 05:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh so that you can make an educated
 
05:40:09.440 --> 05:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
uh so that you can make an educated
decision

05:40:10.390 --> 05:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh when you make your handicapping
 
05:40:12.480 --> 05:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
uh when you make your handicapping
selections

05:40:13.670 --> 05:40:13.680 align:start position:0%

05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh yes

05:40:23.430 --> 05:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:40:27.590 --> 05:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
so mr neely
 
05:40:27.600 --> 05:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
so mr neely
uh

05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
are you able to
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
tell me what percent of the dollar value
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
of bets placed on historic racing
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
machines whether
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
by statewide or
 
05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the country however you want to
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
answer this
 
05:40:45.030 --> 05:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
are placed by
 
05:40:49.510 --> 05:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:51.670 --> 05:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
we we don't have those numbers i don't
 
05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
have those percentages um so let me talk
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the auto play feature
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
in our system it's called auto cap that
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
means that's short for auto handicapping
 
05:41:02.240 --> 05:41:02.948 align:start position:0%
means that's short for auto handicapping
so

05:41:02.948 --> 05:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:06.150 --> 05:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
what this allows the handicapper to do
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
is accept the off odds of the horse race
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
when the horse race went off when it was
 
05:41:15.430 --> 05:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
originally run say 15 years ago
 
05:41:18.230 --> 05:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
so this allows handicappers to employ a
 
05:41:20.470 --> 05:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
relatively common betting strategy which
 
05:41:22.470 --> 05:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
is what we call in the racing business
 
05:41:23.990 --> 05:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
betting the tote board so you're betting
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
the favorite to win
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
you bet the favorite to win and you bet
 
05:41:29.350 --> 05:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
the second choice of the betting public
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
to run second and you bet the third
 
05:41:33.190 --> 05:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
choice of the betting public to run
 
05:41:33.200 --> 05:41:34.470 align:start position:0%
choice of the betting public to run
third

05:41:34.470 --> 05:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
third
 
05:41:37.030 --> 05:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
so if you go to a racetrack or an otb
 
05:41:39.430 --> 05:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
facility today you will see
 
05:41:41.430 --> 05:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of people employing that
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
handicapping strategy um you bet the
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
favorite you bet the favorite to win so
 
05:41:47.510 --> 05:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's what autocap allows the
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
handicapper to do is basically bet the
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
tote board now if the player doesn't
 
05:41:53.190 --> 05:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
want to bet the tote board and wants to
 
05:41:54.548 --> 05:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
make their own decisions that they think
 
05:41:56.310 --> 05:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
that the betting favorite is
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh a false favorite shouldn't be the
 
05:42:00.070 --> 05:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
favorite then they get the ability to
 
05:42:02.470 --> 05:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
reorder their projected order of finish
 
05:42:05.270 --> 05:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
so again just like a live or simulcast
 
05:42:07.750 --> 05:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
race um but that that is what the auto
 
05:42:10.868 --> 05:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
cap feature does and uh that's how
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's how it functions but
 
05:42:16.150 --> 05:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't have the percentage of uh of
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
how many people use auto cap and how
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
many people don't
 
05:42:21.200 --> 05:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
many people don't
oh

05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:24.000 --> 05:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:42:24.240 --> 05:42:24.250 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:42:24.250 --> 05:42:25.590 align:start position:0%
yeah
[Music]

05:42:25.590 --> 05:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's surprising to me that you
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that data like that
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
is that because it's
 
05:42:33.350 --> 05:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
technically difficult to obtain or you
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
just don't collect that data
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we we do not track it uh that's
 
05:42:40.310 --> 05:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
just not something that is reported in
 
05:42:42.390 --> 05:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
our system um
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
what is reported in our system and kind
 
05:42:47.190 --> 05:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
of following up on an oversight question
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
that was raised before
 
05:42:52.628 --> 05:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh every wager that is placed is tracked
 
05:42:55.670 --> 05:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
in real time um and is auditable and is
 
05:42:59.350 --> 05:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
reported uh at the end of every day to
 
05:43:02.390 --> 05:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the regulators as i said we're
 
05:43:04.470 --> 05:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
we are operational in virginia kentucky
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
and wyoming currently so at the end of
 
05:43:09.030 --> 05:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
every day our system generates
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
a voluminous report that goes to the
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
various regulators
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh that actually can go down to a bet by
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
bet uh examination of what took place
 
05:43:21.590 --> 05:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
during that day so the regulators are
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
able every morning to look exactly how
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
much money was wagered into a pure
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
mutual pool how much money was won out
 
05:43:29.670 --> 05:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
of a pair mutual pool
 
05:43:31.350 --> 05:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
right down to the machine level how much
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
money was wagered on a specific hhr
 
05:43:33.600 --> 05:43:34.868 align:start position:0%
money was wagered on a specific hhr
terminal

05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
terminal
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
so again all of that is produced on a
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
and is easily
 
05:43:42.628 --> 05:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
easily formatted so that the regulators
 
05:43:44.948 --> 05:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
can see exactly what's taking place
 
05:43:44.958 --> 05:43:45.750 align:start position:0%
can see exactly what's taking place
uh

05:43:45.750 --> 05:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
every day on the hhr floors
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
we should have one more follow up follow
 
05:43:50.638 --> 05:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
we should have one more follow up follow
up

05:43:53.670 --> 05:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:53.680 --> 05:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
many

05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
many
 
05:43:58.070 --> 05:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
who have commented on historic racing
 
05:44:00.070 --> 05:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
during the time that i've been
 
05:44:03.190 --> 05:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
following this debate um
 
05:44:03.200 --> 05:44:04.070 align:start position:0%
following this debate um
say

05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
that uh and maybe they're uninformed to
 
05:44:08.310 --> 05:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
say that uh
 
05:44:09.830 --> 05:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
that most
 
05:44:12.788 --> 05:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
players something like that most players
 
05:44:15.190 --> 05:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
use the autoplay feature
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
um is that wrong
 
05:44:20.628 --> 05:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh no i don't believe so i would say
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
that a majority of people use autocap
 
05:44:27.430 --> 05:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
but i will tell you that a significant
 
05:44:28.708 --> 05:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh enjoy the handicapping features and
 
05:44:32.310 --> 05:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
definitely take advantage of that as
 
05:44:32.320 --> 05:44:33.590 align:start position:0%
definitely take advantage of that as
well

05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.638 --> 05:44:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:44:38.830 --> 05:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:44:41.190 --> 05:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
dussette thank you mr chairman and thank
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
you mr nealy for taking my question and
 
05:44:46.390 --> 05:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
it's good to hear you again sir uh
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
in in brief uh there was an assertion
 
05:44:52.150 --> 05:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
made that there's some sort of uh random
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
number generating component of uh
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
with hhr machines maybe you can explain
 
05:44:59.910 --> 05:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
a little better how the next race is
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
generated in in that
 
05:45:05.350 --> 05:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
is it is it comparable
 
05:45:07.750 --> 05:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the way a slot machine operates or is
 
05:45:07.760 --> 05:45:08.548 align:start position:0%
to the way a slot machine operates or is
it

05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:45:10.390 --> 05:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
in fact uh
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you can describe it better if you
 
05:45:14.230 --> 05:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
know what i'm getting at is is there a
 
05:45:16.628 --> 05:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
component of random generation of any
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
sort of uh sure end of this thank you
 
05:45:24.150 --> 05:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so let me clarify that so
 
05:45:25.990 --> 05:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
random number generator is kind of a
 
05:45:28.628 --> 05:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
buzzword in the the slot machine world
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
because that that is how an at the
 
05:45:32.310 --> 05:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
outcome of a wager is determined right
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's determined at random so an rng is
 
05:45:37.350 --> 05:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the device and it determines whether
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
this player is going to win this
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
particular spin historic horse racing
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
terminals do not have that
 
05:45:46.788 --> 05:45:46.798 align:start position:0%
the outcome is not determined at random
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
your wager is won or lost based on the
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
results of the horse race and your
 
05:45:52.788 --> 05:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
handicapping ability whether you got it
 
05:45:54.548 --> 05:45:54.558 align:start position:0%
right or got it wrong
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
so we do have a library of roughly 100
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
000 historic horse races and so when a
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
player wants to bet on a historic horse
 
05:46:02.718 --> 05:46:03.670 align:start position:0%
player wants to bet on a historic horse
race

05:46:03.670 --> 05:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
race
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
three in our system three races are
 
05:46:08.470 --> 05:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
pulled from that from that database and
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
presented to the player
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
so that that's how the system works we
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
also have an alternative where uh
 
05:46:16.150 --> 05:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:46:17.910 --> 05:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
historic horse races are actually
 
05:46:20.310 --> 05:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
scheduled at the beginning of the day
 
05:46:23.110 --> 05:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
um and they run through uh until
 
05:46:26.390 --> 05:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
wagering closes for that day um
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
so again there are there are two ways to
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
base quote unquote schedule what races
 
05:46:33.830 --> 05:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be wagered on uh by
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing handicappers
 
05:46:39.590 --> 05:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully representative do set that
 
05:46:41.830 --> 05:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
clears it up a little bit thank you yes
 
05:46:43.110 --> 05:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
it did thank you
 
05:46:44.830 --> 05:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you miss
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
oh thank you mr chair
 
05:46:52.470 --> 05:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
you you're talking about auto cap i
 
05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
assume you're talking about automatic
 
05:46:54.400 --> 05:46:55.750 align:start position:0%
assume you're talking about automatic
handicapping

05:46:55.750 --> 05:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
handicapping
 
05:46:57.750 --> 05:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding that this
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
particular feature applies to a large
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
number of sports besides horse racing i
 
05:47:06.070 --> 05:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
think that applies to golf football
 
05:47:06.080 --> 05:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
think that applies to golf football
basketball

05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
basketball
 
05:47:07.440 --> 05:47:08.708 align:start position:0%
basketball
baseball

05:47:08.708 --> 05:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
baseball
 
05:47:10.868 --> 05:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
and golfing
 
05:47:12.150 --> 05:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
where you can
 
05:47:15.270 --> 05:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
determine uh either your handicap for
 
05:47:17.270 --> 05:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
your scoring purposes
 
05:47:19.910 --> 05:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
or your the handicap
 
05:47:19.920 --> 05:47:20.788 align:start position:0%
or your the handicap
for

05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:47:20.798 --> 05:47:21.830 align:start position:0%
for
uh

05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
betting purposes uh on these various
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:31.830 --> 05:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
could you describe what automatic
 
05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
handicapping is
 
05:47:37.190 --> 05:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
or give us a link as to some place to
 
05:47:39.030 --> 05:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
describe it or find it
 
05:47:42.070 --> 05:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
to to better understand it because store
 
05:47:44.310 --> 05:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
i hear one person saying that it's a
 
05:47:47.270 --> 05:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
skill activity yourself i hear another
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
person saying that it's a random
 
05:47:51.990 --> 05:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
generation of facts and figures
 
05:47:55.830 --> 05:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
sure so uh handicapping is uh i think
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
the generally accepted nomenclature of
 
05:48:00.788 --> 05:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh people who are trying to predict the
 
05:48:03.910 --> 05:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
outcome of a particular race now
 
05:48:06.390 --> 05:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
golf and other sports uh
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
not related to us we we don't we don't
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
do any of that um
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
so handicapping is the art of trying to
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
accurately select the outcome of a horse
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
race so you're if if i'm when i go to
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
the track and i'm placing my bets i'm
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a handicapper and i'm handicapping
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
the race i'm trying to determine who's
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to win who's going to run second
 
05:48:29.830 --> 05:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
who's going to run third
 
05:48:31.750 --> 05:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
so there are lots of handicapping
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
strategies that people employ
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier one of the most
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
popular ones is betting on the favorite
 
05:48:40.230 --> 05:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
so some people will not look at the
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
racing form
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh their handicapping strategy is to bet
 
05:48:45.990 --> 05:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
on whoever the favorite is in the race
 
05:48:48.310 --> 05:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
that's their handicapping strategy
 
05:48:49.830 --> 05:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
some people's handicapping strategy is
 
05:48:52.150 --> 05:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
to bet on their lucky number or the
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
favorite color of their jockey silks
 
05:48:56.150 --> 05:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's how they handicap the race
 
05:48:58.548 --> 05:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
so when i talk about auto handicapping
 
05:49:00.708 --> 05:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
in our system i'm talking about the
 
05:49:02.390 --> 05:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
first handicapping strategy that i
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
discussed which is betting the favorites
 
05:49:07.350 --> 05:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
so it automatically orders the horses
 
05:49:09.990 --> 05:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
from favorite to long shot and you're
 
05:49:12.470 --> 05:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
betting on the tote board so
 
05:49:14.310 --> 05:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh that that is what that is what we're
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
talking about when we're talking about
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
auto handicapping you are making the
 
05:49:20.070 --> 05:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
decision as a handicapper
 
05:49:22.310 --> 05:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
to bet the favorite to win to bet the
 
05:49:25.030 --> 05:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
second place horse to run second all the
 
05:49:26.310 --> 05:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
way down to the longest shot on the
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
board to run last
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
so that that
 
05:49:31.510 --> 05:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
that that's that is what handicapping
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
means in the horse racing world and that
 
05:49:35.190 --> 05:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
is what auto handicapping means in our
 
05:49:35.200 --> 05:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
is what auto handicapping means in our
system

05:49:42.150 --> 05:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:42.160 --> 05:49:44.708 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:49:44.708 --> 05:49:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:44.718 --> 05:49:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
representing

05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you just one last question on
 
05:49:52.070 --> 05:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
this autoplay
 
05:49:56.070 --> 05:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
matter um can you tell me how uh
 
05:49:58.310 --> 05:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
how much time lapses
 
05:49:58.320 --> 05:49:59.110 align:start position:0%
how much time lapses
uh

05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:00.788 --> 05:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
has to lapse
 
05:50:00.798 --> 05:50:02.708 align:start position:0%
has to lapse
between

05:50:02.708 --> 05:50:02.718 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:50:05.910 --> 05:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh plays bets if when using the auto
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
play feature how how frequently
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
within a minute or uh
 
05:50:13.510 --> 05:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
how many seconds does it take to go from
 
05:50:15.590 --> 05:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
one bit to the next when you're
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
determined to just hit that button
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it is so again it depends on the
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
player um so if you're trying to
 
05:50:27.270 --> 05:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
not look at any uh any other information
 
05:50:29.190 --> 05:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
if you want to ignore
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh your
 
05:50:31.990 --> 05:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
the past performance chart if you want
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
to ignore the official results of the
 
05:50:34.788 --> 05:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
race if you don't want to look at the
 
05:50:37.030 --> 05:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
replay if your goal is to do it as fast
 
05:50:38.548 --> 05:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
as you can is that that's what you're
 
05:50:38.558 --> 05:50:39.430 align:start position:0%
as you can is that that's what you're
asking

05:50:39.430 --> 05:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
asking
 
05:50:42.788 --> 05:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's pr it's probably four to
 
05:50:45.830 --> 05:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
five seconds depending um again
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh unlike a slot machine which can give
 
05:50:50.230 --> 05:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
you a result in about a quarter or a
 
05:50:52.470 --> 05:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
half of a second this is a pair mutual
 
05:50:54.470 --> 05:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
bet on a horse race so when you place
 
05:50:57.030 --> 05:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
the bet the tote system has to evaluate
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
your wager it has to evaluate uh the
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
finishing order of the race it has to
 
05:51:04.470 --> 05:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether your
 
05:51:05.990 --> 05:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
wager is a winning one and then it has
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
to evaluate what percentage of the
 
05:51:09.350 --> 05:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
paramutual pool you're going to receive
 
05:51:09.360 --> 05:51:10.230 align:start position:0%
paramutual pool you're going to receive
so

05:51:10.230 --> 05:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:51:11.910 --> 05:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
all of that is taking place behind the
 
05:51:11.920 --> 05:51:12.708 align:start position:0%
all of that is taking place behind the
scene

05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
scene
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh in the tote and so that is why hhr is
 
05:51:20.470 --> 05:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
significantly slower than um than a
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
traditional slot machine so i i would
 
05:51:25.830 --> 05:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
say probably five seconds maybe six um
 
05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
if you really wanted to go as quickly as
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
you could
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
okay that's helpful four to six seconds
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
is my take away
 
05:51:32.638 --> 05:51:38.830 align:start position:0%
is my take away
thank

05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you mr chairman um kind of
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
following up on the timing issue there
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you decide to manually handicap um
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
each race
 
05:51:51.430 --> 05:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
is there does the machine
 
05:51:53.430 --> 05:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
cause you to move along quickly or does
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
it give you as much time as you need or
 
05:51:57.430 --> 05:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
how does that work yeah so it depends on
 
05:51:59.110 --> 05:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
the setting it's configurable and it
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
depends on the jurisdiction if there are
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
any jurisdictional requirements um
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
in most jurisdictions where we're
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
operating we give people between 30
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
seconds and a minute per race um to make
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
their handicapping decision and and
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
again we have three races that you're
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
wagering on at a time so
 
05:52:18.868 --> 05:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere from a minute and a half to
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
three minutes um again that can be
 
05:52:23.590 --> 05:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
configurable um
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
what we you know don't want to do is
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
give a player so much time uh again that
 
05:52:30.230 --> 05:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
this is an event that took place uh
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
already so the you know the answer is
 
05:52:34.548 --> 05:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
out there um
 
05:52:34.558 --> 05:52:35.270 align:start position:0%
out there um
so

05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:52:36.788 --> 05:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
what we we don't want to do is give a
 
05:52:39.030 --> 05:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
player two hours to try to figure out
 
05:52:40.788 --> 05:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know what what particular race this
 
05:52:42.868 --> 05:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
was um so we we feel like there needs to
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
be some reasonable time limitation
 
05:52:47.430 --> 05:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh in order to give people enough time
 
05:52:49.830 --> 05:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
to handicap look at the statistics uh
 
05:52:51.590 --> 05:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
but not so much time that they could
 
05:52:55.670 --> 05:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
attempt to uh game the system
 
05:52:58.470 --> 05:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman oh
 
05:53:00.868 --> 05:53:00.878 align:start position:0%
so you're you're picking three races and
 
05:53:03.350 --> 05:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
how many horses are you handicapping
 
05:53:05.510 --> 05:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
what three three horses in each race
 
05:53:05.520 --> 05:53:07.350 align:start position:0%
what three three horses in each race
yeah

05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:53:08.788 --> 05:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
there are different systems are
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
different in ours most of the wagers
 
05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're gonna win
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
the top two the top three are the top
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
four horses in those races so you're
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
either trying to handy
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
6 12 or 18 finishing positions uh
 
05:53:25.510 --> 05:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
depending on what peer mutual uh pool
 
05:53:28.150 --> 05:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
you are wagering into
 
05:53:32.230 --> 05:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:35.430 --> 05:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:53:38.230 --> 05:53:38.240 align:start position:0%

you very much for entertaining our
testimony

05:54:18.628 --> 05:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:54:22.070 --> 05:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
i wanted to testify in favor of the bill
 
05:54:25.670 --> 05:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
because for a couple of basic reasons
 
05:54:27.990 --> 05:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaining gaming sites are
 
05:54:30.948 --> 05:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
providing very vital
 
05:54:33.590 --> 05:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
support for the non-profits
 
05:54:35.030 --> 05:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
that and i'm sure that you and the
 
05:54:36.310 --> 05:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee are very
 
05:54:37.750 --> 05:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
familiar with the
 
05:54:40.230 --> 05:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
range of needs that the non-profits
 
05:54:44.070 --> 05:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
help to address but homelessness and
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
kids in need the boys and girls club
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh the girls inc
 
05:54:52.548 --> 05:54:52.558 align:start position:0%
shelters for families you know all just
 
05:54:52.558 --> 05:54:54.150 align:start position:0%
shelters for families you know all just
everything

05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
everything
 
05:54:54.160 --> 05:54:55.590 align:start position:0%
everything
and

05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
those non-profits have you know really
 
05:55:00.310 --> 05:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
rely on the support that comes from the
 
05:55:02.548 --> 05:55:02.558 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming sites
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
and now during the pandemic
 
05:55:08.948 --> 05:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
that support is even more important
 
05:55:11.830 --> 05:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
because the traditional
 
05:55:14.708 --> 05:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
fundraising activities which most
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
non-profits engage in
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
have been very you know very curtailed
 
05:55:20.948 --> 05:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
you know there aren't
 
05:55:23.830 --> 05:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
galas or dinners or a lot of fundraising
 
05:55:26.070 --> 05:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
events those can't be held
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
so the non-profits excuse me the
 
05:55:31.030 --> 05:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming sites have become even
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
even more important
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
this will help the charitable gaming
 
05:55:38.310 --> 05:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
sites to
 
05:55:40.948 --> 05:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
realize more revenue for charitable
 
05:55:40.958 --> 05:55:42.150 align:start position:0%
realize more revenue for charitable
gaming

05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
and really will bring more people into
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming sites so that
 
05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
those same people could you know risk
 
05:55:52.310 --> 05:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
money on a
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
or something else that uh is also there
 
05:55:58.948 --> 05:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i and i know many
 
05:56:00.948 --> 05:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
mo you know many charities many
 
05:56:02.548 --> 05:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
non-profits in our
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
region are very much for this
 
05:56:07.190 --> 05:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh secondly some of the money as the
 
05:56:09.270 --> 05:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor testified will also be going
 
05:56:10.628 --> 05:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
into the
 
05:56:14.548 --> 05:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh educational trust fund
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
never enough money is in the educational
 
05:56:20.070 --> 05:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund there's a lot of support that
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
schools need even now during the
 
05:56:24.868 --> 05:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic that's become more acute
 
05:56:28.788 --> 05:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking the committee to
 
05:56:31.350 --> 05:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
act favorably on this bill so that we
 
05:56:31.360 --> 05:56:33.030 align:start position:0%
act favorably on this bill so that we
can

05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
provide even more support during a very
 
05:56:37.830 --> 05:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
critical time and beyond even beyond the
 
05:56:37.840 --> 05:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
critical time and beyond even beyond the
pandemic

05:56:39.030 --> 05:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:56:42.150 --> 05:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
for the good work of the nonprofits that
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
and if you have questions i'd of course
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer them
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
but that concludes my testimony mr chair
 
05:57:00.788 --> 05:57:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
any questions for the mayor
 
05:57:07.190 --> 05:57:07.200 align:start position:0%

the united way of greater nashua and i
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
do come to you today in favor of h.b 626
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
seeking to expand charitable gaming to
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
include historic horse racing
 
05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh as a community organization we don't
 
05:57:54.948 --> 05:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
take this endorsement lightly we are
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about the negative
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
consequences of gaming addiction
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
and the need for mental health supports
 
05:58:01.990 --> 05:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
for those who are affected by this
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
particular disease
 
05:58:06.070 --> 05:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
that said and to set our minds at ease
 
05:58:07.670 --> 05:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've had conversations with local
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
mental health providers including those
 
05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
representing greater nashua mental
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
health and harbor care to to determine
 
05:58:16.230 --> 05:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
if the presence of charitable gaming in
 
05:58:18.470 --> 05:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
our community has contributed in in any
 
05:58:20.628 --> 05:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
significant way to gaming addiction in
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
the community we've been assured that
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
this has not been the case
 
05:58:27.030 --> 05:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
it is our feeling that historic horse
 
05:58:29.110 --> 05:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
racing with its emphasis on wagering
 
05:58:32.788 --> 05:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
bets on actual races already run is not
 
05:58:34.470 --> 05:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
significantly more addictive than other
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
types of gaming including card games
 
05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
and less addictive likely than pure
 
05:58:41.910 --> 05:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
games of chance such as roulette which
 
05:58:43.990 --> 05:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
already exist in our charitable gaming
 
05:58:44.000 --> 05:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
already exist in our charitable gaming
houses

05:58:45.030 --> 05:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
houses
 
05:58:47.430 --> 05:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
therefore we see more potential
 
05:58:49.190 --> 05:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
benefits to allowing the presence of
 
05:58:51.270 --> 05:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
historical or horse racing as it
 
05:58:53.430 --> 05:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
pertains specifically to the non-profit
 
05:58:55.430 --> 05:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
supports in our community
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
over the past few years we've been
 
05:58:56.878 --> 05:58:57.910 align:start position:0%
over the past few years we've been
indirect

05:58:57.910 --> 05:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
indirect
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
we at united way have been the direct
 
05:59:01.430 --> 05:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
recipients of these donations along with
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of other local
 
05:59:03.120 --> 05:59:04.548 align:start position:0%
dozens and dozens of other local
nonprofits

05:59:04.548 --> 05:59:04.558 align:start position:0%
nonprofits
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
by my estimation
 
05:59:08.230 --> 05:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
the largest grant making supporters of
 
05:59:09.990 --> 05:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit work in our community include
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire charitable foundation
 
05:59:14.470 --> 05:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
the city of nashua and united way
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
when each of us makes a grant to a local
 
05:59:18.390 --> 05:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
non-profit we put any number of
 
05:59:20.788 --> 05:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
stipulations on those funds and this is
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
important because it means that those
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
funds are restricted to specific
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
activities and specific outcomes
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
that can also be said for state and
 
05:59:31.590 --> 05:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
federal funding however
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
importantly funds received from
 
05:59:35.110 --> 05:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming are similar to most
 
05:59:36.948 --> 05:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
individual donations and that they are
 
05:59:36.958 --> 05:59:38.310 align:start position:0%
individual donations and that they are
unrestricted

05:59:38.310 --> 05:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
05:59:40.150 --> 05:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
what that means to a non-profit in the
 
05:59:41.910 --> 05:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
is that these funds can be used for any
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
number of types of expenses including
 
05:59:46.310 --> 05:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
utilities payroll paying the rent
 
05:59:48.548 --> 05:59:48.558 align:start position:0%
supporting volunteers etc
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
in our case we've used these
 
05:59:52.628 --> 05:59:52.638 align:start position:0%
unrestricted dollars in many cases to
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
support our covid19 emergency relief
 
05:59:55.280 --> 05:59:56.470 align:start position:0%
support our covid19 emergency relief
efforts

05:59:56.470 --> 05:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
05:59:57.990 --> 05:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
05:59:58.000 --> 06:00:00.230 align:start position:0%
because of the
unrestricted

06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
06:00:01.990 --> 06:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
uses of those funds without the
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility of unrestricted funding
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
exactly like that which comes from
 
06:00:07.910 --> 06:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming those efforts could be
 
06:00:07.920 --> 06:00:09.350 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming those efforts could be
crippled

06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
crippled
 
06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
one aspect of the bill we appreciate is
 
06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
its emphasis on keeping the dollars
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
within the executive council district
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
in other words local dollars stay local
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is a good thing and very much
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
mirrors our emphasis at united way
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
with almost 400 registered non-profits
 
06:00:27.270 --> 06:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
in greater nashua in good standing we
 
06:00:28.788 --> 06:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
feel that the need is very strong in our
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
community because of these points low
 
06:00:32.788 --> 06:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
likely incidents of increased gaming
 
06:00:32.798 --> 06:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
likely incidents of increased gaming
addiction

06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
06:00:36.310 --> 06:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
significant unrestricted dollars
 
06:00:38.548 --> 06:00:38.558 align:start position:0%
emphasis on local community we support
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
and endorse the passage of 626. thank

thank you for testifying i just had a
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
quick question or it's actually kind of
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
a couple questions i'm assuming um do
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
you all already take advantage of the 10
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
yes we have taken advantage of the 10
 
06:01:50.470 --> 06:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
days of charitable gaming that we get
 
06:01:52.868 --> 06:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's 7 days sometimes it's 10
 
06:01:52.878 --> 06:01:54.390 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's 7 days sometimes it's 10
days

06:01:54.390 --> 06:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
days
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
that of course is entirely up to the
 
06:01:56.558 --> 06:01:57.590 align:start position:0%
that of course is entirely up to the
gaming

06:01:57.590 --> 06:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
06:01:57.600 --> 06:01:58.708 align:start position:0%
gaming
um

06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
operator themselves but we certainly do
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
and if i can ask a follow-up i'm curious
 
06:02:08.140 --> 06:02:08.150 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm curious to um
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:09.270 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm curious to um
[Music]

06:02:09.270 --> 06:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i used to run a non-profit and i'm
 
06:02:12.708 --> 06:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
i'm curious to get your feedback your
 
06:02:17.030 --> 06:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the 35 of the two dollars
 
06:02:19.590 --> 06:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
that you would share with the state um
 
06:02:20.708 --> 06:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
would you
 
06:02:22.150 --> 06:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a silly question because of
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
course i'm sure you want more but can
 
06:02:27.510 --> 06:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
you kind of give a um
 
06:02:29.750 --> 06:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
an idea to the committee of you know
 
06:02:32.470 --> 06:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
what do you do with the that 70 cents
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
that you're gonna get and how how do you
 
06:02:37.670 --> 06:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
do you wish you could get more i mean i
 
06:02:37.680 --> 06:02:39.110 align:start position:0%
do you wish you could get more i mean i
i

06:02:39.110 --> 06:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:02:40.708 --> 06:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's a silly question of course but can
 
06:02:42.548 --> 06:02:42.558 align:start position:0%
you share what you do with that 70 cents
 
06:02:44.948 --> 06:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
of those two dollars
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
well um
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
so of course it's not a silly question
 
06:02:49.830 --> 06:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
to say do i wish we got more because of
 
06:02:52.548 --> 06:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
course we wish we got more but um
 
06:02:55.110 --> 06:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
that said we're also uh very grateful
 
06:02:57.510 --> 06:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
for what we do get and i'm sure as a as
 
06:02:59.110 --> 06:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
a prior executive director and a
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
non-profit you would you can appreciate
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
06:03:04.868 --> 06:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
um what we do is so our every of course
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
every nonprofit is different
 
06:03:08.708 --> 06:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
our united way um
 
06:03:11.910 --> 06:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
is as pretty efficient 87 of the money
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
that we raise actually goes toward the
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
work we do in the community and less
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
than two percent of the money we raise
 
06:03:19.910 --> 06:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually exits the community for any
 
06:03:21.990 --> 06:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
reason that those are pretty pretty good
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
numbers so we put it to work doing any
 
06:03:25.350 --> 06:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
number of things
 
06:03:27.750 --> 06:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
typically we use it to make grants to
 
06:03:30.070 --> 06:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
our non-profit partners
 
06:03:33.030 --> 06:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
during our during the covid period we've
 
06:03:36.470 --> 06:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
also made over 50 emergency grants we've
 
06:03:38.470 --> 06:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
purchased and distributed over 400
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
wireless hotspots to local students
 
06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
we've distributed 600 laptops 200 000
 
06:03:47.110 --> 06:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
face masks the list kind of goes on and
 
06:03:50.628 --> 06:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
on the the the thing that i'd like to
 
06:03:52.868 --> 06:03:52.878 align:start position:0%
share with people is that we're able to
 
06:03:55.670 --> 06:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
do that type of work with this kind of
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
funding because the funding is
 
06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
unrestricted meaning it does allow us to
 
06:04:03.510 --> 06:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
be flexible in making a difference in
 
06:04:05.990 --> 06:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
our community in the ways in which our
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
our impact measurements
 
06:04:12.708 --> 06:04:12.718 align:start position:0%
would direct us versus getting a grant
 
06:04:15.190 --> 06:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
from the city or state or
 
06:04:17.270 --> 06:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
federal government that says
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
you need to spend it on this thing and
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
this thing alone
 
06:04:21.750 --> 06:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
so that's how this funding is used
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
differently i hope that answers your
 
06:04:25.750 --> 06:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you any further
 
06:04:25.760 --> 06:04:27.030 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you any further

06:04:48.310 --> 06:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
one how how but i never relied on
 
06:04:49.830 --> 06:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
how does an organization budget
 
06:04:55.910 --> 06:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
for uh the va the very variances from
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
year to year
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
that may accompany that kind of money i
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
understand the unrestricted part of this
 
06:05:04.070 --> 06:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
and that's very valuable i get that
 
06:05:05.830 --> 06:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
but that amount can change from year to
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
year and if you get in line if you're
 
06:05:09.590 --> 06:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
not in line and all that how does that
 
06:05:11.910 --> 06:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
how do you account for those changes
 
06:05:13.830 --> 06:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
from year to year in what you might
 
06:05:16.708 --> 06:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
expect from charitable gaming
 
06:05:18.470 --> 06:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative molloy that is
 
06:05:20.948 --> 06:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
actually an outstanding question we um
 
06:05:23.670 --> 06:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking budget these dollars
 
06:05:26.708 --> 06:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily conservatively
 
06:05:26.718 --> 06:05:27.590 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily conservatively
and

06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:05:30.150 --> 06:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
frankly this year we've been glad of
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
that practice seeing how
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
institutions have been open been closed
 
06:05:39.190 --> 06:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
in restricted capacity etc
 
06:05:41.510 --> 06:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
our budgeting our budgeting
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
is for no more than 50 of what we
 
06:05:45.510 --> 06:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
received in the prior year
 
06:05:47.990 --> 06:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
06:05:50.548 --> 06:05:50.558 align:start position:0%
and if we receive more we're um
 
06:05:52.390 --> 06:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
astonished and grateful
 
06:05:54.390 --> 06:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
but i also recommend to all of our
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
nonprofit partners don't budget high on
 
06:05:59.510 --> 06:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
these dollars because you know what
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why they call it
 
06:06:03.670 --> 06:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
gambling it's gambling and
 
06:06:05.750 --> 06:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of there are a lot of
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
um reasons why those dollars can change
 
06:06:10.948 --> 06:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
covet is the frankly the last of them
 
06:06:13.030 --> 06:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we ever thought about the first of
 
06:06:15.510 --> 06:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
them is you're at the
 
06:06:17.670 --> 06:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
you're really um at the mercy of the
 
06:06:20.230 --> 06:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
gaming operator to decide whether you
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
are going to be recipient at all
 
06:06:24.230 --> 06:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
and to what extent you're going to
 
06:06:26.788 --> 06:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
receive days and then of course you have
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
what those days are
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
so we try to be conservative with that
 
06:06:31.990 --> 06:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
and i recommend to everybody to be
 
06:06:34.390 --> 06:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
conservative with that
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
saying none that i'm going to ask for
 
06:06:41.430 --> 06:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
the next next person to testify is a
 
06:06:41.440 --> 06:06:42.548 align:start position:0%

from the from the lens of a non-profit
 
06:07:30.310 --> 06:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
board member um i'll reiterate what
 
06:07:33.030 --> 06:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
mayor jim doncha said we live and die
 
06:07:34.470 --> 06:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
off of the money that we get through
 
06:07:34.480 --> 06:07:35.670 align:start position:0%
off of the money that we get through
fundraising

06:07:35.670 --> 06:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
fundraising
 
06:07:37.590 --> 06:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
we have to struggle to have different
 
06:07:37.600 --> 06:07:38.628 align:start position:0%
we have to struggle to have different
events

06:07:38.628 --> 06:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
events
 
06:07:41.670 --> 06:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
we compete with over 250 non-profits in
 
06:07:43.030 --> 06:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
nashville we're all competing for the
 
06:07:44.708 --> 06:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
same dollars for those of you who've
 
06:07:46.310 --> 06:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
testified who've run boards or been on
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
boards you understand the difficulty of
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
that and trying to all get along trying
 
06:07:51.990 --> 06:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
to solicit people for the same funds
 
06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
that can be very challenging
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming aspect
 
06:07:59.510 --> 06:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
has been a windfall and
 
06:08:01.830 --> 06:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
a survival mechanism especially for the
 
06:08:01.840 --> 06:08:03.030 align:start position:0%
a survival mechanism especially for the
last

06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
06:08:05.270 --> 06:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
the last year during this covid crisis
 
06:08:07.670 --> 06:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
all other fundraisers dried up typical
 
06:08:09.510 --> 06:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
funds that were coming in every year the
 
06:08:11.110 --> 06:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
fundraisers weren't able to be had
 
06:08:13.030 --> 06:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
because of covert restrictions
 
06:08:14.390 --> 06:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've been able to with the charitable
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
gaming survive quite frankly and that
 
06:08:18.150 --> 06:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
money has been able to
 
06:08:19.830 --> 06:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
help keep the programs running and keep
 
06:08:21.430 --> 06:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
the people in need running those
 
06:08:21.440 --> 06:08:23.350 align:start position:0%
the people in need running those
programs

06:08:23.350 --> 06:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
programs
 
06:08:24.868 --> 06:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk real quick about my
 
06:08:27.270 --> 06:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
role as a police chief in my perspective
 
06:08:29.270 --> 06:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
from that lens because i think
 
06:08:30.628 --> 06:08:30.638 align:start position:0%
it's a unique perspective and you need
 
06:08:32.310 --> 06:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
to understand it
 
06:08:34.390 --> 06:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
as a police chief as you've heard all
 
06:08:34.400 --> 06:08:35.430 align:start position:0%
as a police chief as you've heard all
the

06:08:35.430 --> 06:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:08:37.270 --> 06:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
noise across the country about law
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement reform and the need for
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
social workers to be participating more
 
06:08:41.520 --> 06:08:42.390 align:start position:0%
social workers to be participating more
in

06:08:42.390 --> 06:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:08:44.150 --> 06:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
how how people are helped through mental
 
06:08:44.160 --> 06:08:45.190 align:start position:0%
how how people are helped through mental
health

06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%

assault sexual assault victims
 
06:08:52.150 --> 06:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
we as police officers respond to the
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
immediacy of those situations and what
 
06:08:55.590 --> 06:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
that means is we get a call we go and
 
06:08:56.708 --> 06:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
06:08:58.628 --> 06:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
and we basically make sure everybody is
 
06:08:58.638 --> 06:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
and we basically make sure everybody is
safe

06:08:59.910 --> 06:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
at that time what we then do is we do
 
06:09:04.070 --> 06:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
what we call a warm handoff to a social
 
06:09:06.070 --> 06:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
service agency for the experts that can
 
06:09:09.190 --> 06:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
handle it in nashua as many communities
 
06:09:10.868 --> 06:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
those social service agencies are
 
06:09:13.030 --> 06:09:13.040 align:start position:0%

06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
have margarites places transitional

can't afford to pay social workers for
 
06:09:36.548 --> 06:09:36.558 align:start position:0%
all the different types of situations
 
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
that come
 
06:09:41.030 --> 06:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
come across our my desk on a daily basis
 
06:09:42.868 --> 06:09:42.878 align:start position:0%
all the needs of all the people
 
06:09:44.628 --> 06:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
the nonprofits in nashville do that we
 
06:09:46.548 --> 06:09:46.558 align:start position:0%
have those relationships with them so
 
06:09:48.230 --> 06:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
when we handle something immediately we
 
06:09:49.750 --> 06:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to get them to the
 
06:09:51.590 --> 06:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
experts to get people the help that they
 
06:09:53.670 --> 06:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
need at really very little cost to the
 
06:09:55.430 --> 06:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
state and that's something you all need
 
06:09:57.590 --> 06:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
to to remember these are volunteer
 
06:09:59.750 --> 06:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
dollars going to nonprofits that do the
 
06:10:01.510 --> 06:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
work that the state would have to do to
 
06:10:02.868 --> 06:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
keep all these people and give them the
 
06:10:04.788 --> 06:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
resources they need
 
06:10:07.590 --> 06:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
so i i would appreciate that that
 
06:10:09.190 --> 06:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
perspective that you take into account
 
06:10:11.350 --> 06:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
how valuable those nonprofits are and
 
06:10:14.390 --> 06:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
how necessary that charitable gaming is
 
06:10:16.708 --> 06:10:16.718 align:start position:0%
for us to run those um as as i'm
 
06:10:17.910 --> 06:10:17.920 align:start position:0%

for many many years and we've heard a
 
06:11:20.868 --> 06:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
number of times that uh charitable
 
06:11:23.910 --> 06:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
gaming or gaming in in general can put a
 
06:11:27.750 --> 06:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
strain on on policing um
 
06:11:27.760 --> 06:11:28.628 align:start position:0%
strain on on policing um
and

06:11:28.628 --> 06:11:28.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
an increase on call volume etc have you
 
06:11:34.070 --> 06:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
experienced anything of the sort in in
 
06:11:36.470 --> 06:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
nashua or in your experience as a law
 
06:11:39.190 --> 06:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer chief thank you
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question sir i've been
 
06:11:43.750 --> 06:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
a police officer for about 28 years and
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't had turtle gaming that whole
 
06:11:47.190 --> 06:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
time but we've had them in nashville we
 
06:11:49.990 --> 06:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
now have three gaming facilities and
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
they're spread out through three
 
06:11:51.200 --> 06:11:52.230 align:start position:0%
they're spread out through three
different

06:11:52.230 --> 06:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
dynamics economic dynamics within the
 
06:11:56.230 --> 06:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
city some downtown some out in in
 
06:11:58.708 --> 06:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
quieter sectors we have not had any
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
increase in call volume to any of them
 
06:12:04.150 --> 06:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
nor have we had an increase to any types
 
06:12:06.628 --> 06:12:06.638 align:start position:0%
of calls for those in fact i'd say it's
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
quite the opposite i think um the the
 
06:12:11.350 --> 06:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
active participation that they have
 
06:12:13.670 --> 06:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
has helped us
 
06:12:15.830 --> 06:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the community partners that they are
 
06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
has actually lowered our lowered our
 
06:12:19.110 --> 06:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
costs and lowered our responses because
 
06:12:21.030 --> 06:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
it affords us the opportunity to work
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
like i was saying before to some of the
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
more nonprofits and let them get to the
 
06:12:28.868 --> 06:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
again thank you chief thank you anybody
 
06:12:33.590 --> 06:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
else pushing to speak i don't see any
 
06:12:34.948 --> 06:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
raised hands
 
06:12:36.230 --> 06:12:36.240 align:start position:0%

i'm from home health and hospice care
 
06:13:56.230 --> 06:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're a non-profit visiting nurse
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
association and hospice we own the
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
community hospice house in merrimack
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
now one of only two hospice houses in
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
the state
 
06:14:10.310 --> 06:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
for well over a century our mission has
 
06:14:12.788 --> 06:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
been to care for people whatever their
 
06:14:15.110 --> 06:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
financial circumstances
 
06:14:17.910 --> 06:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
and many of our patients come to us
 
06:14:21.430 --> 06:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
without insurance or resources
 
06:14:24.070 --> 06:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
we rely on the generosity of a caring
 
06:14:26.788 --> 06:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
community to do our work
 
06:14:30.150 --> 06:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
but it is always a challenge
 
06:14:32.628 --> 06:14:32.638 align:start position:0%
i hardly need to tell you
 
06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
that this last year
 
06:14:36.708 --> 06:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
has been more challenging
 
06:14:40.150 --> 06:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
especially at the hospice house
 
06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
where we believe that dying patients
 
06:14:44.868 --> 06:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
should be able to hold the hands of
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
their loved ones as life comes to a
 
06:14:47.760 --> 06:14:49.590 align:start position:0%
their loved ones as life comes to a
close

06:14:49.590 --> 06:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
close
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
thankfully we have been able
 
06:14:55.350 --> 06:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
to facilitate that mercy
 
06:14:58.230 --> 06:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
because of the large contribution
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
from our week of charitable gaming
 
06:15:02.788 --> 06:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
that bought
 
06:15:04.868 --> 06:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
the expensive
 
06:15:07.270 --> 06:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
and extensive
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
amount of ppe's that have been necessary
 
06:15:14.868 --> 06:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
to protect our line staff
 
06:15:18.150 --> 06:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
while still allowing family members
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
to visit the bedside
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
as we speak today
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
hams at the community hospice house are
 
06:15:29.990 --> 06:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
still being held and memories are being
 
06:15:30.000 --> 06:15:30.868 align:start position:0%
still being held and memories are being
made

06:15:30.868 --> 06:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
made
 
06:15:32.708 --> 06:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
and not through

came in a year when all of our
 
06:15:47.190 --> 06:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
fundraising events had to be cancelled
 
06:15:50.070 --> 06:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
the money we gratefully received
 
06:15:53.590 --> 06:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
directly impacted families
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
all over our service area

06:16:02.948 --> 06:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
time of trial
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
and to meet this trial
 
06:16:08.830 --> 06:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
we need lawmakers who will recognize the
 
06:16:12.548 --> 06:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
moment and the urgency
 
06:16:14.948 --> 06:16:14.958 align:start position:0%

to new hampshire's non-profits

percent
 
06:19:46.788 --> 06:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh and and that's really alarming and
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're working on trying to figure out
 
06:19:52.708 --> 06:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
how to uh impact that
 
06:19:57.190 --> 06:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
also a number of people who have mism
 
06:19:59.190 --> 06:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
who aren't eating if we don't send them
 
06:20:02.628 --> 06:20:02.638 align:start position:0%

06:20:04.628 --> 06:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
gone up from 16
 
06:20:04.638 --> 06:20:06.150 align:start position:0%
gone up from 16
28

06:20:06.150 --> 06:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
28
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh there there is a huge need for our
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
services i sympathize with all of the
 
06:20:13.350 --> 06:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
non-profits out there who are doing a
 
06:20:14.948 --> 06:20:14.958 align:start position:0%
wonderful job
 
06:20:14.958 --> 06:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
wonderful job
uh

06:20:15.830 --> 06:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
this extra money that would come in from
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing we estimate would
 
06:20:22.548 --> 06:20:22.558 align:start position:0%
give us anywhere between
 
06:20:25.110 --> 06:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
would help subsidize anywhere between
 
06:20:29.190 --> 06:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
five to ten thousand additional meals
 
06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
and we we also anticipate the need to
 
06:20:33.270 --> 06:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
grow so this is a great opportunity to
 
06:20:34.230 --> 06:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
help us
 
06:20:36.390 --> 06:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
serve those extra people
 
06:20:36.400 --> 06:20:37.110 align:start position:0%
serve those extra people
uh

06:20:37.110 --> 06:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:20:37.120 --> 06:20:37.910 align:start position:0%
uh
and

06:20:37.910 --> 06:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:39.910 --> 06:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
as a as a another note we have to
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
fundraise a third of our budget
 
06:20:43.590 --> 06:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
06:20:45.670 --> 06:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal funding just doesn't
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
cut it
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh and so we support charitable gaming
 
06:20:51.350 --> 06:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we support historic horse racing and
 
06:20:53.430 --> 06:20:53.440 align:start position:0%

06:23:13.350 --> 06:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
long hearing and i will be
 
06:23:16.470 --> 06:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 626 will provide
 
06:23:23.430 --> 06:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:25.590 --> 06:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
something that the charity gaming
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
facilities today can offer that we don't
 
06:23:31.190 --> 06:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
have that allows will allow us to
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
compete with the out-of-state casinos
 
06:23:33.120 --> 06:23:34.150 align:start position:0%
compete with the out-of-state casinos
that

06:23:34.150 --> 06:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:23:35.910 --> 06:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
that we do compete with
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
and as you heard charlie mcintyre say
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
when encore initially opened charity
 
06:23:44.708 --> 06:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
gaming in new hampshire took a major hit
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of revenue
 
06:23:50.708 --> 06:23:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:53.190 --> 06:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
stabilized a bit right now because of
 
06:23:55.430 --> 06:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
the covet situation the fact that
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
encores was down for a while and now
 
06:24:00.868 --> 06:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
they're operating part-time and they're
 
06:24:03.510 --> 06:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
not offering poker but that's all going
 
06:24:05.430 --> 06:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
to change one of these days and we'll be
 
06:24:09.350 --> 06:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
back to losing the revenue that we saw
 
06:24:11.590 --> 06:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
that we have the evidence to show you
 
06:24:14.470 --> 06:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we saw when they first opened
 
06:24:14.480 --> 06:24:15.830 align:start position:0%
that we saw when they first opened
um

06:24:15.830 --> 06:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:15.840 --> 06:24:17.430 align:start position:0%
um
we

06:24:17.430 --> 06:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:24:19.510 --> 06:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
the one thing missing in charity gaming
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
06:24:23.750 --> 06:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
is an electronic offering we do not have
 
06:24:26.628 --> 06:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
that we have we can compete with ten
 
06:24:29.590 --> 06:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
dollar blackjack and roulette and craps
 
06:24:31.910 --> 06:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have all in poker table stakes poker
 
06:24:34.230 --> 06:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
but we don't have anything to offer the
 
06:24:38.628 --> 06:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
player that wants an electronic game
 
06:24:41.350 --> 06:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
i find it ironic
 
06:24:41.360 --> 06:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
i find it ironic
that

06:24:44.070 --> 06:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
we have opposition from churchill downs
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
for this churchill downs as you know
 
06:24:51.510 --> 06:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
owns oxford casino in maine
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
obviously they know that
 
06:24:53.440 --> 06:24:54.788 align:start position:0%
obviously they know that
uh

06:24:54.788 --> 06:24:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:56.470 --> 06:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
this bill will help new hampshire
 
06:24:58.390 --> 06:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
charity gaming which means an impact on
 
06:25:01.510 --> 06:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
them but i here's the irony
 
06:25:01.520 --> 06:25:02.390 align:start position:0%
them but i here's the irony
while

06:25:02.390 --> 06:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
while
 
06:25:04.150 --> 06:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
oxford today
 
06:25:06.708 --> 06:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
churchill downs lobbyist is in new
 
06:25:09.190 --> 06:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire opposing this bill
 
06:25:11.190 --> 06:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
they have another lobbyist in kentucky
 
06:25:14.150 --> 06:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
supporting the exact same legislation
 
06:25:14.160 --> 06:25:15.110 align:start position:0%
supporting the exact same legislation
so

06:25:15.110 --> 06:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:17.270 --> 06:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
kentucky senate two days ago
 
06:25:20.628 --> 06:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
passed legislation to authorize
 
06:25:22.708 --> 06:25:22.718 align:start position:0%
historic racing and the house of
 
06:25:25.350 --> 06:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
representatives is dealing with it uh
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday and today so churchill
 
06:25:28.160 --> 06:25:29.030 align:start position:0%
yesterday and today so churchill
uh

06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:25:29.040 --> 06:25:30.390 align:start position:0%
uh
is

06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:25:32.230 --> 06:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill before they oppose
 
06:25:32.240 --> 06:25:32.868 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill before they oppose
it

06:25:32.868 --> 06:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:25:35.110 --> 06:25:35.120 align:start position:0%

present the self-interest of our clients
 
06:25:42.548 --> 06:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
but i think the committee should be
 
06:25:42.558 --> 06:25:43.510 align:start position:0%
but i think the committee should be
aware

06:25:43.510 --> 06:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
aware
 
06:25:45.990 --> 06:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
that the opposition to this coming from
 
06:25:50.788 --> 06:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
oxford is because of their self-interest
 
06:25:53.910 --> 06:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
um they are here opposing this bill
 
06:25:56.548 --> 06:25:56.558 align:start position:0%

06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
of how much in total has gone maybe
 
06:26:36.070 --> 06:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis to all the charities
 
06:26:38.310 --> 06:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
that have run through these 16
 
06:26:41.190 --> 06:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming sites
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
are you saying i'm talking about since a
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
charity gaming law was passed in 2006
 
06:26:47.670 --> 06:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
well even just one year would give us a
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
ballpark figure sure um
 
06:26:50.160 --> 06:26:50.948 align:start position:0%
ballpark figure sure um
the

06:26:50.948 --> 06:26:50.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:26:52.868 --> 06:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
charity gaming in new hampshire
 
06:26:55.830 --> 06:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
generates uh about four million dollars
 
06:26:57.670 --> 06:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
a year for the charities
 
06:27:00.230 --> 06:27:00.240 align:start position:0%

06:30:32.868 --> 06:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
what page
 
06:30:34.628 --> 06:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
i think my mind is sort of mine is
 
06:30:36.150 --> 06:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
sorted by uh
 
06:30:37.590 --> 06:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
people who want to speak i think yours
 
06:30:40.230 --> 06:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
is maybe mixed i haven't the fourth
 
06:30:42.708 --> 06:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
fourth person down on my list
 
06:30:45.430 --> 06:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
fourth person now on this list
 
06:30:47.510 --> 06:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
is a tony
 
06:30:50.788 --> 06:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
is a patrick nealy
 
06:30:52.548 --> 06:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i got a different sort she
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
sorted it
 
06:30:56.390 --> 06:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
for me uh jennifer it's ordered for me
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh just for the people who wanted to
 
06:30:57.680 --> 06:30:58.708 align:start position:0%
uh just for the people who wanted to
testify

06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:31:01.110 --> 06:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
so my list must be sort of different
 
06:31:03.750 --> 06:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:07.430 --> 06:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
so those must be a new or less then
 
06:31:09.350 --> 06:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
she ran it she ran it for me about half
 
06:31:11.510 --> 06:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
hour before we started this morning
 
06:31:16.390 --> 06:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:18.070 --> 06:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to be the official list
 
06:31:18.080 --> 06:31:18.830 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to be the official list
right

06:31:18.830 --> 06:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:31:21.110 --> 06:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
here i think the way around this form is
 
06:31:22.788 --> 06:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
just to ask if anybody else who wants to
 
06:31:22.798 --> 06:31:25.190 align:start position:0%
just to ask if anybody else who wants to
testify

06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:31:28.070 --> 06:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
but peter breitner does not appear to be
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
on my list but it is on your list
 
06:31:32.628 --> 06:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
representative major i'm sorry to
 
06:31:35.510 --> 06:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
interrupt but um mr bragdon did get in
 
06:31:35.520 --> 06:31:36.390 align:start position:0%
interrupt but um mr bragdon did get in
touch

06:31:36.390 --> 06:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
touch
 
06:31:38.548 --> 06:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
he did not sign up before the eight
 
06:31:40.468 --> 06:31:40.478 align:start position:0%
o'clock deadline but he did indicate
 
06:31:42.230 --> 06:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
that he'd like to
 
06:31:45.510 --> 06:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
um testify on these bills
 
06:31:48.390 --> 06:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's not on my list
 
06:31:48.400 --> 06:31:50.468 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's not on my list
yep

06:31:50.468 --> 06:31:50.478 align:start position:0%
yep
 
06:31:50.478 --> 06:31:51.830 align:start position:0%
yep
okay

06:31:51.830 --> 06:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:31:54.628 --> 06:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:56.948 --> 06:31:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative major i believe in in mr
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
brogdon's earlier testimony from today
 
06:32:01.750 --> 06:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
on another bill he did say he intended
 
06:32:03.110 --> 06:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
06:32:07.990 --> 06:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:11.190 --> 06:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
but he had he didn't testify here
 
06:32:13.750 --> 06:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
but according to that
 
06:32:16.468 --> 06:32:16.478 align:start position:0%
it's on pat's list
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:25.830 --> 06:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:25.840 --> 06:32:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:32:30.390 --> 06:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:32.390 --> 06:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
where is it
 
06:32:35.030 --> 06:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
let him come in i'll talk to him
 
06:32:39.350 --> 06:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:41.270 --> 06:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
would you like to take representative
 
06:32:43.110 --> 06:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
ames and bursting's
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions first i want to take care of
 
06:32:51.990 --> 06:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:53.750 --> 06:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
mr bragging
 
06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
06:32:57.670 --> 06:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee i i had signed up at 8 30 i
 
06:33:00.310 --> 06:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
didn't realize the deadline was eight um
 
06:33:02.468 --> 06:33:02.478 align:start position:0%
the senate deadline is half hour before
 
06:33:04.390 --> 06:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
the hearings start in the morning so my
 
06:33:05.750 --> 06:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
apologies for
 
06:33:08.548 --> 06:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
uh coming in late so
 
06:33:10.468 --> 06:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
are you in favor of this bill or
 
06:33:13.110 --> 06:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill uh opposed to the bill
 
06:33:14.948 --> 06:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
and uh if you have two minutes i'll
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
explain why
 
06:33:18.948 --> 06:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
one minute
 
06:33:21.830 --> 06:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay good so um as i mentioned before
 
06:33:23.590 --> 06:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
churchill downs has gaming facilities in
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
nine states uh we
 
06:33:27.990 --> 06:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
operate table games various electronic
 
06:33:30.468 --> 06:33:30.478 align:start position:0%
games um and obviously because of that
 
06:33:32.548 --> 06:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
we keep an eye on opportunities across
 
06:33:35.030 --> 06:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the country so you may be surprised some
 
06:33:36.708 --> 06:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
of you to learn that churchill downs as
 
06:33:39.110 --> 06:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to hb626
 
06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
and against what mr newman just told you
 
06:33:44.708 --> 06:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
there's not the exact same bill being
 
06:33:46.948 --> 06:33:46.958 align:start position:0%
considered in kentucky
 
06:33:48.708 --> 06:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
in fact that's the primary reason for
 
06:33:51.510 --> 06:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
our opposition because even though house
 
06:33:54.070 --> 06:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill 626 makes historic racing machines
 
06:33:56.310 --> 06:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
more lucrative to the operators than
 
06:33:58.150 --> 06:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
other gaming in new hampshire
 
06:34:00.390 --> 06:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean currently charities
 
06:34:02.708 --> 06:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
get 35 percent of what's left over after
 
06:34:04.628 --> 06:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
winnings are paid to player with the
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
state getting 10 the operating in 55.
 
06:34:09.830 --> 06:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
with this bill the charities rate drops
 
06:34:12.788 --> 06:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
from 35 of what's left after prizes to
 
06:34:14.948 --> 06:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
eight and three quarters percent and
 
06:34:16.390 --> 06:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
then they got to split that with another
 
06:34:18.390 --> 06:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
charity so maybe you're down to four or
 
06:34:20.150 --> 06:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
something but let's say it drops it to
 
06:34:22.390 --> 06:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
eight and three quarters percent so it
 
06:34:23.910 --> 06:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
becomes much more lucrative for the
 
06:34:26.548 --> 06:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
operators uh therefore their uh position
 
06:34:29.110 --> 06:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
of what's left over goes from 55 to 75
 
06:34:32.788 --> 06:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
percent mr brighton yep can you prepare
 
06:34:34.390 --> 06:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
a letter
 
06:34:36.310 --> 06:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
for the rest of it and i think this is
 
06:34:37.830 --> 06:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
very important mr chair if you look at
 
06:34:41.350 --> 06:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
page 2 line 22 it says only operators
 
06:34:43.190 --> 06:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
that hold the license in new hampshire
 
06:34:45.910 --> 06:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
on may 1st 2020 would be allowed to
 
06:34:48.628 --> 06:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
operate historic racing machines this is
 
06:34:50.548 --> 06:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
a restriction on new entries in the
 
06:34:52.628 --> 06:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
market gives existing operators a
 
06:34:54.868 --> 06:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
four-year window with no new entries
 
06:34:57.030 --> 06:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
gives a head start a significant period
 
06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
entry it's uh the existing operators
 
06:35:02.070 --> 06:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
don't want the competition they want the
 
06:35:03.830 --> 06:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
state to pick winners and losers and
 
06:35:05.350 --> 06:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
they believe that gaming consumers and
 
06:35:07.430 --> 06:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
charities don't deserve a choice
 
06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
this exclusion wasn't in prior versions
 
06:35:11.030 --> 06:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the bills these bills started in
 
06:35:11.040 --> 06:35:12.548 align:start position:0%
of the bills these bills started in
2009.

06:35:12.548 --> 06:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
2009.
 
06:35:14.868 --> 06:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
this exclusion appeared last year after
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
churchill down started asking questions
 
06:35:19.750 --> 06:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire mr brighton
 
06:35:19.760 --> 06:35:20.628 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire mr brighton
this

06:35:20.628 --> 06:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
this hearing's been going on since one
 
06:35:22.478 --> 06:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
this hearing's been going on since one
o'clock

06:35:23.510 --> 06:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
i've checked the attending list i've
 
06:35:27.350 --> 06:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
never seen you
 
06:35:29.590 --> 06:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
raise your hand the hearing is just
 
06:35:31.270 --> 06:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
about over and all of a sudden you're
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
coming in at the end
 
06:35:35.910 --> 06:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
could you prepare what you want us to
 
06:35:37.350 --> 06:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
know because we're going to have a work
 
06:35:39.430 --> 06:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
session on it and
 
06:35:41.430 --> 06:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
provide it to us
 
06:35:43.510 --> 06:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
we need to move on
 
06:35:49.030 --> 06:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:52.868 --> 06:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:57.270 --> 06:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:00.230 --> 06:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i recovered everybody that wanted to
 
06:36:00.240 --> 06:36:01.670 align:start position:0%
and i recovered everybody that wanted to
testify

06:36:01.670 --> 06:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:36:03.990 --> 06:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm closing the public hearing on
 
06:36:05.230 --> 06:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
06:36:05.240 --> 06:36:07.110 align:start position:0%
house bill
626

06:36:07.110 --> 06:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
626
 
06:36:09.030 --> 06:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
and we will be opening the public
 
06:36:09.040 --> 06:36:11.830 align:start position:0%
and we will be opening the public
hearing

06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
06:36:14.400 --> 06:36:16.788 align:start position:0%
on house bill
cacr1

06:36:16.788 --> 06:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
cacr1
 
06:36:19.030 --> 06:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think this will be very long
 
06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
because i have a list
 
06:36:22.390 --> 06:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
of about
 
06:36:24.150 --> 06:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
100 and
 
06:36:26.310 --> 06:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
something names
 
06:36:26.320 --> 06:36:27.990 align:start position:0%
something names
and

06:36:27.990 --> 06:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:29.910 --> 06:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
none of them had indicated they want to
 
06:36:29.920 --> 06:36:31.830 align:start position:0%
none of them had indicated they want to
testify

06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
testify
 
06:36:33.590 --> 06:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
but they
 
06:36:37.830 --> 06:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
87 of them oppose the acr one 17 support
 
06:36:39.430 --> 06:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
it and
 
06:36:42.708 --> 06:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
fall on the fine sponsor
 
06:36:44.948 --> 06:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
06:36:48.110 --> 06:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:51.430 --> 06:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
cacr1 which provides that an income tax
 
06:36:53.350 --> 06:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
on earned personal income shall be
 
06:36:53.360 --> 06:36:54.708 align:start position:0%
on earned personal income shall be
prohibited

06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
06:36:58.708 --> 06:36:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
muted here am i unmuted
 
06:37:03.670 --> 06:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
yes you are okay thank you mr chairman
 
06:37:07.030 --> 06:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the time here uh this will be
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
like you said pretty straightforward
 
06:37:10.310 --> 06:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's there's no great mystery here it
 
06:37:13.430 --> 06:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
simply says we'll not have an income tax
 
06:37:13.440 --> 06:37:14.708 align:start position:0%
simply says we'll not have an income tax
um

06:37:14.708 --> 06:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:16.708 --> 06:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
i think that uh it would be a
 
06:37:18.468 --> 06:37:18.478 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment if we look back
 
06:37:20.468 --> 06:37:20.478 align:start position:0%
we've uh over the last uh
 
06:37:22.310 --> 06:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
200 and something years we've done
 
06:37:24.310 --> 06:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
without a broad-based income tax in new
 
06:37:26.468 --> 06:37:26.478 align:start position:0%
hampshire and we've managed quite well i
 
06:37:28.468 --> 06:37:28.478 align:start position:0%
think the events of the last year show
 
06:37:28.478 --> 06:37:29.350 align:start position:0%
think the events of the last year show
that

06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:37:31.110 --> 06:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
even though we had this horrible
 
06:37:32.868 --> 06:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic and all sorts of challenges
 
06:37:34.708 --> 06:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
again we managed to get through it
 
06:37:37.750 --> 06:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
without an income tax and states around
 
06:37:40.230 --> 06:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
us uh that had plenty of income tax
 
06:37:42.230 --> 06:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
didn't do as well as we did i have
 
06:37:43.830 --> 06:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
relatives down in massachusetts and i
 
06:37:45.110 --> 06:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
can tell you they're still fighting to
 
06:37:47.670 --> 06:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
get the first batch of uh vaccines even
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
though they're
 
06:37:51.830 --> 06:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the first category due to age or
 
06:37:53.110 --> 06:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
illness but
 
06:37:54.708 --> 06:37:54.718 align:start position:0%
i just don't see any need for it i think
 
06:37:56.070 --> 06:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's time we went up and stood up and
 
06:37:56.080 --> 06:37:57.030 align:start position:0%
it's time we went up and stood up and
said

06:37:57.030 --> 06:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
said
 
06:37:59.030 --> 06:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh let's let the voters decide once and
 
06:38:00.310 --> 06:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
for all we want to put it in the
 
06:38:02.868 --> 06:38:02.878 align:start position:0%
constitution i can remember reading
 
06:38:05.590 --> 06:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
something uh in the newspaper oh i don't
 
06:38:07.830 --> 06:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
know 30 years ago or something about an
 
06:38:10.310 --> 06:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
article that was reprinted from the 19 i
 
06:38:12.948 --> 06:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
think was 1950 saying that a broad-based
 
06:38:15.030 --> 06:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
tax in new hampshire is inevitable it's
 
06:38:17.590 --> 06:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen well it hasn't and it
 
06:38:19.190 --> 06:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to happen
 
06:38:20.788 --> 06:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
and it's just quite as simple as that
 
06:38:22.948 --> 06:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
we've got a wrong track record of
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
proving we don't need an income tax so
 
06:38:26.390 --> 06:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
let's put it in the constitution so
 
06:38:28.230 --> 06:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
instead of having a battle over it every
 
06:38:30.310 --> 06:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
two years or four years we can put it in
 
06:38:32.548 --> 06:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
the past and move on to other things and
 
06:38:34.788 --> 06:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
i'll gladly take any questions
 
06:38:36.868 --> 06:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
questions for mr uh representative
 
06:38:36.878 --> 06:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
questions for mr uh representative
harrington

06:38:37.990 --> 06:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
harrington
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh president
 
06:38:42.468 --> 06:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
representative romney i just want to
 
06:38:45.270 --> 06:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
remind everybody including the uh uh uh
 
06:38:46.868 --> 06:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
for harrington
 
06:38:49.670 --> 06:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
we we passed this uh
 
06:38:52.708 --> 06:38:52.718 align:start position:0%
years ago my first term i guess it was
 
06:38:52.718 --> 06:38:53.590 align:start position:0%
years ago my first term i guess it was
uh

06:38:53.590 --> 06:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:38:55.430 --> 06:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the past senate and it did go to the
 
06:38:55.440 --> 06:38:56.628 align:start position:0%
in the past senate and it did go to the
people

06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:38:56.638 --> 06:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
people
uh

06:38:57.430 --> 06:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:01.190 --> 06:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it was the vote was 58 in favor of
 
06:39:03.030 --> 06:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
this constitutional amendment
 
06:39:05.590 --> 06:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
and i used to characterize that as a a
 
06:39:07.750 --> 06:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
real-time real
 
06:39:07.760 --> 06:39:08.788 align:start position:0%
real-time real
poll

06:39:08.788 --> 06:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
poll
 
06:39:10.548 --> 06:39:10.558 align:start position:0%
of what people thought obviously didn't
 
06:39:12.708 --> 06:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
make the two-thirds threshold that's
 
06:39:14.230 --> 06:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
required for a constitutional amendment
 
06:39:17.110 --> 06:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
to pass it made a 60 threshold in the
 
06:39:18.788 --> 06:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
house in the senate though
 
06:39:20.070 --> 06:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
06:39:22.390 --> 06:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
06:39:23.430 --> 06:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
again i
 
06:39:23.440 --> 06:39:25.110 align:start position:0%
again i
uh

06:39:25.110 --> 06:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:27.190 --> 06:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
would you view this as if anything it'd
 
06:39:29.430 --> 06:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
be a good way to poll to people if they
 
06:39:31.910 --> 06:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
still feel the same way to put to bed
 
06:39:33.350 --> 06:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
once again
 
06:39:34.628 --> 06:39:34.638 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
06:39:36.310 --> 06:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire want to see
 
06:39:37.990 --> 06:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
an income tax
 
06:39:39.990 --> 06:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
well i think as you said that was in the
 
06:39:42.868 --> 06:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
past and every year every biennium that
 
06:39:44.628 --> 06:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
we go through every crisis like the
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we go through within
 
06:39:48.948 --> 06:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
without an income tax only proves more
 
06:39:51.350 --> 06:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't need one and i think that
 
06:39:54.230 --> 06:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
given that there's a good chance and i
 
06:39:55.990 --> 06:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
can't predict what we're going to do it
 
06:39:57.430 --> 06:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
needs a two-thirds majority of the
 
06:39:59.030 --> 06:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
people but let's get it out there and
 
06:40:02.310 --> 06:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
let them have a chance to vote on it
 
06:40:03.190 --> 06:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:05.830 --> 06:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:07.990 --> 06:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
further questions of mr heron
 
06:40:12.548 --> 06:40:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:14.628 --> 06:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
see no further questions
 
06:40:17.590 --> 06:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm going to ask one
 
06:40:20.070 --> 06:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
what's in sucker
 
06:40:21.830 --> 06:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh do you feel uh representative
 
06:40:24.070 --> 06:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
harrington that the
 
06:40:25.670 --> 06:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
question of how we're going to have
 
06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
equitable education
 
06:40:31.510 --> 06:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
06:40:33.190 --> 06:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
and the kind of work that's been done in
 
06:40:35.190 --> 06:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
the last year that shows
 
06:40:37.670 --> 06:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
that there is vast inequities
 
06:40:39.990 --> 06:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the kind of education that youngsters
 
06:40:43.030 --> 06:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
receive here do you think that will
 
06:40:45.990 --> 06:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
change people's minds over time that
 
06:40:49.030 --> 06:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps they want to leave it open to
 
06:40:51.110 --> 06:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that someday there might be an
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
06:40:55.030 --> 06:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question uh i
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
really don't know all i can say is the
 
06:40:59.990 --> 06:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
idea of the uh who thinks the education
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
fundings are inequitable and what the
 
06:41:04.548 --> 06:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
problems and issues are have been around
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
as long as i've been in the legislature
 
06:41:07.990 --> 06:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
going back to the early 2000s and
 
06:41:10.150 --> 06:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
actually as long as i've been in new
 
06:41:11.350 --> 06:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire which goes back quite a bit
 
06:41:12.948 --> 06:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
earlier than that so
 
06:41:14.390 --> 06:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know and i'm not trying to i'm
 
06:41:16.230 --> 06:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
not going to judge for the people but i
 
06:41:17.990 --> 06:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
think that it's an issue that we should
 
06:41:21.590 --> 06:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
get out there and let them decide
 
06:41:22.390 --> 06:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:41:26.070 --> 06:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:30.628 --> 06:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:31.910 --> 06:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
and those
 
06:41:34.070 --> 06:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions we thank you mr uh

there's a lot of
 
06:41:55.110 --> 06:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:55.120 --> 06:41:56.230 align:start position:0%

the committee gets a copy of the sign up
 
06:42:04.240 --> 06:42:06.468 align:start position:0%
the committee gets a copy of the sign up
sheets

06:42:06.468 --> 06:42:06.478 align:start position:0%
sheets
 
06:42:09.190 --> 06:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
do you want me to read the names
 
06:42:09.200 --> 06:42:10.150 align:start position:0%
do you want me to read the names
no

06:42:10.150 --> 06:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:42:13.030 --> 06:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay as long as you have the copies
 
06:42:15.270 --> 06:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
and there's nobody here
 
06:42:18.150 --> 06:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
on this 100 and something
 
06:42:20.868 --> 06:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
that indicate they want to sign up uh
 
06:42:23.110 --> 06:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
06:42:27.590 --> 06:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:31.510 --> 06:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's nobody in the attendees
 
06:42:33.670 --> 06:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
i keep checking that attendees list
 
06:42:34.788 --> 06:42:34.798 align:start position:0%

tax we've never had one we don't need
 
06:44:20.070 --> 06:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
one uh and it's time we put it out for a
 
06:44:20.080 --> 06:44:20.868 align:start position:0%
one uh and it's time we put it out for a
vote

06:44:20.868 --> 06:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
vote
 
06:44:23.110 --> 06:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
i have had one couple of questions on
 
06:44:25.190 --> 06:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
this and that's not in effect january
 
06:44:27.830 --> 06:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
1st 2021 because there are some limited
 
06:44:30.230 --> 06:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
sales taxes in effect in the state now
 
06:44:31.750 --> 06:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
the one i specifically know about for
 
06:44:34.070 --> 06:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
example is the um
 
06:44:35.830 --> 06:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
sales tax on rental cars for example
 
06:44:37.110 --> 06:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
that would be one so that would not
 
06:44:38.548 --> 06:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
affect that one this would be going
 
06:44:40.230 --> 06:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
forward there could be new no new
 
06:44:41.830 --> 06:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax and like i said i'm not
 
06:44:43.430 --> 06:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to waste your time by repeating
 
06:44:45.270 --> 06:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
the arguments i just gave for the sale
 
06:44:46.868 --> 06:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
for the income tax because it's exactly
 
06:44:48.150 --> 06:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
the same for these and i'll be glad to
 
06:44:50.708 --> 06:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
06:44:51.910 --> 06:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:44:53.750 --> 06:44:53.760 align:start position:0%

06:45:20.070 --> 06:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this apply also to our our
 
06:45:23.430 --> 06:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
whole rooms and meals tax to the tobacco
 
06:45:26.230 --> 06:45:26.240 align:start position:0%

06:45:36.798 --> 06:45:38.150 align:start position:0%
or or those considered to be not sales
taxes

06:45:38.150 --> 06:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
06:45:39.270 --> 06:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question by the
 
06:45:40.708 --> 06:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
way i've been called a lot worse than mr
 
06:45:42.708 --> 06:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
harrington so don't worry about it
 
06:45:45.270 --> 06:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
but uh anything that was in effect prior
 
06:45:48.070 --> 06:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
to january 1st 2021 i would not be
 
06:45:50.868 --> 06:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
affected by this so the beer tax the
 
06:45:52.628 --> 06:45:52.638 align:start position:0%
room and meals tax i mentioned the
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
automobile rental tax any of those
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
things would not be affected by this
 
06:45:58.708 --> 06:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
this is going forward prohibition only
 
06:46:00.310 --> 06:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect anything that's already
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
enacted into law
 
06:46:05.430 --> 06:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i was confusing it with the
 
06:46:07.110 --> 06:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
other one the other one probably should
 
06:46:09.030 --> 06:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
have had this language too if it was
 
06:46:16.310 --> 06:46:16.320 align:start position:0%

education funds
 
06:49:23.990 --> 06:49:24.000 align:start position:0%

not been in it since there were children
 
06:49:26.478 --> 06:49:27.050 align:start position:0%

new high school was built
 
06:49:41.590 --> 06:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
50 or 60 years ago and uh so
 
06:49:46.628 --> 06:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:47.990 --> 06:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
you just brought me down memory lane
 
06:49:50.070 --> 06:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's all yeah
 
06:49:51.990 --> 06:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
i want to thank everybody for hanging in
 
06:49:55.270 --> 06:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
here just about everybody did hang in i
 
06:49:57.190 --> 06:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
i apologize for getting a little rough
 
06:49:59.270 --> 06:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
there at the end of the other
 
06:50:01.110 --> 06:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
name but
 
06:50:03.510 --> 06:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of upset me
 
06:50:03.520 --> 06:50:04.708 align:start position:0%
that kind of upset me
anyway

06:50:04.708 --> 06:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
06:50:04.718 --> 06:50:05.830 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

06:50:05.830 --> 06:50:05.840 align:start position:0%

anything else
 
06:51:33.670 --> 06:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
we will have these work sessions um
 
06:51:36.070 --> 06:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
we've got to analyze what the governor's
 
06:51:38.868 --> 06:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
budget did and
 
06:51:41.750 --> 06:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
we'll get together and discuss that
 
06:51:44.708 --> 06:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
so next week
 
06:51:44.718 --> 06:51:46.390 align:start position:0%
so next week
okay

06:51:46.390 --> 06:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:51:48.390 --> 06:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
06:51:52.390 --> 06:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
on i was just trying to estimate it for
 
06:51:53.990 --> 06:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
mary jane walner
 
06:51:56.468 --> 06:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
and on it doesn't look like the impact
 
06:51:56.478 --> 06:51:57.430 align:start position:0%
and on it doesn't look like the impact
is

06:51:57.430 --> 06:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:51:57.440 --> 06:51:58.628 align:start position:0%
is
huge

06:51:58.628 --> 06:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
huge
 
06:52:01.350 --> 06:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
as especially not as as the tax cut
 
06:52:03.670 --> 06:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
bills going through now
 
06:52:03.680 --> 06:52:05.270 align:start position:0%
bills going through now
but

06:52:05.270 --> 06:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:52:08.070 --> 06:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's one part of it that i think we
 
06:52:11.270 --> 06:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
are incapable of beginning to estimate
 
06:52:13.830 --> 06:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
that dra would be able to
 
06:52:17.670 --> 06:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
which is the reduction in the amount of
 
06:52:17.680 --> 06:52:18.628 align:start position:0%
which is the reduction in the amount of
money

06:52:18.628 --> 06:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
money
 
06:52:21.990 --> 06:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh of of the floor the increase of the
 
06:52:24.548 --> 06:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
floor for the bpt
 
06:52:25.948 --> 06:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
06:52:30.110 --> 06:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
150 enterprise level to
 
06:52:33.350 --> 06:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
250 enterprise level i don't think we've
 
06:52:35.910 --> 06:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
ever asked for an estimate of what that
 
06:52:35.920 --> 06:52:37.910 align:start position:0%
ever asked for an estimate of what that
does

06:52:37.910 --> 06:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
does
 
06:52:39.510 --> 06:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
we'll better look at
 
06:52:42.070 --> 06:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
what he's proposing and then we will be
 
06:52:45.030 --> 06:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
meeting with the budget director
 
06:52:47.190 --> 06:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
on the 18th
 
06:52:49.350 --> 06:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
so if we do our homework we should be
 
06:52:50.788 --> 06:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
able to ask them some pretty quick
 
06:52:50.798 --> 06:52:52.708 align:start position:0%
able to ask them some pretty quick
questions

06:52:52.708 --> 06:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
i was hoping maybe we could ask the dra
 
06:52:58.548 --> 06:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:58.558 --> 06:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
