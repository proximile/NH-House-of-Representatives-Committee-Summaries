anybody watching uh it was first held in

Republican and Democratic national
 
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
conventions in 1952 the first primary
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
were voters directly voted for
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
presidential candidates Dwight
 
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower upset Robert Taft since 1975
 
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
state law mandates that New Hampshire's
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
primary be held at least a week before
 
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
any similar contest and the legislature
 
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
entrusted the secretary of state with
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
authority to move that date to make sure
 
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
we stay first in the nation why is it
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
important not just for New Hampshire and
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
our tourist industry and our and our
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
vanity and our pride why is it important
 
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
for the nation New Hampshire voters
 
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 align:start position:0%
expect candidates to earn their votes
 
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
Grassroots campaigns Force candidates to
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
persuade voters making them better
 
00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 align:start position:0%
candidates and better prepared to serve
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
as president
 
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
winning in New Hampshire or having a
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
surprisingly good showing can help
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
candidates secure their party's
 
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
nomination a poor showing in New
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can end a struggling campaign
 
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
narrowing the field for the upcoming
 
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.030 align:start position:0%
narrowing the field for the upcoming
contests

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
contests
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
protecting the first in the nation
 
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
primary is important the current
 
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
challenge to our primary is not from
 
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
other states Delaware or Arizona or
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
Nevada as it has been in the past but
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
from Washington D.C
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
while the Republican National Committee
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
has confirmed New Hampshire's status the
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
Democratic National Committee wants us
 
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
to move other states in front of us and
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
threatens to not seat New Hampshire
 
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
delegates if we indeed stay first in
 
00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
line with state law in fact
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
last year the DNC sent this legislature
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
a list of changes to our state election
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
laws just to be considered for the third
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
or fourth plot in their calendar
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
cacr9 would give New Hampshire voters
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
the chance to cement our state's first
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
in the nation primary into the state
 
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
constitution this is more than merely
 
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
symbolic it would also protect the
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
primary from future demands that the
 
00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
legislature abandoned first in the
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
nation Senator Abbas thanks you for your
 
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 align:start position:0%

helpful to the Secretary of State's

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
he really knows the election laws better
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
than almost anybody else in the state of
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.370 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully including campaign Finance
 
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.669 align:start position:0%
hopefully including campaign Finance
laws

00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
the position of our office on campaign
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
Finance generally has been that it's the
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
realm of the legislature to determine
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance policy
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and and processes and we
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
administer uh
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
the laws that the legislature passes
 
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.730 align:start position:0%
the laws that the legislature passes
um

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
with that said I think over time the
 
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance laws have become
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
incredibly confusing
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
and complicated to the point that even
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
staff in my office have a difficult time
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know explaining how the law Works to
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
uh uh candidates and political
 
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.789 align:start position:0%
uh uh candidates and political
committees

00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
what I would like to see
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I am more than happy to help with
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
this effort personally you know through
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
the summer so that a bill could be
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
sponsored next year is to just
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
consolidate the different types of
 
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:25.820 align:start position:0%
political committees
 
00:21:29.169 --> 00:21:29.179 align:start position:0%
streamline the statute as much as we can
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
have simple
 
00:21:31.919 --> 00:21:33.789 align:start position:0%
have simple
uh

00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
contribution requirements
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
and you know the whole idea with
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance is transparency and
 
00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.289 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance is transparency and
disclosure

00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to be that
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
complicated we just you know if we if we
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
just have a one-size-fits all
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
approach that we can keep really simple
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's to the benefit
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
not only the people have to file these
 
00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:56.810 align:start position:0%
not only the people have to file these
reports

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
but also the people that want to view
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
them you know and understand how
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
campaigns are financed
 
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:06.500 align:start position:0%
and where the money is going
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
will benefit everyone
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
so I that's the thirty thousand foot
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
level of what I think the direction that
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
I think we should go I will say that at
 
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
the moment we are currently getting
 
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
ready to replace the campaign Finance uh
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
online filing system so this discussion
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
is Timely
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
we have already invited the political
 
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
parties to provide input uh into what
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
the new system should look like but I
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
think this exercise is a really
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
important part of that
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to turn this over to Bud
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
now because he has done a lot of the
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
work on the uh
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
on the details the detail part of the
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
statute send he'll have have some more
 
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.529 align:start position:0%
statute send he'll have have some more
specific

00:22:56.529 --> 00:22:56.539 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
comments and suggestions so Bud thank
 
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you committee I have
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
a handout for you if I can approach and
 
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
provide them with it you go to the mic
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
so there are is a lot of information in
 
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:43.460 align:start position:0%
the document that I've just handed out
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
it's intended to identify areas of the
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance law that we have
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
struggled with or we think it's so
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
complex that it might benefit from being
 
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
complex that it might benefit from being
simplified

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
simplified
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll proceed in any way you want to
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
um unless you direct something else I'll
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
just do a quick 30 000 foot overview of
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
this but not go into all the detail and
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
if you see an area that is of interest
 
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140 align:start position:0%
to you you can read the further detail
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
there and I'm happy to take questions at
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
any moment in time is that okay Mr
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
chairman that's fine that's good thank
 
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.510 align:start position:0%
chairman that's fine that's good thank
you

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
so the first issue secretary Scanlan
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
referred to is
 
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
there are nine different types of
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
registration if you parse the statute
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
and I've laid out in as much detail as I
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
can what they probably are
 
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
in many cases while there are Provisions
 
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
in the statute that create each of the
 
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.490 align:start position:0%
in the statute that create each of the
nine

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:36.500 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
and we try to construe them in a way
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
that makes each mutually exclusive of
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
the other I can tell you our experiences
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
that many of the people that use the
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
system people that file see the list of
 
00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
nine more as a a menu choice where they
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
get to pick and choose whichever one
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
they want to where in fact probably your
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
intent was or your predecessor's intent
 
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
in creating these was that a particular
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
individual or entity would only fit into
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
one of them and they would have to align
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
and there are components of them
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
where the definition is tied to a
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
particular amount of money either being
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
received or expended or received or
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
expended so some are both some are one
 
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
some of the other and so as I understand
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
the law they don't actually become a
 
00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:27.299 align:start position:0%
committee until they pass that threshold
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
so a political advocacy organization is
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
defined as an entity that spends five
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
thousand on explicit advocacy
 
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
Communications so even though they they
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
are subject to the reporting of
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
political committees and there's a law
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
that says political committees start
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
reporting when they hit a thousand
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
they're not a political committee so as
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
a lawyer I look at that as saying okay
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
the law has a two-part test
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
is it a political committee yes or no
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
and if it is then have they done have
 
00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
they either received or expended or both
 
00:25:58.620 --> 00:25:59.269 align:start position:0%
they either received or expended or both
um

00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
or either I should say the threshold
 
00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
amount of money so a political advocacy
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
organization as I understand the law
 
00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:07.700 align:start position:0%
would file its first report after
 
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
expending five thousand dollars and only
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
on that statutorily defined narrow form
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
of expenditures
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
one of the things you'll see that's
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
detailed in this is the question and I'm
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
not entirely I can as a lawyer I can
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
craft an answer in either direction does
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
a political advocacy organization it can
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
make contributions because your statute
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
sets a contribution limit for it but is
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
a contribution an explicit communication
 
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
you know we have the Buckley versus
 
00:26:39.049 --> 00:26:39.059 align:start position:0%
vileo line of federal cases that kind of
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
say money is speech but it's somewhat
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
unclear whether the legislature intends
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
that a political advocacy organization
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
which it said can make contributions
 
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
because you've set limitations on how
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
much they can provide whether that is
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
reportable and I think the most courts
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
that construe campaign Finance statutes
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
construe them like tax codes and other
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
things where unless it clearly requires
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
something that's not required this is
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
not you make your best guess so what
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're meant to do because it's
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
restrictive in their in nature
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
what the courts find is restricted is
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
just what the legislature has clearly
 
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.029 align:start position:0%
just what the legislature has clearly
defined

00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
so the first few pages just go through
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
the different types of
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
registrant types one area that I would
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look carefully at is
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
the distinctions between a candidate
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
filing as a candidate and a candidate
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
filing as a candidate committee
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
as we understand the law and I detail it
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
here there are some differences in terms
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
of how much they can give to somebody
 
00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:41.539 align:start position:0%
else and some other elements of the law
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
but and there are differences in when
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
they have to file reports I would
 
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
suggest a good question to think about
 
00:27:48.179 --> 00:27:49.130 align:start position:0%
suggest a good question to think about
is

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
what are the public policy benefits of
 
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
that distinction
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
and are they outweighed by the harm
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
caused by the confusion very common
 
00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
question is all right I'm going to run
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
for office which of these do I do and do
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
I need a Treasurer or I need a Fiscal
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
Agent or do you need both and can they
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
be the same person
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
we are a very simple thing that treats
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
candidates and candidates who choose to
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
work through a committee identically
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
would make it easier for folks that are
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
filing to understand it would make it
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
easier for folks who want to see where
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
the money is coming from and going to to
 
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
be able to keep track of that
 
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.549 align:start position:0%
be able to keep track of that
um

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
we then have these segregated fund
 
00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:30.830 align:start position:0%
we then have these segregated fund
organizations

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
we are reading into the statute I think
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
logically and reasonably that to be a
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
segregated fund political committee you
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to be part of an entity that exists
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
in some legal form other than being a
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
political committee and you've got to
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
have a fund that the political spending
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
fund is segregated from
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
so this would not be something that just
 
00:28:54.409 --> 00:28:54.419 align:start position:0%
folks getting together to be a political
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee would be able to do if their
 
00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
only existence was as a registered
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
political committee they need to be
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
something else and I again I'll leave
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
the details for either your questions or
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
or you can read what I've tried to give
 
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
you what would be most helpful
 
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.010 align:start position:0%
you what would be most helpful
um

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
I think the major purpose electioneering
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
and the major purpose not electioneering
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
are areas that one create these
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
differentials of when you become a
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
committee that are confusing and hard
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
for folks to sort out and becomes
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
enticing for someone that doesn't
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
understand the structure to pick the one
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
that gives them the most Liberty I.E
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'll report I'll make myself the one
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to report till I hit
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
the higher amount of funds
 
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.610 align:start position:0%
the higher amount of funds
um

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organizations are a
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
really difficult thing to kind of
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
understand who they were intended to be
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances they exist I've
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
mentioned the issue of whether funds
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
received for and used to make
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
contributions to candidates are even
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
reportable under the system by the
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization they
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that they are under the
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
statute which probably translates to
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
that they are not
 
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.669 align:start position:0%
that they are not
um

00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
so I provided that on page five item two
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
an explanation as best I can what I
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
typically tell folks when I end up on
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
the phone or talking with them about
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
should I form a committee or just file
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
as a candidate what I understand those
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines starting on page six
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
item three and going forward I've tried
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
to lay out the reporting deadlines as we
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
understand them with columns for the
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
candidate which ones apply in columns
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
for a candidate committee which also
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
would apply to any other form of
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
political Committee in terms of when
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
folks need to
 
00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:45.289 align:start position:0%
folks need to
um

00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
submit their first report
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page seven you'll see
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's some highlighted sections this
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
is probably one of the lighter lifts
 
00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:54.779 align:start position:0%
that if you chose to you could clean up
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines are sometimes
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
defined as you report funds received and
 
00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:02.870 align:start position:0%
defined as you report funds received and
expended

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
expended
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
up until the Monday preceding the filing
 
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:08.340 align:start position:0%
and in other places for other events the
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
same committee or the same candidate but
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
later for a different filing period it's
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
up to and including the Monday before
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
the statement is due not a huge problem
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people just report the Monday
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
receipts and it's there but it creates
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
this if they ask me a question and I
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
need to give them a precise answer well
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
which are you and at which filing
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
deadline are you at to know whether you
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
stop what you got on Sunday is the last
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
thing you have to report to later or the
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
last thing you received on Monday is
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
there are some duplicative reporting in
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
the statute some of it may be purposeful
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm not suggesting the answer of
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
whether it should be removed or not but
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
you should as you consider this be
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
mindful we have this system that
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
requires the reporting of independent
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures the threshold is a thousand
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
dollars in the Aggregate and then
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a 48-hour deadline after the
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
expenditure to file that report those
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
independent expenditure reports do not
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
satisfy as we understand the law the
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
periodic reporting requirements
 
00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:24.299 align:start position:0%
so you would file a 48-hour independent
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
expenditure report you would also have
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
to include that same expenditure in your
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
report for the period in which the
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
expenditure was made that you might be
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
filing at a subsequent Moment In Time
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
maybe a good reason for it if not then
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'd encourage you to think about the
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
pros and cons the benefits versus cost
 
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
the basic structure of the campaign
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
Finance law as we understand it is once
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
you trigger a duty to report you're
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
reporting your receipts and your
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
expenditures and you have to keep
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
reporting until you hit zero
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
so you can go beyond the end of the
 
00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:03.419 align:start position:0%
election if you have a debt you can go
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
out and fundraise and raise more money
 
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
to pay off that debt but you have to
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
file every six months until your
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
accountant hits zero
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
for many but not all of the folks who
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
file they are
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
multi-election cycle participants in the
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
process and to the extent that they have
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
a surplus we encourage them to but the
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
law doesn't require that they close out
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
I'll use as an example their 2022
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
registration their accountant when they
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
open their 2024 and they bring their
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
their Surplus down to Zero by simply
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
rolling that money forward we understand
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
the law to permit that it's important as
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
you think through this though to
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
understand that if I'm a Max donor and I
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
give to somebody I have a limitation
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
given that my characteristic as a donor
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
in the 2022 cycle
 
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.009 align:start position:0%
in the 2022 cycle
um

00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
I hit go back to zero for the 2024 cycle
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that some of the money
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
the person might roll or the committee
 
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
might roll forward from 22 to 24 might
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
include funds that came from me
 
00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:09.899 align:start position:0%
um in the past our understanding of the
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's approach to this is
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's not violating an a contribution
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
limit unless there's no circumstance
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
except that it is an excessive
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
contribution and most of these entities
 
00:34:24.169 --> 00:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
have contributions to many people
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
There's no practical way to or
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
requirement to account which dollar is
 
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
spent where so once it's fungible in a
 
00:34:33.649 --> 00:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
pool of larger amounts have given the
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
full 30 000 that I could give or fifteen
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
thousand depending on my characteristics
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
but who I gave it to had fifty thousand
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
and they spent 35 of it the presumption
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
is going to be that my 15 was part of
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
the 35 they spent not part of the 15
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
that rolls into the next year but we are
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
mindful as we look at the law and try to
 
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
provide guidance on it it's our
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
understanding the Attorney General's
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
office is mindful to be cautious that
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
there aren't systematic things permitted
 
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
that would allow somebody to go above
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
the contribution limit but not be
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
accountable for it one of the areas and
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
it's addressed in the memo is the issue
 
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.810 align:start position:0%
it's addressed in the memo is the issue
of

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:13.820 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
fundraising after an election to
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
increase Surplus
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
so we see some of this we think it's not
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
proper but it clear is not clearly
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
prohibited in the statute
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
and one of the concerns with fundraising
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
after the election if you have a surplus
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
as of the election or paying off the
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
debts that you may have accrued by the
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
election is that it's a way to go to
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
your maxed owners or people who might be
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
Max donors in the next cycle get them to
 
00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
contribute to the 2022 cycle really just
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
adding to the Surplus knowing that
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to roll that forward but in
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
a way that doesn't attribute to the
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
specific contributor
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
and then that contributor resets to zero
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
and can again contribute to Max in the
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
2024 cycle so kind of a fine nuance and
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have evidence that
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
there's any kind of serious or rampant
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
efforts to contribute beyond the
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
limitations so maybe a solution in
 
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
search for a problem that's your
 
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
judgment call to make but I've alerted
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
you to that nuance and that if it's your
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
intent that election day when I look at
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
all my receipts and my expenditures and
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
the death that I hold at that moment if
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
I have a surplus I probably shouldn't be
 
00:36:29.569 --> 00:36:29.579 align:start position:0%
doing a fundraising after election day
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
that is just going to build my Surplus
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
more it makes the process of keeping
 
00:36:35.569 --> 00:36:35.579 align:start position:0%
track of whether somebody contributed
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
more than they're permitted to at least
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
very difficult if not impossible and
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
certainly at the enforcement level
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
couple of um
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
well political advocacy organizations
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
whatever attention you're willing to
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
give to them if you choose to retain
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
them in the system anything to help us
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
all understand what they are would be
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciated
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh just a couple more items I'm almost
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
done here item nine
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
there is a provision in 664 Cullen 4
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 subsection 5 that says you can't
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
make a contribution if made without the
 
00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:12.660 align:start position:0%
knowledge and written consent of the
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
candidate or his Fiscal Agent a
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
political committee or its Treasurer and
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
not to any one of the same
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know of anybody who has made a
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
contribution that goes and asks for a
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
written permission slip before they do
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
it I'm not familiar with any campaigns
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
that have a systematic process of
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
alerting people that if you'd like to
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
contribute to me please get this written
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
permission from me so I think it's a
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
provisioning law that's not adhered to
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
widely I'm not sure what its function
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
and purpose is and would encourage you
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
to look carefully of whether that's an
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
area that you might bring that
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
the statute that requires candidates to
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
report and it has a phrase at the end of
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
one of the sentences that reads
 
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
accepting however the expenditures of
 
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
political Committees of the party to
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
which the candidate belongs in elections
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
other than primaries I think that could
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
benefit from some clarification of what
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
it is that the law is expecting I think
 
00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
it means in part that an in-kind
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
contribution made by the political
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
Committee of a political party so it
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
could be the Sullivan County Republican
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
or Democratic committee that is a
 
00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
political Committee of a political party
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's local and if they hold a
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
a cookout and they buy the food and have
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
some expenses with it
 
00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody else did that and the
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
candidate benefited from it it is
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
arguably at least an in-kind
 
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
contribution you have to sort out what
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
that candidates share of the cost was
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
candidate would have to report it as an
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
in-kind contribution I think this phrase
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
in the sentence means if it's the
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
political Committee of a political party
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
then it's not a contribution it doesn't
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
count towards what the candidate needs
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
to report the problem comes I think some
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
of these committees are making Direct
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
Cash contributions to candidates
 
00:39:07.619 --> 00:39:08.930 align:start position:0%
Cash contributions to candidates
and

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
either one of two things then needs to
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
be true either that's also Exempted
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
in which case the candidate brings it in
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
but either there's no accounting of it
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
or they have to keep a separate set of
 
00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:20.450 align:start position:0%
or they have to keep a separate set of
books

00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
for the exempt from reporting money they
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
bring in and spend
 
00:39:24.599 --> 00:39:26.150 align:start position:0%
bring in and spend
or

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:26.750 align:start position:0%
or
um

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's something that should be reported
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not clear that it should be in
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
the wording of that phrase in in that
 
00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:34.970 align:start position:0%
the wording of that phrase in in that
sentence

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
probably more of a problem for the
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
candidate because they're probably going
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
to book it in
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
and if they book it in you know they've
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
got to cover the expense or they're
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
never going to get to zero they've got
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
to show how it was expended
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
um again I've kind of laid it out as
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
clearly as I think I can but I'm happy
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
to answer questions at any point in the
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
process or we are the last item is just
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
a general recommendation that you look
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
at at some point in the future we think
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
the earliest probably should be the 2026
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
election cycle give us a chance to get
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
the new system acquired developed and in
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
place to some extent but requiring most
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
if not all people with a due to files to
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
file electronically
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
um anybody who spent any time looking at
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
paper filings that we post on our
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
website will know their utility is
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
dramatically less than those who file
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
electronically in part just because you
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
can't read the numbers
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
you know and the new cursive required
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
education in high school maybe we'll
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
help that out if that becomes law but as
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
a practical matter having the values the
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
numbers type makes it more realistic
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
frankly it's helpful to the filer the
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
candidate and the committee to the
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
extent that the campaign Finance system
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
the old one that's going out has some of
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
this we're trying to enhance it in the
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
new one coming in has tools that help
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
them do the math and keep track and
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
alert them that says hey you're saying
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
that bud Fitch you know previously gave
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
you five thousand for the primary you're
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
now saying is going to give you another
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
2 000. he's somebody who's subject the
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
way you've entered him into the 5000
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
limit so probably you shouldn't accept
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
that contribution so they're tools that
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
can help people who have a duty file be
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
compliant it certainly makes it easier
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
for the public or those who are
 
00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:24.619 align:start position:0%
interested other candidates perhaps in
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
who raised how much from whom to have
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
numbers that they can actually read and
 
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
finally and it's in that section 11 the
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
default starting point under the statute
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
as we understand it is everything that's
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
turned into US is completely public and
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
anybody for any reason kind of a right
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
to know law standard can come and look
 
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:50.339 align:start position:0%
at that information to the extent we get
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
it up on the website
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
they can from wherever they want to go
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
there and they can use it for any
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
purpose that they want to there's no
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
constraint on how this information is
 
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.970 align:start position:0%
constraint on how this information is
used

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
used
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
one of the things that would be helpful
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
to us is to have the ability to either
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
encourage or require followers to
 
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.890 align:start position:0%
encourage or require followers to
provide

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
a way to contact them cell phone number
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
and email address but we know that many
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
people either use the ones they don't
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
have any time to get to for email
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
addresses or they have one but they're
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
careful who gets it so it doesn't become
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
a source of spam or unwanted attention
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
so the legislature has in other areas
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
created an exemption to the right to no
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
law for phone numbers and emails
 
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
provided to the Secretary of State's
 
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
office or local election officials with
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of getting information about
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
elections so that is such that the fact
 
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
that you email us or call us as a
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
citizen asking us questions
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
would be of interest to somebody running
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
a campaign because that flags that
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
person as somebody who probably is going
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
to go vote and is interested enough to
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
be making inquiries today before that
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
law was passed somebody could have done
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
a right to no law requested us and we
 
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
would have been obligated to go find all
 
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
those emails or cell phone numbers or
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
phone numbers and give them out
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
we requested the legislature made the
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
law in that instance one that Exempted
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
it consider whether if we
 
00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:18.020 align:start position:0%
add to the information presented to us
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
give us your cell phone number we can
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
reach you or your email address whether
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
we can exempt it it is more realistic
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
for electronic filing because we simply
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
build the system to not have it report
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
that field on the things the public and
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
others can look at on paper
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually please don't make it exempt
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
because we then would have to pay human
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
beings to go and create a redaction on
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
the PDF scan of the filing in order for
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
it to not be disclosed unless it was
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
disclosed in some separate way
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
thanks bud
 
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
um let me just give you a real-time
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh example of the confusion that is out
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
there that I've been Fielding calls on
 
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
this topic uh this week and it's more
 
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
than just a couple
 
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.010 align:start position:0%
than just a couple
um

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
tomorrow six month reports are due
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
and a six-month report is a report that
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
is required to be filed
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
every six months by a candidate or a
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
political committee
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
that has not renewed its committee
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
after the past election
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
so if there is a surplus or a negative
 
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
balance in a campaign account
 
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
the candidate or the committee is
 
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:45.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for filing six months
 
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
six-month reports until a zero balance
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
is reached at which point a final report
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
is filed and there's no further
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:04.940 align:start position:0%
candidate creates a candidate committee
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
or a political committee is created for
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
the 2024 cycle
 
00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.690 align:start position:0%
the 2024 cycle
then

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
a a balance that is left over from the
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
last election
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
can be transferred to the new committee
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the past election
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
and there's no further obligation to
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
new committees that are created are
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
required to file their first report in
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
June of this year
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
and so there is a lot of confusion about
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know what do you have to file when
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
do you have to file it how do you
 
00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
transfer the funds
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
to achieve that zero balance
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we can just
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
consolidate those filing dates and make
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
the transfer of balances to a new
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
committee when it is renewed automatic
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
it would eliminate a lot of confusion
 
00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:18.140 align:start position:0%
and headaches and and unintentional
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
violations of the statute because the
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
proper report didn't get filed
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
I know that and I don't see the Attorney
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
General's office represented here but I
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
would definitely suggest that you have
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
them come in and offer their suggestions
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones that are
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for the enforcement of the
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
election law statutes including campaign
 
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.770 align:start position:0%
election law statutes including campaign
Finance

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
and they just sent a round of letters
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
out within the last month
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
for reports that were not filed or
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
properly filed from the 2020 election
 
00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:56.030 align:start position:0%
properly filed from the 2020 election
cycle

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
and you know we're getting the calls
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
from that saying you know we don't have
 
00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
those records anymore you know what do
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
we do we don't want to you know we don't
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
want to be in trouble and so you know I
 
00:47:08.809 --> 00:47:08.819 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:47:08.819 --> 00:47:09.470 align:start position:0%
I think that
um

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
you know a more timely action when it's
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
required is is better but I think we can
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate a lot of the confusion and the
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
need for the Attorney General's actions
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
if we just simplify these statutes make
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
it easier for compliance
 
00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.550 align:start position:0%
it easier for compliance
um

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's your goal as well
 
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:33.349 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's your goal as well
so

00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you well I was one of those who
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
called Matt yesterday
 
00:47:40.849 --> 00:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
for exactly this reason because I have a
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
surplus and most of it's from my own
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
because it's also not clear if when I
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
sell fund if I'm supposed to put that in
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
that's another area of confusion is do
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
we want to or
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
transparency do we want to require
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
people who self-fund to at least show
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
that and the amount not to put a limit
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
on it but it's in different parts of the
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
statute but I guess my question was when
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
I went into the system there was no
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
clear place for me to put that overage
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
in and I put in an amount and then all
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
of a sudden it bumped it up another I
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
met five hundred dollars
 
00:48:19.859 --> 00:48:20.510 align:start position:0%
met five hundred dollars
um

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
so I just filed it and said I hope this
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
is the right way to do it because I was
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
so confused so I agree with you that we
 
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
fix that but I would also like any
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts and I saw
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know Mr Fitch reaching for the thing
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
about self-financing and do we should
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
push it back in my direction
 
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.569 align:start position:0%
push it back in my direction
[Laughter]

00:48:43.569 --> 00:48:43.579 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
if I may so just a couple things to keep
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
in mind first the case law suggests that
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
the acceptable reason for regulating
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
what is otherwise First Amendment Free
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
Speech political advertising to the
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
whole Foundation of campaign Finance law
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
is one of anti-corruption and disclosure
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the courts have very clearly said I
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
can't corrupt myself
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
so you have a limited ability under the
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution to regulate how much of my
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
money I spend for myself There's No
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
Limit I can spend as much of my own
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
money as I want to as a candidate I'm
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
seeking election and I would seek
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
guidance from the Attorney General's
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
office and tread carefully on on kind of
 
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
how much you regulate that the current
 
00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
system certainly requires that if you
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
report it you've got to then keep
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with it being there until such
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
time as you expend it all so you reach
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
that magic zero amount to transfer
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
complexities are these systems Drive
 
00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:45.180 align:start position:0%
many candidates to loan their campaign
 
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.309 align:start position:0%
many candidates to loan their campaign
money

00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
so they're taking money out of their
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
pocket they're putting it in they hope
 
00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
they get more popular with contributors
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
and at some point they could repay that
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
debt back to themselves and other people
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
really underwrite the cost of the
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
campaign so it's fairly common to see in
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
reports that a candidate has loaned
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
himself or herself money
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
so then when they're in the circumstance
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
you describe them I'm at the end of that
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
and you know you're going to run again
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
you probably want to roll it over and
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
move it forward but if you're not
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
you can't normally just pay yourself the
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
Surplus but you could if you had booked
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
it as a loan to your campaign you also
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
can forgive the loan at some point to
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
get it off the books if yep I spent it
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
it was my money but I'm done and I'm
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
just going to forgive the loan which
 
00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:31.740 align:start position:0%
post-hoc converts it to being a
 
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.349 align:start position:0%
post-hoc converts it to being a
self-contribution

00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
self-contribution
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
so there are a host of complexities
 
00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:38.700 align:start position:0%
under the current statute that address
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
those concerns we are working we're
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
literally still hammering out the terms
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
of the contract we were working to make
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
the new campaign Finance system be have
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
enhanced help
 
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
and to be easier to deal with those
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
kinds of transitions that happen I just
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
note secretary scalin talked about the
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
complexity of the transition period
 
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:04.740 align:start position:0%
one thing that can happen to the law
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
does happen is I can have a 2022
 
00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:09.180 align:start position:0%
committee that has debt
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
that doesn't prevent me there's nothing
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
in the law that prevents me from opening
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
a 2024 committee and depending upon who
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
I owe that debt to if it's a friendly
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
person who loaned it to me who's not
 
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
after me to pay it off there may be
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
reasons that I want to raise new money
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
for 2024 without paying off the debt
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
from 2022 so everything Dave said layer
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
on top of that that you are
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
simultaneously reporting for your 2022
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
that has debt well you're now having to
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
report for your 2024 that's coming in
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
and you've got to keep track with your
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
donors when you get money from them
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
which that's for and you know the law is
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
pretty flexible if you have a cookout
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
and there's a basket and some of your
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
contributions just come with people who
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
are dropping checks into it or dropping
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
cash into it which is common in my
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
experience what happens pretty much the
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
law leaves it up to somebody to
 
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:03.890 align:start position:0%
law leaves it up to somebody to
determine

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
how that money was contributed was it
 
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
for an exploratory phase was it for
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
primary phase was it for the general
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
phase and if you are somebody that has
 
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:15.780 align:start position:0%
both a last cycle debt committee open
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
and a new cycle fundraising committee
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
open presumably unless they write on the
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
check you know bud Fitch for dog catcher
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
2024 which would signal that the donors
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
intent is to constrain it to that you as
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
a candidate or whoever is doing that for
 
00:52:32.109 --> 00:52:32.119 align:start position:0%
the committee could sort that through
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll just quickly throw in another
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
area you can think about is
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
the federal law for campaign Finance has
 
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
a pretty structured process for when you
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
get money that you need to give back
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
the state law is completely silent on it
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think the benefit of a system like the
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
federal system that gives you a window
 
00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
of opportunity in which you can do that
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no harm no foul recognizes
 
00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
the reality that as in the scenario I
 
00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:02.099 align:start position:0%
just described your you or whoever
 
00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
manages your funds is going through the
 
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
basket you know maybe a day or two after
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
the picnic before you realize that
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody gave you a check that is maxed
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
out and so you need to give it back to
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
them but you want to get it booked and
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
you have some duty to report it if
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
there's an imminent deadline coming up
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
but you also want to get booked into
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
that system how you give it back
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
adopting some Provisions that describe
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
what is the permissible period of time
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
in which you have in which to refund a
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
contribution that's not permissible
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
would make things easier to understand
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
and clear and set a boundary for okay
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's been more than 60 days you've had
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
time to get it back or 90 days or
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you might choose I think the
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
federal was at one time at least 60 days
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you I also want to uh
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
say that 40 of the five reps here had a
 
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.970 align:start position:0%
say that 40 of the five reps here had a
problem

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
similar to representative Lane because I
 
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
made a similar the details were a little
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
different but I made a similar call
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday and
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
the best I can say is I made a good a
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
good faith effort to comply
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
but I'm still don't understand the
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
any questions from our committee
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
subcommittee oh yeah I
 
00:54:21.059 --> 00:54:22.309 align:start position:0%
subcommittee oh yeah I
I'll

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
okay representative Muirhead how many
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
years did you devote to studying physics
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
I don't even want to say it was a long
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
certainly so if this is difficult for
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
you to understand how to comply them and
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
can presume that people
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
is difficult for everybody I I think
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
representative Lane uh
 
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.049 align:start position:0%
representative Lane uh
um

00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
you talked about streamlining these
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
different kinds of committees
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:05.700 align:start position:0%
how do we do I'm a little concerned
 
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
about how we would do that because the
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
Committees are often created for very
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
different purposes we have packs super
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
Pacs we have people who are end up doing
 
00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:19.339 align:start position:0%
independent expenditures
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how to streamline them
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
because I want to make sure because we
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
are after transparency and disclosure so
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
do we just say everybody discloses no
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to that is yes when I
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
first started working in the Secretary
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
of State's office and it's more than 20
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
years ago now that the definition of
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
political committee was pretty simple it
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
was two or more persons organized
 
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of supporting or
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
opposing you know a candidate or measure
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
on the ballot and and ever since then
 
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980 align:start position:0%
there's just been all of these
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
additional uh
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
Provisions placed in there and you know
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
that a committee that is going to be
 
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:15.309 align:start position:0%
that a committee that is going to be
engaged

00:56:15.309 --> 00:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
engaged
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the campaign process
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
one way or the other
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
could be just a single filing
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
just just you know it's it's a committee
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
that is engaged in political activity
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
during campaign season
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
and then there may be different types of
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
um independent expenditures or
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
whatever there may have to be a separate
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh entity for political advocacy
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
because because of federal laws and
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
court cases uh you know if they're if if
 
00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
an organization is a
 
00:56:54.059 --> 00:56:55.390 align:start position:0%
an organization is a
uh

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
551c4 five or six whatever I mean they
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to list their contributors
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
but they should still list the amount of
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
money that that they have raised
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
without those identifiers if they choose
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
it just seems to me that that it's you
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
know that the transparent
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
part of this should be
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
the money that was raised and the money
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was spent
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
and categorizing those funds so they you
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
know they're appropriately uh
 
00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:33.470 align:start position:0%
know they're appropriately uh
divulged

00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
divulged
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
and then having reporting deadlines that
 
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.370 align:start position:0%
and then having reporting deadlines that
are

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
uniform and simple and I think if we can
 
00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:42.589 align:start position:0%
uniform and simple and I think if we can
streamline

00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
streamline
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
that as much as possible it will benefit
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
everyone and there are different
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
thresholds as Bud mentioned in the
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
statute for you know when that
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
particular entity currently kicks in
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
as a as a political committee I mean
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
just make it just make a one just you
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
know have a have a single threshold
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me and uh
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know have you know allow for
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
generous contributions maybe eliminate
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
the different phases of exploratory
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
primary General and just you know allow
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
a single contributor to give x amount of
 
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.510 align:start position:0%
a single contributor to give x amount of
dollars

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
per election you know to a candidate
 
00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:26.690 align:start position:0%
per election you know to a candidate
um

00:58:26.690 --> 00:58:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I think if we can do that it will be
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
just simpler for everybody to understand
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
the process and the transparency that
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to see would certainly
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
if I can just add in
 
00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:41.210 align:start position:0%
if I can just add in
um

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
there's a statue that says committees
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
have to report when they pass the
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
threshold there's a statute that says
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
candidates have to report when they pass
 
00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
the threshold both are defined terms the
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
law talks about exploratory committees
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
there's no statute that says an
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
exploratory candidate has any duty to
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
file a receipts and expenditure report
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
even though there are constraints on how
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
much they can take in and
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
part of the struggle is that we live in
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
a world where a lot of the people active
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
are also active federally and federally
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
a Super PAC is a defined entity in their
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire I try to push the
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
word political committee it's not even a
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
political action committee because
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's not how you've defined it in the
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
law to try to help people think that
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay if I'm talking state I'm not
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
talking Super PAC or pack or 524 or any
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
of the multiple ways people have figured
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
out how to move money federally I'm just
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
talking about a plain a political
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
committee now I may be talking about a
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization we've
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
made it more complex than it was when I
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
first started working in it but it's
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
there and I think that's part of the
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
reality really active people who are
 
00:59:51.049 --> 00:59:51.059 align:start position:0%
well intentioned have got it into their
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
mind that there are things that exist
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
because they exist in the federal side
 
00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
that exist on the state side when in
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
fact they don't
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and that's part of the challenge of
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
um I I spent the weekend rereading ours
 
01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
and trying to come up with a list and uh
 
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
and we spent the last meeting doing the
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
same thing but yours is much much better
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much
 
01:00:22.079 --> 01:00:22.910 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much
um

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
I guess part of me says why do we need a
 
01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
threshold is that something that we see
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
across other states is that
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
why is there a threshold do we need it
 
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh if if I can I believe the threshold
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
exists because there's frankly an amount
 
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
of money changing hands to promote
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
somebody's candidacy or to oppose it
 
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't matter if we're
 
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
concerned about undue influence and
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about knowing who our
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
elected officials are influenced by
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
um if I may use a State Rep who runs a
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
600 campaign as an example is it really
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
public interest or concern about that
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
other than maybe the person running
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
against her or him in the campaign but
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
as a general proposition
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
people volunteering to take a hundred
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
dollar a year job that takes tons and
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
tons of hours probably isn't going to be
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
unduly influenced by less than 600 or
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
less than a thousand dollars of money
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
coming and going so my understanding of
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent and having
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
thresholds is in part that there are
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
levels below which the public policy
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
purpose for having the disclosure
 
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
aren't satisfied because there's just
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
not public interest the
 
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
goal of having disclosure so that if
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's unduly influenced by a
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
particular contributor or set of
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
contributors with a particular point of
 
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
view this isn't going to happen below a
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ross thank you
 
01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.089 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ross thank you
um

01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
I have a couple uh
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
just while we've got you
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
um how long does it take your office to
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
turn around paper filings or filings
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
whenever they're filing deadlines due
 
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.140 align:start position:0%
and we receive the filings it I think
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
that information gets scanned in pretty
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
much the same day if not it's just a
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
couple of days we get it up fairly
 
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.569 align:start position:0%
couple of days we get it up fairly
quickly

01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:02:32.579 --> 01:02:40.329 align:start position:0%
quickly
foreign

01:02:40.329 --> 01:02:40.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
I have a question What proportion of the
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
filings are by paper instead of online
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have to get a
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
get that information to you what what I
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
think that uh we are going to reach a
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
point where it will be important for the
 
01:03:04.010 --> 01:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
that electronic filings are mandatory uh
 
01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
what happens now is that even with some
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
of the major candidates and I'm talking
 
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
believe that there is some benefit to
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
not making their donor list easily
 
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.510 align:start position:0%
not making their donor list easily
acceptable

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:26.579 align:start position:0%
and so some of them still file their
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
reports on paper
 
01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
and not only that in between filings we
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
see font changes we see spreadsheet
 
01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:38.180 align:start position:0%
columns change
 
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:41.540 align:start position:0%
things that make even the paper filings
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
difficult to follow
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
um and so you know part of the
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
part of the process of being transparent
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh and disclosure allows
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
the general public to easily View and
 
01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.870 align:start position:0%
the general public to easily View and
search

01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
search
 
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
for items that they're looking for and
 
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
so as long as the major candidates are
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
not all uniformly providing the
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
information into the electronic database
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
you get some information but you're not
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
you're not able to see the whole picture
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
but again that's a that's a legislative
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
decision to finally
 
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know go all the way and make it
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
mandatory as opposed to giving the
 
01:04:25.079 --> 01:04:26.030 align:start position:0%
mandatory as opposed to giving the
option

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you so what I'm hearing here
 
01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
is that some submissions
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not saying it's
 
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
deliberate but is it's almost as if it
 
01:04:37.849 --> 01:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
were an attempt to make it more
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
difficult for people to
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
to receive the information that they're
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
supposed to be provided it says it's
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
yes representative representative just
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
to resp just to return to the ques the
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
question of the difference between the
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
federal category safer committees and
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
the state categories would it would one
 
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
of the would it be a correct takeaway to
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
say that it'd be an advantage if
 
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.470 align:start position:0%
say that it'd be an advantage if
um

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance law and the state used
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
the same categories as exist in federal
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
I would be cautious with that approach
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
just because
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
while it's on its face or at the top
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
level surface the federal system is
 
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
somewhat simpler than ours once you dig
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
in a little bit it is not at all and so
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
because of the use of the 501c4 through
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
whatever categories because of the
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
different IRS provisions and its 524s
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
are one that was popular at one point I
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if they used as much in this
 
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
day and age there are a bunch of ways to
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
do the things that our political
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
committees do under the federal system
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
that bring them outside of kind of the
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
usual rules and then they do recognize
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
both political action committees and
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
super political action committees
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that that's simpler
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
what I do know having spent a little
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
time in my lifetime in in that area
 
01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:10.430 align:start position:0%
time in my lifetime in in that area
um

01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot more money being
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
involved in most of the campaigns of any
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
significance have staff attorneys staff
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
accountants who only do campaign Finance
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
work under the federal law I mean it's a
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
very complicated thing and certainly we
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
have some high-level office where
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
there's likely enough money to fund that
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
sort of thing but we also have State Rep
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
and County attorney and sure phrases
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
that are subject to the same set of laws
 
01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
that are subject to the same set of laws
where

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
Sheriff shouldn't have to hire an
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
attorney or a CPA to report her or his
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
yes I want to go back to the mandatory
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
online filing because as I've said
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
before this is something that I'm
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
actually a supporter of for a variety of
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
reasons is there a reason why you make
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
your recommendation on your last page of
 
01:06:59.039 --> 01:07:00.589 align:start position:0%
your recommendation on your last page of
2026

01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
2026
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
is is there I I publicated I would love
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
it if we eat it in the next election so
 
01:07:07.849 --> 01:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
kind of like what's the why are we why
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
are we why is your office's
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation three years out and not
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:15.020 align:start position:0%
we're currently operating the old system
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
we're in the Contracting phase
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
negotiating a contract for the new
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
system and well our goal is to have it
 
01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
available when the serious
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
entries happen for 2024 I've never been
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
involved in rolling out a online
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
complicated database and Reporting
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
System that didn't have lots of problems
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
and glitches that you have to work
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
through making it mandatory at a point
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
when you know that you're probably it's
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
not going to be 100 smooth we're going
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
to do the best we can we have High Hopes
 
01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
um that making it mandatory at a point
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
when we can reasonably expect it to be
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
settled down and most of the problems
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
haven't been found and addressed I think
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
drove our 2026 recommendation
 
01:07:54.780 --> 01:08:01.089 align:start position:0%
drove our 2026 recommendation
foreign

01:08:01.089 --> 01:08:01.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
um I want to go over to
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
the exploratory candidates
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's another issue that I've raised is I
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
I just don't believe that's a that
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
should be a real thing unless you're
 
01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:15.299 align:start position:0%
actively actually exploring it I think
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
there was a union leader article this
 
01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
last week about they called it a
 
01:08:20.699 --> 01:08:21.950 align:start position:0%
last week about they called it a
loophole

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:24.299 align:start position:0%
so it can you kind of dig into that a
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean I know it's somebody
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
they haven't made themselves into a
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
candidate yet because they haven't said
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
I am running
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
but they're actively raising funds in
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
this case we have a candidate who's
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
exploring who's raised a hundred
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
um a person I would make the statement
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
that you're not exploring at that point
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
if you've got six figures in your bank
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
account but
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
um can you kind of elaborate on like
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
what would be I would love to close that
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
up just for the record I would just love
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
to close that up would maybe this is a
 
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
question more for the secretary but if
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
we were to Define exploratory
 
01:08:59.809 --> 01:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
would your office be amenable to if we
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
made it something like you can't raise
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
or spend more than five thousand after
 
01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
that you're not exploring
 
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
if I'll start answering and then
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
secretary may have something more to add
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
to it so as I have experienced the
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
history and I don't represent myself to
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
know every element of it this is
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
something that evolved slowly over time
 
01:09:20.329 --> 01:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
and there were people going back many
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
cycles who weren't sure what they wanted
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
to run or not and they wanted to do some
 
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
polling they wanted to test polling this
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
is higher level State offices test some
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the ideas that they wanted to advance
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
and to see how well received they would
 
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
be before they made the decision to
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
actually become a candidate so that's my
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of how it evolved and then
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
it became exactly I think what you've
 
01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
described and not a third bite at the
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
Apple an opportunity earlier in the
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
process to get your major supporters
 
01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
folks that are willing to give you as
 
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
much as the law lets you get from them
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
to make some early contributions and
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
even though it might not yet be time to
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
start running ads which I think that
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
date has moved further and further back
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
in time from the actual election over
 
01:10:06.189 --> 01:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
the last couple decades
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
that you could pay somebody your team
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to develop your ads there's
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
work to be done that you needed money to
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
pay for that evolved there so one
 
01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
Point second point when does somebody
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
become a candidate so we have a statute
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
that defines a candidate and says you
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
become a candidate when you declare
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
yourself as one we have an attorney
 
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
general's office opinion or statement of
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
its application of the law that as far
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
as I know is still being applied it
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
dates back I think it was Phil
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
McLaughlin those who remember back that
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
far was the Attorney General where it
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
came out who said this is too
 
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.770 align:start position:0%
came out who said this is too
complicated

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
so if I'm making a speech and I say I'm
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
thinking about running for dog catcher
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
am I a candidate I plan to run for dog
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
catcher my candidate I'm going to file
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
and seek election as dog catcher I'm a
 
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.030 align:start position:0%
and seek election as dog catcher I'm a
candidate

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
somebody can't be expected to have a
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia lawyer beside them and
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
coaching them as they make public
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
statements whether it's in a speech or
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
to a reporter or however and have that
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
be the determinant of that they became a
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
candidate and from an enforcement
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
perspective you know isn't realistic
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
that you're going to send out
 
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
investigators to question or try to find
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
audio video tapes of the statements the
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
candidate made and then parse it to see
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
so the Attorney General's office said
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
four campaign Finance purposes you're
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
going to become a candidate when you
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
file for office in June
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
and until you do
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're not going to treat that as that
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that also promoted the
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
recognition of okay but I've got to
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
raise money and do things before then in
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
the current environment while you're an
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
exploratory candidate until you do that
 
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
until you make that formal declaration
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
with the Secretary of State's office to
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
officially become a candidate federally
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
I think there is I've looked at this for
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
a while so check it at one time there
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
was a dollar amount if you raise or
 
01:11:59.090 --> 01:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
spend more than x dollars you're a
 
01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
candidate without consideration to
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
whether you've made the decision to
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
formally declare or not so I think there
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
are other approaches to setting that
 
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
boundary but frankly the simplest one is
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
the one the secretary has suggested
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
let's eliminate exploratory primary
 
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
General you can raise money you have to
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
report who you got it from and then the
 
01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:19.620 align:start position:0%
public and your opponents and the press
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
and everybody that's interested in that
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
can look at how much that is and if they
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
think you're taking too much from a
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
particular Source or a particular
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
interest group or whatever that becomes
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
part of the political debate secretary
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and just and just more broadly the
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
interest of our office is
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
that we have a lot
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
that is easy to administer
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
and so you know our concern is
 
01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.470 align:start position:0%
and so you know our concern is
transparency

01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.169 align:start position:0%
transparency
simplicity

01:12:47.169 --> 01:12:47.179 align:start position:0%
simplicity
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to explain how the law works
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
and and to train the users you know
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
issues related to
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know when a person should become a
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
candidate you know when can they really
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
start raising funds you know I think
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
those are policy decisions
 
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.390 align:start position:0%
those are policy decisions
uh

01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
to be made by the legislature that are
 
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.350 align:start position:0%
to be made by the legislature that are
Beyond

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
I think our role in the process and so
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
um we just want to be able to administer
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
it be able to explain it and be able to
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
enforce it
 
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.330 align:start position:0%
enforce it
um

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
and then you guys get to decide that you
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you um welcome just to restate
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
that it seems maybe possible for the
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of campaign Finance if we don't
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
have people declare a register as
 
01:13:46.970 --> 01:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
candidates or candidate committees at
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
all we just say any person or group that
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
that raises or spends X dollars
 
01:13:57.290 --> 01:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
for the sake of exploring or advancing a
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
candidate or a measure must report that
 
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
to the Secretary of State's office and
 
01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
then for campaign Finance all these
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
distinctions just go away it's only our
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
people are groups raising or spending X
 
01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.189 align:start position:0%
people are groups raising or spending X
dollars

01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.370 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean there is you know that there
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
is a line somewhere uh when you have an
 
01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.450 align:start position:0%
is a line somewhere uh when you have an
individual

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
that is going to spend a lot of their
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
own money on multiple candidates
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
and you know it
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
what point does that person remain an
 
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:39.620 align:start position:0%
individual just simply giving
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
contributions or is there a point where
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
that person becomes
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know a committee that's trying to
 
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
influence the outcome of election I you
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
know that that's that's an area for for
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
you to talk about but you know as I
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned before it's just you know if
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
we can just have a simple set of
 
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.390 align:start position:0%
we can just have a simple set of
uh

01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
statutes that Define
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
the reporting process
 
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
the reporting process
um

01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
I have a question gentlemen
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh at what point do attempts to regulate
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
speech which is what political
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
campaigning is do you have a feel for
 
01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
when that comes up against the right to
 
01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
free speech guarantee by the First
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment we just
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
heard of a thought of someone
 
01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
raising money to get a message out on
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
political matters but that seems to be
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
the heart of what's protected by the
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
First Amendment so
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
how do we sort out where that hard limit
 
01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
because if you're going to put in
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
statute there has to be a hard limit at
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
some point that's defined how do we sort
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
that out
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's a general question but do you have
 
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
some thoughts
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
certainly the courts seem to have looked
 
01:16:01.250 --> 01:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
at what is the permissible purpose for
 
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
regulating free speech and they have
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
recognized that letting the public know
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
who is funding campaigns and candidates
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
in the interest of discouraging or
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
making transparent if there's undue
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
influence is permissible I mean we treat
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
candidates and measures about the same
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
in our law I no one's ever challenged
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
that proposition but certainly there are
 
01:16:29.209 --> 01:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
other contexts where the regulation of
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
money saying vote yes or no on this
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional question is viewed
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
differently because how do you corrupt
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
a constitutional question
 
01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.910 align:start position:0%
a constitutional question
right

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
you know when you give money to a
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
candidate and maybe you have a personal
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
business interest or whatever and
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
there's a theory that for some donors
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
and for some candidates there's an
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money that if you give them
 
01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
enough that's going to influence how
 
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
they act in their public office based on
 
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
that contribution that's what the whole
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
system is designed to recognize the
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
courts have said yep the public at least
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
gets to know about it
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
um in order to
 
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
discourage and bring to light that kind
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
of undue influence not sure this
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
argument would ultimately survive on a
 
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:19.189 align:start position:0%
argument would ultimately survive on a
measure

01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
so in the uh obviously I have to go and
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
step out and do a work thing here in two
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
minutes so I apologize if we're still
 
01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
around after 20 minutes I'll be back but
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
I want to get this in before I have to
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
go into the hundred dollars a year you
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
know it just doesn't go that far
 
01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.410 align:start position:0%
know it just doesn't go that far
um

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
so we have three core organizations
 
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
in general we've got Pax parties and
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
candidates right and from that we have
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
various splits so one of the things that
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
we could do is consolidate that I think
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
consolidating parties is pretty easy I
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
think consolidating candidates is pretty
 
01:17:51.719 --> 01:17:52.970 align:start position:0%
think consolidating candidates is pretty
easy

01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
easy
 
01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:53.810 align:start position:0%
easy
um

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
Consulting packs should be easy with the
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
exception of the
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
citizens united decision so kind of
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
assuming we wanted to consolidate that
 
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
which I imagine there would actually
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
probably be some consensus on this how
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
would we consolidate political action
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
committees and still be in compliance
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
with the citizen United decision
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
so I haven't read citizens united for a
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
while my recollection of it it basically
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
says that corporations that at one time
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
were prohibited from making political
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
contributions were recognized as persons
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
and could and so if you say whoever you
 
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.250 align:start position:0%
and could and so if you say whoever you
are

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
you have to report the money you get
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
from them and we set some
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
limit maybe a single one for everything
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's fairly high it's unclear to me
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
you may understand it better than I do
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe there is some thing that
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
implicates citizens united but I don't
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
think it does if Corporation can give
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
money and you treat them like a person
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
or like a committee you know which a
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
political committees sometimes have a
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
legal existence other than being a
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
political committee but most of them are
 
01:19:04.729 --> 01:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
don't so that's their sole entity causes
 
01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:05.940 align:start position:0%
them trouble when they try to get a bank
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
account but that's a whole separate
 
01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.050 align:start position:0%
account but that's a whole separate
discussion

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't immediately I cannot
 
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
identify for you a boundary that
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
citizens united creates
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
well a follow-up that's absolutely not a
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up because it's um I'm just going
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
full add brain right now
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.550 align:start position:0%
full add brain right now
um

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh parties and candidates
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
so when a party sends out a mailer that
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
is not authorized by the candidate the
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
disclaimer has to be you know paid for
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
by so-and-so political
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
um you know State committee
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
um not authorized by any candidate or
 
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
candidates committee
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
but then there's nothing in there that
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
says the candidate couldn't authorize it
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
with their own party and then we don't
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
have to say there's nothing in the
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
provision says authorized by the
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
candidate or candidates committee is
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
there a re do we know why that's not
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's just a huge gray area right so if
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
they leave that off as it's to be
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
inferred that the candidate approved of
 
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
the mailer or you see what I'm trying to
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
get at like is that another area that's
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
confusing because it definitely
 
01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
confusing to me I'll start answering in
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary may want to add to it yes it's
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
confusing and if you can make it more
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
clear it certainly would help people
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
sort through that I think that my
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
understanding of kind of the background
 
01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
of what's going on is the basic concept
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
is that if a candidate and somebody else
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
paying for communications that benefits
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
the candidate coordinate in any way it's
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
an in-kind contribution
 
01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
and then I brought your attention to
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
earlier the reporting statute for
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
candidates has this phrase that I'm not
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
entirely sure what it's meant to do and
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
nor what a court would ultimately find
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
that it does do that says you don't have
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
to report things that are done by the
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
political Committee of a political party
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
which could be the state party but it
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
also could be one of the multitude of
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
town and County and other political
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
Committees of political parties that
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
exist there are quite a number of them
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.410 align:start position:0%
out there
um

01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
I hope that's helpful uh Sherman I'll be
 
01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
back in 20 minutes just so you know I
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
headed back to candidate versus
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
candidate committee
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know I face this we all face this
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
when we start to run and I think
 
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
particularly in reps not all reps are
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
small campaigns but most of them are
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
is there a reason that we need to
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
differentiate or
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
is there some
 
01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think that is a part of the statute
 
01:21:47.689 --> 01:21:47.699 align:start position:0%
that has just evolved over a long period
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
of time that yeah there was a period of
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
time before there were political
 
01:21:51.659 --> 01:21:53.209 align:start position:0%
time before there were political
committees

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:21:53.219 --> 01:21:54.669 align:start position:0%
committees
and

01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
Canada's just reported to the extent
 
01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
they had to report as a candidate and
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
so the candidate statute continued to
 
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
the present time even though you know
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
there was a new additional of candidate
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
committee and I think you're right that
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
there are many candidates for State Rep
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
that just run as individual candidates
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
and don't file a committee it doesn't
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
make much sense for them to do that but
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think when you get to the Senate you
 
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
know the major candidates there all have
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
candidate committees and I think that
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know the parties strongly suggest
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
that they create one and and donors
 
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.390 align:start position:0%
that they create one and and donors
frankly

01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
like to know that they're contributing
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
money to an entity as opposed
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
to just giving money to a person
 
01:22:41.699 --> 01:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
to just giving money to a person
sometimes

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to monopolize but what
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
from a if we make reporting consistent
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
for everybody you know do you make it
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
and and you can put in a threshold
 
01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.870 align:start position:0%
and and you can put in a threshold
amount

01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
they make it the first time and then do
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
you have them do it quarterly I mean
 
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
what what when you say consistently or
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
at the same time from a disclosure
 
01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint is there a Feeling
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
how often do you need to do that during
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
that that is a determination of the
 
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislature okay um
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
prior to maybe six years ago or eight
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
years ago the the reporting schedule was
 
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:42.620 align:start position:0%
directly related
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
to proximity to the election
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
and so reports were required uh one week
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
before the election three weeks before
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
the election
 
01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
and that it might have been eight weeks
 
01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
before the election I think that's still
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
but then a more recent legislature
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
decided that they also wanted to have
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
reports filed in the year before the
 
01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.450 align:start position:0%
reports filed in the year before the
election

01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh in June and December I believe so
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
that created you know a additional
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
requirements but also
 
01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:18.590 align:start position:0%
requirements but also
um

01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know at the same time they didn't
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
try and sink that in with a six-month
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
reports that are filed so you know now
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
we have a report that's due tomorrow for
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
six months reports and then there'll be
 
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:33.380 align:start position:0%
another report due a month later in June
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
when committees that have
 
01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
filed uh after make their first report
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
do we have further questions
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you on the difference between a
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
candidate committee and a candidate just
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
looking at this and now realize that the
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
candidate is triggered you know to
 
01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
encourage a responsibility to report
 
01:25:07.250 --> 01:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
when the candidate has ex has spent
 
01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
money a thousand dollars including of
 
01:25:11.209 --> 01:25:11.219 align:start position:0%
just spending their own money
 
01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
but yazooved explained it as you've
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
explained it that the courts say that um
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
candidates can't corrupt themselves so
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
in principle there's no public reason to
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
force people to show how they're
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
spending their money if it's their money
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
and and the public really has right to
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
know who candidates are getting money
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
from so one possibility would be to
 
01:25:32.450 --> 01:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
eliminate the candidate reporting of
 
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
spending their own money and say that
 
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
candidates have a you know duty to
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
report only when they receive money from
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
others whatever that threshold might be
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
could be low it could be zero
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
I I think you're right you're
 
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
identifying an option that's available
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
to you I would think about that option
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
in light of our experience in the last
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
couple decades where there are some
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
pretty major self-funded campaigns and
 
01:25:57.169 --> 01:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
do you want a circumstance where
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who's not rich is running and
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
raising money and spending it and
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
there's lots of transparency about
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
what's coming and going and their
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
opponent is somebody who's sufficiently
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
wealthy to spend millions of dollars and
 
01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:11.219 align:start position:0%
posts as well who's paying for that
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
where is that's coming from and if
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
there's nothing reported
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
you can draw an inference well they must
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
be self-funding but you know that I know
 
01:26:22.129 --> 01:26:22.139 align:start position:0%
federally there's been lots of cases and
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
challenges and I frankly don't even know
 
01:26:25.729 --> 01:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
the current state of the law it's going
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be the candidates money but does that
 
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
conclude The candidate's spouse's money
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
does it include the candidate's parents
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
money I mean you may have read the same
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
stories I have where somebody's dad gave
 
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
them some money for their campaign and
 
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
was Dad kind of them or is that a
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
separate entity who's subject to the
 
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
constraints and how much can be given so
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
I think there's a rationale to support
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
some level of reporting but I think
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
you've identified as an option that's
 
01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.149 align:start position:0%
you've identified as an option that's
available

01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I really appreciate that
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
um nothing like being an expert
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh I have one other question that's okay
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm also curious about whether you think
 
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
there's a rationale for the difference
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
between category four political
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
committee segregated organ you know
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
organization fund and
 
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
um political number six for the many
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
I do not I mean I I
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
change jobs along the way I used to do a
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
lot of this campaign Finance when I
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
worked at the AG's office I did some
 
01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
other jobs for a while I came back when
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
I went to work for the Secretary of
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
State and frankly was a little bit
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
unclear in my mind why some of these
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
categories were created and what the
 
01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
objectives were using the words that
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
were put into the law I've done my best
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
to try to understand them
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't have a good answer
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
to you thank you and there is no
 
01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:47.420 align:start position:0%
requirement in the statute that
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
candidates actually have to create a
 
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:51.050 align:start position:0%
candidates actually have to create a
separate

01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
bank account for their campaign funds
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
they can they can run it through their
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
personal finances as long as they keep
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
good records of what's going where
 
01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
certainly if we're asked the question we
 
01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
would recommend that a candidate open an
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
account where you know
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
where the funds are separate
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
um just to kind of keep them out of
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
trouble down the road
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
but then there are larger entities like
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know labor unions cannot
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
according to the statute make
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
contributions to candidate directly from
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
the union treasury they can do it if
 
01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
they create a political committee
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
and so an entity like that
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to have a segregated
 
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
fund for the political committee
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
it might be a good idea for corporations
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
which are as Bud said treated as
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
individuals to also have you know a
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
separate account for that purpose but
 
01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
separate account for that purpose but
um

01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's just the state of our
 
01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.290 align:start position:0%
that's that's just the state of our
statute

01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
been since on this but one of the things
 
01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
that I've been working on is that when
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
an LLC gives money
 
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
they're often created just to give money
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
and they can give and they're then their
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
members whether they're corporations or
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
individuals and it's a way to get around
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:29:33.890 --> 01:29:33.900 align:start position:0%
um cap so that I could give ten thousand
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars if that's the maximum and then
 
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
if Russ and I do an LLC we can each give
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
another ten thousand to the same one but
 
01:29:44.030 --> 01:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's through that entity so as an
 
01:29:47.689 --> 01:29:47.699 align:start position:0%
individual we've gone over our limit and
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
both Democrats and Republicans have used
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
this to raise a lot of money in our
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
state and in other states it's not just
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:29:58.250 --> 01:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
so my font is
 
01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:00.719 align:start position:0%
how would that fit in if we have these
 
01:30:00.719 --> 01:30:02.229 align:start position:0%
how would that fit in if we have these
various

01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
various
 
01:30:04.669 --> 01:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
disclosure pieces
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
how would that fit in I'm trying to fit
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
it into this new rubric that we are
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
working on how does that how would that
 
01:30:16.209 --> 01:30:16.219 align:start position:0%
fit in or do you know or is it am I just
 
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
speculating too much I'll try to avoid
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
any speculation
 
01:30:23.169 --> 01:30:23.179 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think the question
 
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
might be most helpful with thought
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
process maybe step back what are we
 
01:30:29.209 --> 01:30:29.219 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve we're trying to
 
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
achieve making information available to
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
the public to voters and less directly
 
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
but probably more pertinently to the
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
opposing candidate or the opposing
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
candidates party the people who are
 
01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
watching the process and trying to be
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
alert for things that they think the
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
voters should be alerted to of what's
 
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
coming and going in that respect and so
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't um
 
01:30:59.930 --> 01:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
I think the complexity of trying to sort
 
01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:02.219 align:start position:0%
out because it's llc's but if you form a
 
01:31:03.649 --> 01:31:03.659 align:start position:0%
corporation the corporation is an
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
independent person
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the corporate
 
01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:08.420 align:start position:0%
structure of even relatively simple
 
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
corporations people
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that are in the Housing
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
Industry where they're doing rental
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
properties most of them for very prudent
 
01:31:19.129 --> 01:31:19.139 align:start position:0%
civil liability reasons have each of
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
those tied up in a separate legal
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
corporate entity and if they're in a
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
position where they control the
 
01:31:27.410 --> 01:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
decisions that makes it may be an
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
insurmountable burden to try to carve
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
out some further constraint on that and
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
if there's complete transparency
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
some theories of campaign Finance
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
regulation are as long as it's
 
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
transparent let those who think it's not
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
appropriate for somebody who owns who
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
controls 10 corporations and each makes
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
individual contributions simply Drive
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
The public's attention to that
 
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if that answers your
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
just to follow up and I guess the
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
intuition is that you could create a
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
legal entity so I as a person am limited
 
01:32:05.930 --> 01:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
and how much I can give my fellow
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative for his re-election
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
campaign but if I if I then create a
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
legal entity that hides the fact that I
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
gave it money
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
or doesn't list me as a contributor and
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
that legal entity call it an LLC or just
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
new court or something gives my my my
 
01:32:25.129 --> 01:32:25.139 align:start position:0%
friend you know money that I've been
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
able to to exceed the the you know
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
contribution limits by creating this
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
thing and making my identity opaque
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
so so is you know wouldn't be enough
 
01:32:36.290 --> 01:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
just to inform the public that I made a
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
contribution up to the Limit and then
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
that I contributed to new court which
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
made another contribution because that
 
01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
would just be telling the public that
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
I've escaped the contribution limits
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I I would still have succeeded at
 
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
escaping the contribution limit so do
 
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
you think there's a a good reason to
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
somehow restrict people's ability to
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
kind of give to pass through entities
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
that then allow them to escape these
 
01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.530 align:start position:0%
that then allow them to escape these
thresholds

01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
thresholds
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
I think a challenge that you face and it
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
isn't a good answer to your question but
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
it's the best one I can offer off the
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
top of my head is that if you closed the
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
multiple Corporation process you could
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
probably somebody Desiring to do what
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
your hypothetical describes could do the
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
same thing through a political committee
 
01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:20.900 align:start position:0%
or through one of the
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
501c456 kind of entities that exist that
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
may or may not become a political
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
committee as long as there are enough
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
people willing to do it so that their
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
record of their contributions from you
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
show that this isn't just you doing it
 
01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.070 align:start position:0%
show that this isn't just you doing it
um

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're probably going to achieve that
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I would say that
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know part of this process is going
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
to involve political decisions uh policy
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
decisions that
 
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
uh you know I don't think that that's a
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
particular point that my office is
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
interested in answering I think that's
 
01:33:59.870 --> 01:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
something that the legislature has to
 
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
decide we're more concerned about
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the framework for that you know the
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
you know again the Simplicity
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and and a process that's
 
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
easy to administer
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:17.810 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that I might be asking
 
01:34:21.410 --> 01:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
questions that really aren't strictly
 
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
speaking you know germane to the work of
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
your office and therefore feel free to
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
just pass on them but I appreciate you
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
know there's a level of expertise and
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
intimacy with the details of this really
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
vexing area that just trying to extract
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
some some of that wisdom even if it's
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily and what I'm kind of
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
hearing here is that
 
01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
for really sophisticated donors Big Time
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
donors the contribution limits can be
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
escaped you can always create some sort
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
of legal thing that allows you to escape
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
them and so
 
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
um there I've heard people say we should
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
just go for transparency and not try to
 
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
cap donations because that water is
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
always going to find its way downhill
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no way to stop it and I'm
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
not saying that that's your you know
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
settled All Things Considered viewer
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State's office
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
should even have a view about that but
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
but if if there is a view I guess given
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
all the expertise all the things you've
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
seen about whether contribution limits
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately are kind of impossible to
 
01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:21.659 align:start position:0%
enforce I'd be interested to hear it
 
01:35:21.659 --> 01:35:24.350 align:start position:0%
enforce I'd be interested to hear it
yeah

01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:28.430 align:start position:0%
at some point
um

01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
you know letting the free market go if I
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
can use that term it you know is it's
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
probably a good thing but but the other
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
the other uh
 
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
kind of abstract part of this is
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
the you want to make sure the candidates
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
can compete and that they have a fair
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
shot and granted
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
speech is money but you know money can
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
can buy a lot of influence and uh
 
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's a different
 
01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's a different
issue

01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
um that is a part of this discussion
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
and you know the question is how do you
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know how do you maintain a
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
relatively Fair playing field you know
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
for the candidates that are going to
 
01:36:25.129 --> 01:36:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions at this point
 
01:36:27.719 --> 01:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions at this point
please

01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to thank you this has been
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
really helpful and
 
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I we will be taking you up on your
 
01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:37.550 align:start position:0%
um I we will be taking you up on your
offer

01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that included Mr Fish or
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
not but
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
well I've been saying that you know we
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
need to really take a look at that part
 
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
of the statute you know the whole
 
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
chapter for
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
for years and it seems like
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is a good opportunity to really
 
01:36:58.010 --> 01:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:00.350 --> 01:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for being here and I also
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
found it very helpful also having a
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
write-up because trying to
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
take adequate notes on such a
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
interesting and involved discussion is
 
01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.229 align:start position:0%
interesting and involved discussion is
impossible

01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
and I I do have the distinct impression
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
from your
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
the emphasis of the Secretary of State's
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
office is really to have a set of
 
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
statutes that are unambiguous and clear
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
and don't have conflicts and therefore
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
are not confusing
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
and you and I can see where you would
 
01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:36.260 align:start position:0%
draw a clear distinction between that
 
01:37:40.129 --> 01:37:40.139 align:start position:0%
and policy questions so thank you again
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
very much I know you're well we're all
 
01:37:43.850 --> 01:37:43.860 align:start position:0%
very busy but you guys are particularly
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
busy in your office and thank you for
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
taking the time to speak with us
 
01:37:47.699 --> 01:38:00.189 align:start position:0%
taking the time to speak with us
okay

01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
well this is I find this very useful
 
01:38:03.239 --> 01:38:04.850 align:start position:0%
well this is I find this very useful
myself

01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:06.110 align:start position:0%
myself
that's

01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:38:08.209 --> 01:38:08.219 align:start position:0%
and do you know whether the Attorney
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
General's office will be visiting this
 
01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lane has has made a
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
distinct effort
 
01:38:21.649 --> 01:38:21.659 align:start position:0%
to get in touch with them and so far
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't completed the connection
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
for reasons Beyond her control so I
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
heard from him the other day maybe I
 
01:38:31.370 --> 01:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
could maybe I maybe they'll answer my
 
01:38:33.649 --> 01:38:33.659 align:start position:0%
call now the short version of my answer
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
is uh it's been being worked on
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
and we're hopeful that we will hear from
 
01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:41.570 align:start position:0%
and we're hopeful that we will hear from
them

01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.250 --> 01:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
and I only ask that I mean again because
 
01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:44.940 align:start position:0%
the questions about what can be
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
administered by the Secretary of State's
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
office are vital but also what can be
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
enforced and that's we're asking I was
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
asking questions about what can we
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
enforce in the Secretary of State you
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
know is wisely saying that's not what we
 
01:38:57.649 --> 01:38:57.659 align:start position:0%
do right but of course it is what the AG
 
01:38:57.659 --> 01:38:59.209 align:start position:0%
do right but of course it is what the AG
does

01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:38:59.219 --> 01:39:01.129 align:start position:0%
does
yep

01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:01.139 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
so we have uh
 
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:05.580 align:start position:0%
37 minutes left in the time we have
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled for today and
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
how would uh
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
how would we as a committee like to make
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
best use of that do you want to pick up
 
01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
where we ended go ahead
 
01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
I have to confess I have a I have to be
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
back in Hanover at once I'm gonna have
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
to leave at quarter up and I don't have
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
as much time as anyone else all right
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me know
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
and his representative Ross
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
we just concluded our visit with the
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State in perfect timing Mr
 
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:36.830 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State in perfect timing Mr
Fitch

01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
Fitch
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the question is where would we like
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
to go for the next uh half hour or so
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
with this meeting
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
are you asking me I'm asking for your
 
01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
um this is a committee means a joint
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
outfit and that's I I honestly I'd like
 
01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
to hear kind of people's thoughts
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
um because this is obviously a very
 
01:40:01.610 --> 01:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance heavy side of it the
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
actual money side of it I'd like to kind
 
01:40:06.169 --> 01:40:06.179 align:start position:0%
of gather what everybody's thoughts are
 
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
or like preliminary ideas
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to start off with what my
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts are but I think I said
 
01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:13.860 align:start position:0%
something to the secretary but I kind of
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
like to know
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
find I guess find some early years of
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
consensus if you will I like that
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so I uh I wholeheartedly agree with
 
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
the overarching concept which is we
 
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
should streamline this down
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
make it consistent across the board so
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
things that I think
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see is
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know one donation one contribution
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
limit for all various organizations so
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
Pacs candidates committees parties
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
across the board whatever that number is
 
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:50.340 align:start position:0%
we can haggle over that number if it
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
wants to go up down stay the same meet
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
in the middle whatever
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I I think I could definitely get on
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
board it just being one number
 
01:41:01.729 --> 01:41:01.739 align:start position:0%
um I I can definitely get on board with
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the multitude of
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
different organizations and going down
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
to three
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
um Pax parties and candidates
 
01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.159 align:start position:0%
um and then I think one of the things we
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
should look at closing is
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
um not allowing candidates to set up
 
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
um committees specifically for one year
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think a candidate or a
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
candidates committee what everyone end
 
01:41:28.610 --> 01:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
up calling them should be tied to that
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
individual candidate and it just carries
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
until they get to their zero balance so
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
they can't do Berry 2022 Barry 2024 or
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
Barry 2026 it's just Barry for New
 
01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:39.950 align:start position:0%
Barry 2026 it's just Barry for New
Hampshire

01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
you see what I'm saying so they can't do
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
the they can't debt load they can't
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
basically use debt load as a way to get
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
around contribution issues
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah would you say that one more time
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
so one of the things you talked about
 
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
which was a very nuanced way of
 
01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
which was a very nuanced way of
um

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
it kind of Dodge I don't say dodging but
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
because it's not really dodging it's
 
01:41:59.450 --> 01:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
just not
 
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:02.100 align:start position:0%
in the spirit of the law if you will
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
um is they'll set up uh organizations
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
that live and die cycle to cycle and
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
instead of that just making it
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
as long as you are an active candidate
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
seeking office or intending to seek
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
office or actively raising money
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is your organization so it's not
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
very very 2022 it's barrier for New
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire barrier for New Hampshire
 
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
operates until Bradford New Hampshire
 
01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
hits zero
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I think another one just on the dates
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
um I would I would love to see the sixth
 
01:42:31.619 --> 01:42:32.810 align:start position:0%
um I would I would love to see the sixth
month

01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
raising money after the election I I
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
think is ridiculous
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
you know I could see a world in which
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:41.699 align:start position:0%
a week if you have you know you gotta
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
pay off whatever but I think after a
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
week you're on to the next cycle we're
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
on to the next thing so I think that's
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
an area of
 
01:42:50.930 --> 01:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
just in that and move on and you're on
 
01:42:52.669 --> 01:42:52.679 align:start position:0%
if you raise money a week after the
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
general election you are now raising
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
um I I think that would fit in with the
 
01:43:01.729 --> 01:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
idea of just having a committee that
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
continually exists until it goes to zero
 
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
well you have to have a cycle reset date
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
because if you don't because the
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
contribution limits correct you have to
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
so you have to have a cycle reset date
 
01:43:13.609 --> 01:43:13.619 align:start position:0%
so right now our cycle reset date is
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
like six months after the election which
 
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous or I think it's December
 
01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:18.890 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous or I think it's December
actually

01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.330 align:start position:0%
actually
um

01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.649 --> 01:43:24.659 align:start position:0%
yeah correct so I I would just love to
 
01:43:26.990 --> 01:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
see the cycle reset date a week after
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
the election
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
um would that interfere with somebody
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh continuing to raise money to settle
 
01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
well it it would however they're into
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
the next cycle so you could actually
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
make it they're they're paying their
 
01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
debts for the election they just
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
finished so that's really that election
 
01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
but it carries it forward and that's the
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
whole point like if the if their
 
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
organization is going to keep carrying
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
forward it actually gives them access to
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
the money faster to pay it off because
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
they can go back to so and so donor but
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
then they'd be raising money against the
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
limits for the next cycle but they have
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
debt they gotta get rid of their debts I
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean the debt stuff is not
 
01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:06.770 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean the debt stuff is not
used

01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
the way I the way I've normally seen
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
debt use is it's to what to what their
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
point is which is a candidate will come
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
in they'll front load their election
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
um and they're just paying themselves
 
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:19.860 align:start position:0%
back it's not like I irosperity don't go
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
alone Jim qualey you know twenty
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for your election or 10
 
01:44:24.530 --> 01:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
whatever it is it's it's candidate debt
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
I've I've never seen in fact I've never
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
seen a debt that wasn't candidate debt
 
01:44:31.609 --> 01:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
um because no no vendor will go on terms
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
with the candidate right or family death
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
correct family day yeah would it would
 
01:44:36.659 --> 01:44:39.169 align:start position:0%
correct family day yeah would it would
it

01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
would the recycle date in terms of
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
accepting Contra say that uh six months
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
up to six months later you're still
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
raising money to uh apply to the the
 
01:44:53.209 --> 01:44:53.219 align:start position:0%
2022 campaign not the 2024. yeah
 
01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
yeah as long as it's transparent and
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
people know that you're doing that and
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
is reported as such
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
I I I I have a philosophical problem
 
01:45:03.410 --> 01:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
with raising money for an election
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's already occurred I have a
 
01:45:07.129 --> 01:45:07.139 align:start position:0%
philosophical problem with any limits on
 
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
Free Speech whatsoever
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's where my philosophical problem
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
kicks in is immediately but I guess I
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
don't have that same problem if you're
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
being transparent about it and you're
 
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
raising the money to pay off that that
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
you incurred and you just like the last
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
minute you did a huge mailing thing and
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
you're raising you've got people you
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
know out there you're paying yourself
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
off or however they're doing it as long
 
01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
as you're transparent about it and it
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
was for that election so how long would
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
you have to do that
 
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
because I mean in theory I could do that
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
for an election and then two years later
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
be like yeah I'm paying off my 2022 debt
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
so give me uh the limit's 10K but you
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
can give me 20 because I'm going to send
 
01:45:44.689 --> 01:45:44.699 align:start position:0%
that first 10K back to that mail and
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
it's already gone out
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know what what would be a
 
01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:51.060 align:start position:0%
reasonable whatever reason I mean for me
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
the six months thing it seems to work or
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
you just do the end of the year I mean
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
part of me is it's a bit arbitrary but
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's entirely arbitrary I mean and then
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
you want to tie it into Wendy's the next
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
cycle begins so whenever that thing is
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
that date is that's the next cycle so so
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
I I I think I think you hit the nail on
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
the head so when does the next cycle
 
01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.850 align:start position:0%
the head so when does the next cycle
begin

01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
begin
 
01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.729 align:start position:0%
begin
whenever

01:46:15.729 --> 01:46:15.739 align:start position:0%
whenever
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
I'm totally I'm totally on board with
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
everything you just said just when does
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
it begins is it Jan one because that
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
that makes some sense like you can make
 
01:46:25.729 --> 01:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
that argument to me you can make you
 
01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:27.659 align:start position:0%
know January one of the next odd year is
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
the beginning of a brand new cycle
 
01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
um and that kind of keeps it in December
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
six months is a long time for me but you
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
know I'm not I'm not well I'm dying on
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
that if if the uh the concern is with
 
01:46:39.659 --> 01:46:41.689 align:start position:0%
that if if the uh the concern is with
transparency

01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:41.699 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
and the the contributions received and
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
applied towards a debt incurred in the
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
previous election that's all reported
 
01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:54.500 align:start position:0%
and it's all
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
readily obtained by the public which
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
would be the case if we did go to
 
01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
mandatory which would be more the case
 
01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
if we went to
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
a requirement that reports be be
 
01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.970 align:start position:0%
a requirement that reports be be
readable

01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
readable
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
right she already have that requirement
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't seem to be working too
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
well from the testimony we just heard
 
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
anyway if it's all transparent and
 
01:47:15.890 --> 01:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
people can readily look it up then they
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
know the facts and they can make their
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
own judgments regarding what the
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
candidate's doing with the money and
 
01:47:22.609 --> 01:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
where it came from I I guess the
 
01:47:24.129 --> 01:47:24.139 align:start position:0%
situation I'm trying to avoid I'm sorry
 
01:47:26.810 --> 01:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
not just on your point I I'm not sure I
 
01:47:28.129 --> 01:47:28.139 align:start position:0%
think this might be a bit of a corner
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
case because you're imagining a campaign
 
01:47:31.729 --> 01:47:31.739 align:start position:0%
that's carrying a debt that's going to
 
01:47:33.290 --> 01:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
go try to raise money to pay off the
 
01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
debt from the previous campaign while it
 
01:47:36.169 --> 01:47:36.179 align:start position:0%
also might want to raise money for a
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
future campaign
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
and and the the people who would give
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
money to the past that and to the next
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
campaign are people who are a super
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
supportive because they have a lot of
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
and I have a lot of money but B didn't
 
01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
max out in the previous campaign
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
and so you're super supportive super
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
wealthy contributors probably maxed out
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
in the previous campaign you can't raise
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
any money more money for them from the
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
past cycle anyway now so we're talking
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
about a very small number of potential
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
supporters who would be giving you money
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
after the election to retire debt right
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
up to the Limit and then give you money
 
01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
again for the next cycle correct but
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's not how the money would work so
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
this is the situation I'm trying to
 
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.810 align:start position:0%
this is the situation I'm trying to
avoid

01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
let's say I'm running for governor God
 
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
let's say I'm running for governor God
forbid

01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
forbid
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
yeah we agree yes
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
immediately the Pitchfork can sharpen
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
and immediately the Torches are lit well
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
it was just too easy and I take a
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars of my money and
 
01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
I shove it into my races alone and I
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
spend all 100 000 of that money right
 
01:48:39.050 --> 01:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
and let's just say the contribution
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
limit per cycle is twenty thousand
 
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
dollars for a candidate whatever let's
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
stage 20 we're obviously Dr Tinker with
 
01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
all this so let's say it's twenty
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
so I go out and I spend my hundred grand
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I have this hundred thousand dollars
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
in debt and then God forbid I win my
 
01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
election for governor right so I am now
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
I am now going to be in fact even under
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
some deadline I am now governor of the
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire there's a really
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
scary thing
 
01:49:06.649 --> 01:49:06.659 align:start position:0%
I can now go to you know John Doe super
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
donor who didn't support me in my race
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
for governor
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I can say yo uh give me 20 grand for
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
the last election and also give me 20
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
grand for the next election that's 40
 
01:49:21.590 --> 01:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
Grand I'm gonna say it's going to debt
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
wink wink wink nudge nudge and the
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
reality is I'm just going to take that
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
20 grand on paper I'm going to pay
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
myself off and then roll it right back
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
into the next election so that a person
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
has effectively just given me 40 Grand
 
01:49:34.850 --> 01:49:34.860 align:start position:0%
under the guise of paying off debt wink
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
wink nudge nudge because we unlike the
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
federal requirements in federal
 
01:49:40.189 --> 01:49:40.199 align:start position:0%
requirements you're required to have
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
separate bank accounts and all sort of
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
stuff in under our laws have segregated
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
funds we don't actually Define what that
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
means it can literally be paper
 
01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
means it can literally be paper
segregated

01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
segregated
 
01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's all it's all just how
 
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
you're accounting for it and I guess
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
that's my that's my complaint for it is
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
like if you want to go to unlimited
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
contributions you got to go to unlimited
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
contributions like whatever many states
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:04.070 align:start position:0%
have that
um

01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
but if we're gonna allow people to
 
01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
donate to a campaign after the fact or
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
under the guys that they're paying off
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
debt and I just know from working in
 
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
that industry that that paying off of
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
debt is going to magically get rolled
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
because I'll tell you what will happen
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'd be like oh I just paid off twenty
 
01:50:20.090 --> 01:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of my campaign debt and
 
01:50:21.590 --> 01:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to loan myself twenty
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars into the next year
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
conveniently and I wonder where the
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
money came from
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
but this would all be transparent
 
01:50:31.729 --> 01:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
we would know who donated money when
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
yeah a a alleged you know it would be
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
transparent except for it's an
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
accounting trick you know I I if the
 
01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
whole goal of this is to simplify this
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
and get it straightforward I I guess my
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
statement is we should limit the ability
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
to use accounting tricks and I know that
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
debt is an accounting trick I know that
 
01:50:48.590 --> 01:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
the debt is an accounting trick for
 
01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
these people because once they once
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
these campaign once these candidates put
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
their own money into the race I'm
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
telling you it is gone they have no
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
expectation it's actually coming back uh
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
and you could even make an argument to
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
me that they probably shouldn't be
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
getting it paid back because that looks
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about corruption that
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
realistic could they
 
01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:15.410 align:start position:0%
realistic could they
they

01:51:15.410 --> 01:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
if the date is January 1.
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
and they want to raise the money and
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
they go to the sky and say I want 20
 
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.350 align:start position:0%
they go to the sky and say I want 20
000.

01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
000.
 
01:51:26.689 --> 01:51:26.699 align:start position:0%
I mean part of it is do you you can't
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
start getting money for your new new
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
election until January 1 I don't know
 
01:51:35.570 --> 01:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
you can roll the ballots for it right so
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
I mean once again it's an accounting
 
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
trick well the balance is it's a debt so
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
you're just going to roll the debt
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
forward and you're still going to have
 
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
the debt on paper and then you're going
 
01:51:48.590 --> 01:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
to inject more debt on the other side
 
01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
you know it's or raise more or raise
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
more yeah it's it's like it's an
 
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
accounting the debt is an accounting
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
trick if it's an accounting trip if the
 
01:52:00.050 --> 01:52:00.060 align:start position:0%
objective is transparency by which I
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
think we mean
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
knowing who contributed
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
monies over certain threshold to a
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
candidate then we still are be able to
 
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
pardon me for
 
01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.790 align:start position:0%
pardon me for
continuing

01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's there's still
 
01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:23.689 align:start position:0%
there's there's still
uh

01:52:23.689 --> 01:52:23.699 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
there's still a limit
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
for a given campaign again I'm kind of
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
violates my principles of Free Speech
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
but that's beside I understand the
 
01:52:35.390 --> 01:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
notion of having to balance requirements
 
01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:36.659 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:52:39.410 --> 01:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
so you still have a limit for the 2022
 
01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.550 align:start position:0%
so you still have a limit for the 2022
campaign

01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
and we know who contributed money under
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
that limit
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
and we'll know the same for the 2024
 
01:52:48.290 --> 01:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
campaign now you were talking about
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
what's the cutoff for contributing to a
 
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
2022 campaign well it seems reasonable
 
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
to me that reasonable what a word huh
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.450 --> 01:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
we try to structure a deadline that is
 
01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
sufficiently in advance of the next
 
01:53:07.129 --> 01:53:07.139 align:start position:0%
campaign that it's seems clear the
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
money's going to the previous campaign
 
01:53:12.649 --> 01:53:12.659 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2024 for example
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
at least amongst State amongst State
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
reps were working a much shorter
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
schedules than the bigger campaigns but
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
say after January 20 after January 1st
 
01:53:24.050 --> 01:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
you can no longer contribute to the
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
previous even years campaign
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
that's a thought yeah no I I and I would
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
get over with that like but as long as
 
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
there's just a cut off date this that's
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
uniform it makes sense and doesn't allow
 
01:53:37.609 --> 01:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
because I I kind of share that world
 
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
view it should be transparency but when
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
you try to play limits like I heard what
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative Meerhead said you know
 
01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:45.709 align:start position:0%
representative Meerhead said you know
but

01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
I I just if if the goal here is to limit
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
the abilities to get around the law you
 
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
have to make it tight and you have to
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
make it consistent but you also to the
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
point you have to be able to pay off
 
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:58.139 align:start position:0%
debt like legitimate debt you have to be
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
paid off
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
um but I I guess I I do I I just want
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
the committee to be wary of the idea of
 
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
somebody wins elected office they're
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
carrying this debt and now they can go
 
01:54:11.149 --> 01:54:11.159 align:start position:0%
to this person who did nothing for them
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
in 2022 and now that person who may have
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
an interest no I understand
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
we'll dip that money but there's a
 
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
there's a question of balancing things
 
01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
on a slightly different topic by the way
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
related of course but uh
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
I do agree that there needs to be a
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
threshold below which individuals don't
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
individuals contributions don't have to
 
01:54:36.109 --> 01:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
be identified by name because there's a
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
long tradition of
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
Anonymous public political speech right
 
01:54:43.070 --> 01:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
The Federalist Papers were issued under
 
01:54:45.229 --> 01:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
pseudonyms correct that's not the only
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
example that's just a general thought
 
01:54:51.590 --> 01:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think I mean I spoke to this on
 
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
the first day
 
01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't I I think getting things like
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
people's employers address is
 
01:55:00.890 --> 01:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and
 
01:55:03.649 --> 01:55:03.659 align:start position:0%
overly burdensome into to what end
 
01:55:05.450 --> 01:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're somebody's
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's donating a ten thousand
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
dollars I think we all know who they
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
work for whether or not they put it on
 
01:55:12.649 --> 01:55:12.659 align:start position:0%
their file or not that's not a that's
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
not just some walking around money you
 
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
know and uh
 
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
as a secretary of state Scanlon and Mr
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
Fitch pointed out it's a question of
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
how much money is likely to cause an
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
undue influence that's a judgment call
 
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
I thought that was an interesting
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
because how do you balance that I don't
 
01:55:34.010 --> 01:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
know you said a number and we've got
 
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
right but do you do it by race because
 
01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
you know 5000 is a lot to me I mean like
 
01:55:43.250 --> 01:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
a lot I consider that real money yeah
 
01:55:46.270 --> 01:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I consider a quarter real money
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly
 
01:55:52.189 --> 01:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
but for the governor that's not
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's a drop in the bucket you
 
01:55:56.330 --> 01:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
know so I I don't know whether we set
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
the same amount
 
01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
for every race which I think is easier
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
to monitor
 
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
I mean but anyway I don't know but I
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
just thought it was insane
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
to that point I I think if the goal is
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
to streamline in this make a uniform it
 
01:56:15.649 --> 01:56:15.659 align:start position:0%
should be uniform and there is a you
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
know five thousand dollars to Governor
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
may not be allowed but five thousand
 
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
dollars to a state rep as a whole like
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's a lot that's a lot of money
 
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:23.570 align:start position:0%
that's a lot that's a lot of money
um

01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:25.129 --> 01:56:25.139 align:start position:0%
a thousand lots of money but I do think
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
whatever we set that number at I think
 
01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
it actually should be the same across
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
the board across all of it
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
um because the reality is if somebody's
 
01:56:34.729 --> 01:56:34.739 align:start position:0%
raising whatever the number is
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know I wouldn't set it at five
 
01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
thousand that's too hot that's too
 
01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
that's not low enough right
 
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
um that's too high another impression I
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
was left with is that
 
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.609 align:start position:0%
was left with is that
there's

01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
a considerable amount of low-hanging
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
fruit that we could pluck to improve
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
things in terms of
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
the laws being consistent
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
in less subject to misinterpretation the
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
example that uh representative Elena
 
01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lane and I have in common
 
01:57:06.410 --> 01:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
with the current online campaign Finance
 
01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:07.250 align:start position:0%
with the current online campaign Finance
system

01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
I still don't know exactly what the
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
right answer was
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
in fact when I when I hit submit
 
01:57:12.599 --> 01:57:13.729 align:start position:0%
in fact when I when I hit submit
yesterday

01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
I got a message that said this uh sorry
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
this transaction cannot be processed and
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
yet when I looked at the list of reports
 
01:57:25.010 --> 01:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
I had filed
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
the report I had just attempted to file
 
01:57:29.689 --> 01:57:29.699 align:start position:0%
was there yeah so that's why I said
 
01:57:31.729 --> 01:57:31.739 align:start position:0%
earlier I made a very I made a I put a
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
fair bit of time into trying to do this
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
right and made a good faith effort to
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
get it right and I believe my
 
01:57:38.089 --> 01:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
information is now publicly accessible
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
but there's glitches like that that
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
right you run across the same thing yeah
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
same thing so not just make good
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
because I did I thought what they told
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
me to do and then it showed up that I
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
actually had 500 instead of five because
 
01:57:58.609 --> 01:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
they said what's the amount of the
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
excess and it was 500 and something and
 
01:58:03.649 --> 01:58:03.659 align:start position:0%
so I put that in and then what it did is
 
01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
it showed that as being raised
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
right so it looks like
 
01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
it it it's not right but I don't know
 
01:58:14.570 --> 01:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
how to fix it I experimented some with
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
that I think I got an answer that's
 
01:58:18.770 --> 01:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
correct when I asked in that portion of
 
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
the site to put in the amount you're
 
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
you're carrying forward it's the amount
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you carried forward into the 2022
 
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:29.340 align:start position:0%
campaign not the amount you're carrying
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
forward from because when when I did
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
that their numbers agreed with my own
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet okay I think I'll be
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
amending mine yeah try try that
 
01:58:41.089 --> 01:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
I had the same sounds like we had
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the same very similar situation
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
to that point when we one of the things
 
01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
that I do think we should discuss is I I
 
01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be able to get on
 
01:58:51.890 --> 01:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
board collectively yes on the
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
streamlining on the simplification on
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
the universal dates
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
um I think we're going to get there
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I I think we
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
should consider is some form of either
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
amnesty or forgiveness period or let's
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
call it reconciliation into the new
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
laws so that people whose math doesn't
 
01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
add up or they're confused or whatever
 
01:59:18.649 --> 01:59:18.659 align:start position:0%
can just say I've got
 
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:19.980 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred dollars in my account
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's from these other campaigns you know
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
I'm and we're all moving forward now
 
01:59:25.850 --> 01:59:25.860 align:start position:0%
it's just something that if you want to
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
bring as many people out of the shadows
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
as possible I think you have to do
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
um and just have to move on and then and
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
then from that point the second the
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office can then take
 
01:59:37.729 --> 01:59:37.739 align:start position:0%
more robust enforcement because you've
 
01:59:40.010 --> 01:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
gotten the massive Come Out of The
 
01:59:42.649 --> 01:59:42.659 align:start position:0%
Shadow period if you will oh wow former
 
01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
member of election law joining us today
 
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.669 align:start position:0%
member of election law joining us today
greetings

01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
greetings
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
um but anyways I just think it's
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
something to say it's going to be
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
something that I'm sure somebody is
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
going to Tweet nasty things about it but
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
I think if the goal is to open up
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
transparency streamline things you need
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
to bring as many people
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
into the fold as possible and give them
 
02:00:06.770 --> 02:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
every incentive to do so and then after
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
that you can highly disincentivize them
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
coming out of the fault
 
02:00:12.890 --> 02:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
with your 50 day fines that they send
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
out those letters that I definitely
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
didn't receive
 
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I don't know what you're
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
wholesale rewriting of this whole
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
chapter yeah I agree it's it's going to
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
be a whole I mean look it's okay you
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be a what
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
wholesale rewriting of this chapter
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it well it has to be yeah
 
02:00:39.290 --> 02:00:39.300 align:start position:0%
otherwise what are we doing we're just
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
gonna sit here and fight over the
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
numbers and right like I I really I love
 
02:00:45.169 --> 02:00:45.179 align:start position:0%
you guys I just don't want to waste you
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
know six hours of my life here
 
02:00:49.850 --> 02:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
well I don't find your presence to be
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
away so let me reassure you if we don't
 
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:53.340 align:start position:0%
do anything it's definitely a waste
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
well I
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
I think of it as trying to put it puts
 
02:01:06.290 --> 02:01:06.300 align:start position:0%
the laws through a clarifying filter if
 
02:01:09.229 --> 02:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
we just make them more consistent and
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
right and ease and uh
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
simple to comply with while still
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
achieving the basic objective of
 
02:01:20.089 --> 02:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
transparency okay that seems to be the
 
02:01:21.290 --> 02:01:21.300 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm getting out of this
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
that's kind of our objective I think
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can do it
 
02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
so I I expect we can find something
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
we can actually find that we can all
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
agree on oh I I do too I just think when
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
the devil's always in the details when
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
you start writing it I think
 
02:01:41.209 --> 02:01:41.219 align:start position:0%
conceptually we can it's but so do do we
 
02:01:42.589 --> 02:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
want to start
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
tackling that do we wait I think we
 
02:01:46.609 --> 02:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
should start tackling because we're not
 
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:48.780 align:start position:0%
going to get anything past right I mean
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
now we're just we're doing a report
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
right we don't even know we don't we're
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee we don't right we're not
 
02:01:55.850 --> 02:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
handling a piece of legislation so I
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
mean we can we can take as long as we
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
could take as long as we want I I my
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
goal with this and in agreeing to do
 
02:02:04.609 --> 02:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
this was that we would come to a
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
consensus on something and that the
 
02:02:08.089 --> 02:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole would then
 
02:02:09.649 --> 02:02:09.659 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor legislation in the next
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
filing period okay some of that all six
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
of us can get on board with to show
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
strength and unity of that and I'm sure
 
02:02:17.149 --> 02:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
that there will be ideas outside of that
 
02:02:20.089 --> 02:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
and they will be handled outside of that
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um but then we can power something
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
forward that's actually that we can say
 
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats are on board
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
in this historically partisan committee
 
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
but we all agree on this and we can pass
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
it forward and that gives us the best
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
to send it through to our friends on the
 
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall who will then do
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
God knows well with it well from my
 
02:02:41.810 --> 02:02:41.820 align:start position:0%
perspective the first step would be to
 
02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:43.189 align:start position:0%
perspective the first step would be to
uh

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
write out something that's that's
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be long but just
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
spelling out what requirements we think
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
the campaign finds Finance system has to
 
02:02:56.810 --> 02:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
to meet for example establish
 
02:02:58.910 --> 02:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
transparency in the campaign fine the
 
02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
flow of campaign money
 
02:03:00.900 --> 02:03:02.450 align:start position:0%
flow of campaign money
uh

02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:04.669 --> 02:03:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's one requirement but there's going
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
to be subsidiary requirements because
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
there's other things we need to respect
 
02:03:09.890 --> 02:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
I think we need to respect the ability
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
of people who are not contributing
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
amounts of money that could be construed
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
as having undue influence on a candidate
 
02:03:20.089 --> 02:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
I think that we need to protect their
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh donate anonymously especially in in a
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
political environment that can become
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
very polarized and contentious
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want people to have to worry
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
that they're if it's a modest amount of
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
money we don't have to we don't want
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
them worrying about blowback
 
02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:40.990 align:start position:0%
them worrying about blowback
from

02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
you understand what I'm saying by that
 
02:03:44.930 --> 02:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't want to discourage people
 
02:03:46.810 --> 02:03:46.820 align:start position:0%
from contributing to candidates because
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
every last penny is subject to attack
 
02:03:52.609 --> 02:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
from somebody that they've never met
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
does that make sense right is that but I
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
guess I would want that to be a minimal
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
amount well that's that's where
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
discussion comes in well there's
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:04:05.410 --> 02:04:05.420 align:start position:0%
there is it's it's uh
 
02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
we raised it from 25 to 50 last uh the
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
last biennium and then it's anything
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
over 200 that's when the employer
 
02:04:14.570 --> 02:04:14.580 align:start position:0%
information kicks in right but I'm
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
saying we need to preserve that and what
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
that exact level is we have to discuss
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
but that but that's like a requirement
 
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
that we have a protection in there
 
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I agree and I I would make
 
02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
the armor that 50 is too low
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
and and that's part of the discussion
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
but there needs to be a limit below
 
02:04:37.490 --> 02:04:37.500 align:start position:0%
which someone can make a donation to a
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
candidate and the fact that that
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
candidate received the money from
 
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:41.950 align:start position:0%
candidate received the money from
somebody

02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
is is this is a reasonable requirement
 
02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just giving an example of no
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
you got a donation of 50 say you you
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
record that and report it
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just giving an example it's not
 
02:04:59.570 --> 02:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
just transparency there are other
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
requirements we also have to meet I'll
 
02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
be thinking about that myself and that
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
might be something good to spend a
 
02:05:08.089 --> 02:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
little time on at our next meeting to
 
02:05:11.930 --> 02:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
see if we have how much overlap we have
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
between what we see the requirements
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
being that next meeting will be next
 
02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
Tuesday by the way and
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't need to be the last
 
02:05:23.330 --> 02:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
meeting we could meet again it's not
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
going to be a short-term effort no this
 
02:05:25.739 --> 02:05:27.410 align:start position:0%
going to be a short-term effort no this
no

02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
right the wholesale rewrite I took it as
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
published on the State website the the
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
all I did was a little formatting so I
 
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
could read it easier but this is it here
 
02:05:43.189 --> 02:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:05:46.729 --> 02:05:46.739 align:start position:0%
probably oh yeah about 20 pages
 
02:05:49.550 --> 02:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
single spaced that's the cam pain
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
Finance stuff so it's not going to be a
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
short-term effort to run through that
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
and get it internally consistent while
 
02:05:58.910 --> 02:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
still meeting the requirements which I
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
think we should Define first
 
02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:02.820 align:start position:0%
okay I have to ask is this making sense
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
to people
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
so for our next meeting
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
we should I it would be a good idea I
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
think to at least have some preliminary
 
02:06:16.490 --> 02:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
ideas on what the requirements would be
 
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:18.050 align:start position:0%
ideas on what the requirements would be
and

02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh is anyone here averse to having
 
02:06:23.689 --> 02:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
future meetings
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
maybe monthly
 
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
we just need to make sure we time it
 
02:06:30.830 --> 02:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
that we're meeting frequently enough to
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
get the work done inside of the filing
 
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:33.770 align:start position:0%
get the work done inside of the filing
window

02:06:33.770 --> 02:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
window
 
02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
because I I imagine we'll have but we're
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
going to try to it's uh November right I
 
02:06:41.330 --> 02:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
don't I couldn't I should know it's
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
later in the year
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and then but the State House
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
is also closed at a certain point
 
02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't mean we can't meet at
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
another location you just have to go get
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
speakers blessing and he's
 
02:06:54.169 --> 02:06:54.179 align:start position:0%
last time I did that I got a little bit
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
of pushback but
 
02:07:00.890 --> 02:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.689 --> 02:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
yeah that's when you want to have all
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
the Minions right I think we should only
 
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.530 --> 02:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right okay so yeah I know I think we
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
need to meet once a month may not be I
 
02:07:22.609 --> 02:07:22.619 align:start position:0%
mean that might be a big yeah I'm not
 
02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:24.540 align:start position:0%
being I'm not being I'm just yeah this
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
is just kind of I guess the main thought
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
I have here really is that
 
02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
uh if we're actually going to make any
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
progress it doesn't seem like we can do
 
02:07:33.599 --> 02:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
progress it doesn't seem like we can do
anything

02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
with only one more meeting
 
02:07:40.609 --> 02:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
that's my main point scheduling I'm not
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking about here but it looks like
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to have a few more meetings
 
02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
I I think at our next meeting one of the
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
things that I think we could easily do
 
02:07:50.149 --> 02:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
is come to a consensus on what the
 
02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
reporting date should be and it sounds
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
like nobody really get pushback to
 
02:07:55.370 --> 02:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
making those reporting dates uniform
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
across the board for all various
 
02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:58.189 align:start position:0%
across the board for all various
organizations

02:07:58.189 --> 02:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I think people should come to the
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
next one with an idea of what what you
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
think that should look like
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
um and then we can
 
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that makes sense I still think
 
02:08:16.609 --> 02:08:16.619 align:start position:0%
we need to have a good you know my
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
experience was as a systems engineer
 
02:08:20.330 --> 02:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
where you start with requirements and
 
02:08:22.250 --> 02:08:22.260 align:start position:0%
you flow it down it's a and when you're
 
02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:23.820 align:start position:0%
dealing with a complicated system and
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's what this is
 
02:08:26.930 --> 02:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
that is a good approach but it doesn't
 
02:08:29.149 --> 02:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
mean we can't do some of the details we
 
02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
think we already understand that would
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
apply so that's an example
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
I'm almost tempted to do a control a
 
02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:37.580 align:start position:0%
delete but yeah
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
the control I'll delete control they
 
02:08:43.129 --> 02:08:43.139 align:start position:0%
delete and start again it's just so
 
02:08:52.010 --> 02:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:56.689 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:08:56.689 --> 02:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.330 --> 02:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
confused so because every time you
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
change something it's like right yeah
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's the ripple effect which is why
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is why something like
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
a fresh start should not entirely be off
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of cons out of
 
02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:14.099 align:start position:0%
out of discussion but it would also be
 
02:09:16.070 --> 02:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
satisfying to make some short-term
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
progress as well to encourage us
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
like for example come up with a uniform
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
set of reporting dates
 
02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well I I think what we should do is
 
02:09:28.729 --> 02:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
we should come up with a uniform set of
 
02:09:28.739 --> 02:09:30.109 align:start position:0%
we should come up with a uniform set of
principles

02:09:30.109 --> 02:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
principles
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
general concepts that we can all agree
 
02:09:34.250 --> 02:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
upon well that's the that's the
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
requirements I was talking about I think
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
and then so General General set of
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
principles we all agree upon and then
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
build almost just build from there
 
02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
what that looks like and we have our
 
02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
current RSA that we can look at for
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
reference and
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
and make sure that things that don't
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
fall through the cracks but that's
 
02:09:52.669 --> 02:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
honestly when you're touching something
 
02:09:54.410 --> 02:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
that complicated is this and as dense as
 
02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:55.250 align:start position:0%
that complicated is this and as dense as
this

02:09:55.250 --> 02:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:58.129 --> 02:09:58.139 align:start position:0%
you really to representative Lane's
 
02:10:01.010 --> 02:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
point it's really hard to go and touch
 
02:10:02.570 --> 02:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't ripple effect and
 
02:10:04.490 --> 02:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
then set off a bunch of firestorms it
 
02:10:06.290 --> 02:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
may actually be easier just to pull it
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
yes well yeah and as I was saying we're
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
going to do that with one more meeting
 
02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
no so we can just we can discuss when
 
02:10:19.089 --> 02:10:19.099 align:start position:0%
the next meeting should be
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
next week
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify something in my
 
02:10:28.609 --> 02:10:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:30.649 --> 02:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
it's going to include
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
does that include all these independent
 
02:10:35.099 --> 02:10:37.310 align:start position:0%
does that include all these independent
expenditures

02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:10:39.770 --> 02:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
groups that don't coordinate with
 
02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
campaign I mean I just want to figure
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
out because I think a lot of this gets
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
complicated because they were addressing
 
02:10:48.109 --> 02:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
different kinds of entities as they kind
 
02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
of came in to existence so I'm just
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
when we go through and get that when you
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
the three areas Pacs committees and
 
02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
candidates what distinguishes a pack
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
from a committee a Pac party packs
 
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
parties and commit and candidates oh Pax
 
02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
parties yeah
 
02:11:11.649 --> 02:11:11.659 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things to look at
 
02:11:14.689 --> 02:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
is how the feds handled the McCain final
 
02:11:14.699 --> 02:11:16.609 align:start position:0%
is how the feds handled the McCain final
transition

02:11:16.609 --> 02:11:16.619 align:start position:0%
transition
 
02:11:18.890 --> 02:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
because they moved from basically the
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
world of kind of Lawless Federal
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
elections into a highly structured right
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
thing so it's kind of I I do want to I
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
mean I'll ask Christina take a look at
 
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
how the feds handled that transition
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay because I yeah I started looking at
 
02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
the the FED stuff a little bit just to
 
02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
try and figure out
 
02:11:39.649 --> 02:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
you know so but for us then it's going
 
02:11:41.930 --> 02:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
to be the term political committee or
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
whether we call it political action
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee or whatever is going to be all
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
different kinds of committees
 
02:11:50.930 --> 02:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know I haven't really
 
02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
thought that through I think my goal
 
02:11:55.250 --> 02:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
would be to make one overarching
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
political action committee pack whatever
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
you want to call political committee
 
02:11:59.930 --> 02:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
whatever name we give it right the not
 
02:12:02.570 --> 02:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
party not candidate political arm okay
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
right and make it have Universal rules
 
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
Universal contribution limits and
 
02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
Universal guiding things of what they
 
02:12:11.689 --> 02:12:11.699 align:start position:0%
can do they cannot coordinate with
 
02:12:13.850 --> 02:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
candidates and political parties right
 
02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:16.139 align:start position:0%
so they can't coordinate they're their
 
02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
own separate entity that's that's you
 
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
know Barry and Lane getting together two
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
people getting a thousand dollars and
 
02:12:22.189 --> 02:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
starting to spend money on people which
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
would be interesting but
 
02:12:27.169 --> 02:12:27.179 align:start position:0%
um that that would be my idealistic view
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
we would get to that world which is why
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
I asked the question about you know how
 
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
do we handle things like citizens united
 
02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:33.109 align:start position:0%
do we handle things like citizens united
with

02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know soup like super pact and that
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
sort of thing because I think one of the
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
um attorney Fitch was off on is the
 
02:12:41.689 --> 02:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
citizens united did create a Gateway for
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
unlimited spending
 
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
um and we I'm sure we have philosophical
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
disagreements on that but it's a reality
 
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
that we have to and that's why I asked
 
02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:51.900 align:start position:0%
that question is how do we how do I how
 
02:12:53.450 --> 02:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
do we create one definition for a
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
political committee that also abides by
 
02:12:56.810 --> 02:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
that but doesn't just go into like
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
something that people who want to see
 
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
the restraint
 
02:13:14.810 --> 02:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
he said don't don't he he was highly
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
advising uh representative Elaine to uh
 
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
to uh yeah don't ruin my week maybe have
 
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
a glass of wine beforehand
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
because I I think
 
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think it was relied on on transparency
 
02:13:33.229 --> 02:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
and on disclosure as you know you can
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
you can have Free Speech but you have to
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
know who's giving the speech is kind of
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
how I've always thought of it as so but
 
02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
they've so I don't know about unlimited
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
I still it kind of freaks me we we will
 
02:13:47.209 --> 02:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
we will solve that not today but that's
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that was that was the point of my
 
02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
question was how do you
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
how do you have one definition that
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
balances that without right okay without
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
having nine different definitions of
 
02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
pack which is what we have now all right
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
things to create or problems to solve
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
that can take
 
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion before okay can can
 
02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
arrive at a mutually agreeable
 
02:14:12.649 --> 02:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
uh solution for lack of a better word
 
02:14:16.250 --> 02:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh then are we all
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
satisfied to adjourn this meeting
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
then the meeting is adjourned
 
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
