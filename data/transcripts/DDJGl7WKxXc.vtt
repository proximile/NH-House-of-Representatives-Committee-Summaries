we have to use the microphones this is
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 align:start position:0%
telecast out there
 
00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
telecast out there
so

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.869 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you audience for all being here

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
points where we need some help or advice
 
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.910 align:start position:0%
points where we need some help or advice
our

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
other other discussions
 
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.790 align:start position:0%
other other discussions
um

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee we're not
 
00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 align:start position:0%
the policy committee although we we've
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
broadened our admission out a little bit
 
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
because of uh the banking provision
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we need to discuss we did add one
 
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
member of the full committee
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
who who's
 
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
from from from
 
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.589 align:start position:0%
from from from
commerce

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
and then we have three members of
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
finance none can make it because they're
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
all tied up upstairs right now they'll
 
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
be here on friday when we have our full
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
work session
 
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.990 align:start position:0%
work session
so

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
um the thing though
 
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally we look at revenues from a
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
tax standpoint
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
this case it's a net
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of issues in the bill
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
that will
 
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
that will
impact

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh the net revenue
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
so our discussions may be broadened that
 
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
way because
 
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.190 align:start position:0%
way because
um

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
we may say well if we do things this way
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
the revenues the net revenue is going to
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
be this so if we do it this way
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
networking is going to be that
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
so so so bear with us we're going to
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
board this out a little bit to be able
 
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
to have those discussions
 
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
what i did for the committee is i came
 
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
up with bullet points
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
um i just went through the bill over the
 
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
um i just went through the bill over the
weekend

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
i went in the order of the bill just
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully for convenience for everybody
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh just to talk about things so i
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
have 14 points we want to make it
 
00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.629 align:start position:0%
have 14 points we want to make it
through

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then any other issues that any of
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
the members want to discuss
 
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
the members want to discuss
so

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
my first point was on page three where
 
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
we defined
 
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturers
 
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.350 align:start position:0%
uh manufacturers
on

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
lines four to seven
 
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.749 align:start position:0%
lines four to seven
uh

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
and then i'm i'm thinking to myself
 
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
and then i'm i'm thinking to myself
well

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
why why have manufacturers
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
i mean what manufacturers are we going
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
to attract
 
00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.909 align:start position:0%
to attract
uh

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be selling edibles
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
to the consumers here
 
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.590 align:start position:0%
to the consumers here
um

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm gonna take that and my second
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
point which is on line 19 to 22.
 
00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
and you know which says that we're
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
limiting edibles to only those with a
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
medical card
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
so a lot of things came to mind with
 
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.790 align:start position:0%
so a lot of things came to mind with
that

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
so we're going to be stocking edibles
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
but then having to tell people with
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
non-medical cards
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
you can't buy that even though it's on
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
the shelf
 
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's a problem for the retailer the
 
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.590 align:start position:0%
that's a problem for the retailer the
staff

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then once customers find out there's
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
no edibles being sold in these in our
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
state stores
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to lose
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
customers they're going to say well
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
screwed we'll just keep on going to
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that that we're allowing people with
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
medical cards to buy edibles
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
at the state stores
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
my note to myself here was places state
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
atc's in direct competition with the
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
state-run stores
 
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.830 align:start position:0%
state-run stores
harmony

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
harmony
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
atc's and then
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
then we heard testimony
 
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
that edibles are between 15 and 50 of
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
the market
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
of our state stores okay
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh or of the market out there but over
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
the weekend
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
i said well what are we really talking
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
about and it's this is where we're going
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
to need some help here
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh when we talk about edibles edibles
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
and adjustables if you look at a little
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
chart here
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
i went to flowhub.com
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
can someone out there tell me a
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
flowhop.com is a reliable source of data
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
nobody knows okay
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start position:0%
so it's
slash toolhub.com

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
dash industry dot dance statistics and
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
they claim and they had they had a chart
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
for last year 2020 for every month
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh what
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
what was sold in the various uh
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
recreational stores
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
so edibles and inject ingestibles was 18
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
pre-rolls seven percent accessories one
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
percent number accessories can come from
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
other manufacturers not the ones we're
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
talking about here topicals which is the
 
00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
talking about here topicals which is the
ointments

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
ointments
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
one percent
 
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
one percent
flour

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
flour
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
which is the traditional what everybody
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
thinks when they think of marijuana they
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
think of you know you buy loose
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana you roll your own
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then cartridges
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
26 now what's cartridge it's the it's
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
the vaping devices that instead of
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
having flavor in it that have marijuana
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
in it thc in it
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
or both all right you're my resident
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
expert i think i think nunes here is
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to be our expert
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then and then concentrates
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
which is 14 what are concentrates their
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
waxes and things like that
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
you take a little dab
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
you put it on the heat thing it goes
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
from solid to vapor
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a hookah thing and
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and you you take it that way
 
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.230 align:start position:0%
yeah and you you take it that way
so

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
i would imagine
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the manufacturers
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
would do the
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
edibles and adjustables they may even do
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
the pre-rolls because
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'd have machines that make
 
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:15.589 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'd have machines that make
them

00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
consistent size and you know and all
 
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.589 align:start position:0%
consistent size and you know and all
that

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
accessories can come from any vendor i
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
would imagine
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
topical same thing
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
it would be something these are all
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
you're extracting the thc out of the
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
plant and putting it into something
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
the flower we know is the plant is the
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
flower you know the flower part of the
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
plant cartridges
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
that would come from
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer and so same thing with
 
00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
a manufacturer and so same thing with
concentrates

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
concentrates
 
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.949 align:start position:0%
concentrates
so

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
correct me but i don't i don't see all
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
of these things um well i think there
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
was some of them defined
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
so you know i i i inadvertently
 
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.350 align:start position:0%
so you know i i i inadvertently
group

00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.030 align:start position:0%
group
all

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
when i saw manufacturing i was just
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
thinking of edibles and ingestibles at
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.509 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have a broader role they
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
would be making the pre-rolls topicals
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
cartridges and concentrates as well
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh i think we
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure in the bill
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
that that gets defined that way because
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're different kind of products
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
ingestible in ingest
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh whether it's a cookie or
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
brownie or
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
we have it in sodas i know i know states
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
have it in their sodas or some states
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
even have it in their beer
 
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
even have it in their beer
um

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.150 align:start position:0%
um
look

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
the five they find you the
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission said don't do
 
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.949 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission said don't do
that

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think we're planning on
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
doing that but
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
even though it's part of the liquor
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
commission this bill so
 
00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.389 align:start position:0%
commission this bill so
so

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
i i just think do we need a bit of a
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
discussion around that
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
do we need
 
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.350 align:start position:0%
do we need
um

00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
do we do we need to amend this bill to
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
be more specific
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
as to what
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
if we don't have
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
if we don't have
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
manufactured products
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
offered to the total public and not just
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
the meta people with the medical cards
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
then it's not much business because
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
according to this 33 is a flower
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
now again that's why i asked and uh mr
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
chair here
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
um i started by saying i got this from
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
flow hub
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've ever heard of
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
that site
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
nope and i see it blank so that's a no
 
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.310 align:start position:0%
nope and i see it blank so that's a no
okay

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that it was 15 to 50
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
of what sold
 
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.829 align:start position:0%
of what sold
is

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
is
is

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.389 align:start position:0%
is
edibles

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
00:10:54.399 --> 00:11:04.230 align:start position:0%
edibles
sure

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard of wide range
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
but the the consensus i kind of fall in
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
the middle on is that the manufactured
 
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
the middle on is that the manufactured
products

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
specifically edible products amount to
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
about a 30 market share but that market
 
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
about a 30 market share but that market
share

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
share
 
00:11:22.389 --> 00:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
is going up it's rising
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
and in some states it's even exceeded 50
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so even if we're at 30 it's perceivable
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
in four or five years
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
that would go higher but part of
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing also would include any
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
type of vape products
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
right which right here is about
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
again wide range but it's approximately
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
10 of the market share so the
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
i would say is pretty close to 50
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
already as is
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
i would believe and i i did notice in
 
00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
the data that i looked over the weekend
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
i could see that it was growing as well
 
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.389 align:start position:0%
i could see that it was growing as well
so

00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
so this is where the problem is i mean
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
so what are our state stores going to
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
sell if there's no no
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
no edibles
 
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.389 align:start position:0%
no edibles
representative

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
you want to comment on that or
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
if there were no edible products
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
obviously the state store would not be
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
selling those the concern i had with not
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
having any edibles would be would the
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing industry be able to
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
sustain itself without
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
without edibles i'm not sure that they
 
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.550 align:start position:0%
without edibles i'm not sure that they
can

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.430 align:start position:0%
can
and

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
i asked
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
people in the industry i understand that
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
they're in the industry and would make a
 
00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
they're in the industry and would make a
profit

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
off of this but when you take away a
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
large portion of their market share
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
i think it basically might not survive
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of that language and i'll
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
how it's written
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
was really that if someone
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
came to a state-run store
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
especially if they were from out of
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
state and they had a medical card they
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
could still purchase the edibles from
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
the store the idea was to not really put
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
a prejudice
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the medical industry
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
operating in new hampshire i understand
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
it's being perceived that way but the
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
intent was
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
the out-of-state consumer coming here
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
right okay representative want to ask a
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
question again or has a comment
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh mr chairman
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative abbas i know that um
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about about some
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
contention about medical being sold in
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
the stores
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
um do you have anything to say uh about
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
that about the rest of the medical
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
industry and maybe their feelings
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's people there in the room i'm
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
sure they're going to want to talk about
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
that as well but
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
well i'm i they'll do a better job
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
speaking about for themselves and their
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
feelings but my my thought was
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
if the medical industry
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
what what's sold in the state store does
 
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily have to be a medical
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
grade edible product
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
i understand that for medical purposes
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
they can have a much higher thc level
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
treatments inside that that product
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
specifically we're just saying that if
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
someone's using edibles for example if
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
someone had lung cancer they obviously
 
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.069 align:start position:0%
someone had lung cancer they obviously
can't

00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
i assume that they won't be smoking at
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
least they shouldn't
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not a doctor but i can imagine
 
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.949 align:start position:0%
i'm not a doctor but i can imagine
that's

00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's the consensus
 
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.470 align:start position:0%
that's the consensus
so

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
my concern my from my understanding the
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
medical cards
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
right now the medical industry there was
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
a law passed allowing them to accept
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
out-of-state medical cards but if that
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
policy hasn't been implemented yet
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the hold-up is on that
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
but i would support
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
i had no i don't see any reason why they
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be allowed to accept an
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
odyssey medical card either
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
in respect to
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
working together
 
00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
working together
if

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
the medical industry if they have
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
cultivation sites already
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
if they were to grow
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
cultivate and sell their products to the
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
state whether it's a lower grade doesn't
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
have to be medical grade whatever their
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
branding is whatever their product that
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
they make
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason why that wouldn't
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
state it seems to me
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
that that would be a win-win for
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
everyone involved they already had
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're already operational they already
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
have regulations in place they have
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
rules in place some of the criticism is
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
that the rule making process for the
 
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.389 align:start position:0%
that the rule making process for the
retail

00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
could might not it might be difficult to
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
make the deadlines well
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the medical industry
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of start and start from day one so
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
i think we can work together but i think
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
it needs to be
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
a mutual agreeable relationship where
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
we're all working together
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's actually my point five that on
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
this my sheep is
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
can new hampshire a c atc's
 
00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:41.749 align:start position:0%
can new hampshire a c atc's
atc's

00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
atc's
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
apply for these licenses given their
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
special status in the state
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
what needs to be changed for this to
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
happen do we atc's
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
i can answer that question i know they
 
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.189 align:start position:0%
i can answer that question i know they
did

00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
if this was a normal
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
run business
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
when we had the marijuana commission
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
and the commission one recommendations
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
is that we were going to give them a
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
pathway and it was testimony to that
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
effect too
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
effect too
to

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
we said give the atcs a pathway to have
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
a second part of their stores to offer
 
00:16:18.959 --> 00:16:20.710 align:start position:0%
a second part of their stores to offer
recreational

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
so but that's not in the bill
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not quite sure
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh whether
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
whether this
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know whether given the way we we've
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
the laws were surrounding our a
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
tcs have to be modified in some way to
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
allow that to happen
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
and can i
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
is this directly on that that point
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
because lang had his questions
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah okay you go first
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
part of his process i i'm trying not to
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
jump around we seem to be running
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
through this all this and not actually
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
having a good conversation on each each
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
of the 14 points
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
and i guess i want to go back to number
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
one and number two to have a good
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
conversation around one and two so we
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
can close that loop and finish the
 
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.590 align:start position:0%
can close that loop and finish the
conversation

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
but to the point we're specifically
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
talking about right now it was
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh was my inclination in our
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
conversations here hoping to get to the
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
point where we would allow
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
for the atcs either through a parallel
 
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.110 align:start position:0%
for the atcs either through a parallel
licensing

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
option to be able to sell to the state
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
if we carve that out so i think they're
 
00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
if we carve that out so i think they're
already

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
a lack of a bit of phrase homegrown
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
cultivators right here in the state that
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
would have a natural product to allow
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
the state stores to be able to start
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
selling once they open because otherwise
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
we'll be waiting months for someone to
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
grow a product to be able to sell to the
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
state if we don't give them a path
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
so if you if you look at this there has
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
unless we're looking at a year down the
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
road for to give cultivators time to
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
produce product
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we open a store the only place we're
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to get product right now
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
is from an atc cultivator it's currently
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
licensed and allow them to apply for a
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
cultivator and manufacturer license but
 
00:17:58.789 --> 00:17:58.799 align:start position:0%
we would need to make changes to the
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
current law to allow them to do that but
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
it was my inclination to if we're going
 
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
down this road to
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
to make to request that as part of the
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendment we make that change to allow
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
cultivators atc cultivators and
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um to your point about
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um again i think it's
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
along the same line right so
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a forward-looking bill
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
right the idea is we don't know what
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
this is going to look like in five years
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
from now and so defining the term so we
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
understand what they are so people can
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
alone privatization we have a definition
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis manufacturer is already in
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
statute it's only a matter of backing
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
out the state portion to now turn it
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
into a private portion
 
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:44.549 align:start position:0%
into a private portion
so

00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
um again i i think that a lot of the
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
terms you're seeing here is a is
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative atmos chairman abbott did
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
a great job in looking forward to what
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
are the potential downfalls or changes
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
that are going to happen in this law and
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
how can i put the definitions we need to
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
keep this forward-looking bill
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the future and and what might
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
happen so when i look at things like why
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
have licensed manufacturers the reason
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
being is a we may have products we want
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
to license that that are allowed there
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
could be a change in a law that the
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturing license process would be
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
there and especially if we allow the atc
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to sell to the state
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
products hashish is probably one of the
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
ones i was thinking about it's a
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
concentrate that would be allowed by
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
this statute um uh
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know so again
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to walk through the
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
your points you make really good points
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
in your in your document here but i
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
don't want to jump all over the place it
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
was related to
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
atc so that's fine that's fine thank you
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
and lastly i sort of remember the one
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
point i think what you know for me in
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
this whole conversation the operative
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
word is legalization
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
right the rest of it is all how we go
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
about it and we're talking about the how
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
right the question is do we agree on
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
legalization as a concept right and
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's a policy discussion that the
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee has already
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
made so now we're just looking about how
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
we go about it so i just want to say one
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
thing before uh
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
so we have atc's we have three companies
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
with seven stores
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they're vertically integrated just
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
understand what we have right now and
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
they're vertically integrated so they do
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
the cultivating they do the
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and they do the uh the
 
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.029 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and they do the uh the
retail

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the background that's what's
 
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.990 align:start position:0%
so that's the background that's what's
there

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they and if there's somebody
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
from any of those etcs that want to jump
 
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
from any of those etcs that want to jump
in

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.149 align:start position:0%
in
that

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:25.029 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
i know well let's go first but we do
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to know from the atc's
 
00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
if you're any of them representative
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
would help you out in terms of
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
and what we need to do to have that
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i wanted to go back a step um
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
and ask this question which is really a
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
question for the committee
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
and that is whether edibles having them
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
for sale to all consumers and new
 
00:21:02.159 --> 00:21:03.270 align:start position:0%
for sale to all consumers and new
hampshire

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
is on the table
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
that question of
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
of having them having edibles in the
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
retail stores for all consumers
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
is that uh is that beyond the scope or
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
the reason i think it is in scope and
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
the reason is that
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
that my position is that
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the edibles
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it's growing part of of retail
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
this isn't going anywhere the state's
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
not going to make any money i mean this
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
is it without edibles today
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to me at all i
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
mean the
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
the the revenue estimates that we're
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
getting are going to be even lower
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
because there's no edibles
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
and and i and i
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
and then the way the bill is right now
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to all we've done
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
now is put put the
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
the state stores in direct competition
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
with the atcs which is not a good thing
 
00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.190 align:start position:0%
with the atcs which is not a good thing
either

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
so we got to figure that out maybe uh it
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
would shed light on that
 
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.430 align:start position:0%
would shed light on that
question

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
our scope you know what we're into to
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
understand better why edibles were
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
excluded and uh
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
from this bill what what what's what
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
reasoning lies behind that other than
 
00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:20.950 align:start position:0%
reasoning lies behind that other than
maybe

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
i don't know representative abbott
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
this project
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
and many people know that i was not
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
the most uh pro cannabis guy
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's on record
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the process of doing this my goal was
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
to put something together that actually
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
has a realistic chance of getting over
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
the finish line
 
00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.149 align:start position:0%
the finish line
so

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:53.110 align:start position:0%
so
that

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
entails requiring what are deal breakers
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
with certain interested parties
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to speak on behalf of
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else but my understanding
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
is that if there was full edibles
 
00:23:02.799 --> 00:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
is that if there was full edibles
allowed

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.710 align:start position:0%
allowed
this

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
this might not make it over the finish
 
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.350 align:start position:0%
this might not make it over the finish
line

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
i personally i think having if you're
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
going to allow recreational use
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
it should be for recreational use
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
without a restriction on who can buy
 
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
without a restriction on who can buy
what

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
with the exception of an age yeah i
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
believe all the past but all the other
 
00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:27.990 align:start position:0%
believe all the past but all the other
marijuana

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
481

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
481
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i think your commission included
 
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
and i think your commission included
edibles

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but a compromise is a compromise i
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
understand right it'd be better to have
 
00:23:37.039 --> 00:23:37.909 align:start position:0%
understand right it'd be better to have
nothing

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
and let the whole
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
the whole agenda fall apart on
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
one line on a 15-page bill i thought if
 
00:23:45.279 --> 00:23:46.710 align:start position:0%
one line on a 15-page bill i thought if
anything

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's a provision that i think we can
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
revisit in the future but for some
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
people who have been really strongly
 
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.110 align:start position:0%
people who have been really strongly
against

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis a lot of this
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
might be too much too soon
 
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.630 align:start position:0%
might be too much too soon
and

00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think people are evolving people are
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
changing i'm showing the willingness to
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
change as people sitting on this
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
have moved a little bit as well so
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
it's baby steps i know a lot of people
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
have already already there but not all
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
of us are and i think this is a fair
 
00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:12.630 align:start position:0%
of us are and i think this is a fair
compromise

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.750 align:start position:0%
compromise
well

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
sure looks like a compromise
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
i mean this is what a compromise looks
 
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.390 align:start position:0%
i mean this is what a compromise looks
like

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.909 align:start position:0%
like
um

00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
but but when you think it through
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's like okay we compromised this but
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
ways it means we're looking at well what
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
kind of revenue we're going to generate
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this what kind of
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
revenue we're going to generate
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
and if we're saying we're going to give
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
up phil let's just use the 50 of the
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
business we're going to we're going to
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
say no can't use it
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's just going to lower the number
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
big time in terms of and then
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
will we lose customers i mean i i just
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
think this through i mean if i'm i'm
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's an atc in portsmouth but i live
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
in you know close to maine
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
i just go to the store
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
in maine and get my product because i i
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
i don't like i don't want to smoke this
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
stuff i want to i want to have my
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
cookies or whatever
 
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.549 align:start position:0%
cookies or whatever
so

00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know i agree with the logic that
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
and i don't i'm not sure many people
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that i think we're
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
going to it will the revenue side of
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
this will suffer if we don't have full
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
recreational edibles but again
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna have any revenue if this
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass and again
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
a compromise is a compromise and in
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
order to work with a lot of people
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's some provisions in
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
there that
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
if i wrote this myself and i was the
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
only vote and voice that mattered that i
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
would have wrote it the way you're
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting right thank you nunes has a
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
question so for
 
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
not not necessarily a question but maybe
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
just comment you know
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
where we always fall we always fall into
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
the political factor
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
of anything that we do in this
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
legislature there's a political uh
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
outcome that may be different than what
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
most people want or some people want
 
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.269 align:start position:0%
most people want or some people want
um

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
but but you know we're surrounded by
 
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.110 align:start position:0%
but but you know we're surrounded by
states

00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.909 align:start position:0%
states
that

00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
have recreational um cannabis sales
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
we had a a conversation here just a
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
while ago before this meeting started
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
says how many
 
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.310 align:start position:0%
says how many
people

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
are going to all of a sudden start using
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
the product because it's legalized
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
those people are already using the
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
product today it's just the money's
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
going somewhere else
 
00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:22.549 align:start position:0%
going somewhere else
and

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
um you know i know that there has to be
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
comfort levels for certain individuals
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe in in our body or in another body
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to be accepting of getting
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
this across the finish line and i think
 
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:36.830 align:start position:0%
this across the finish line and i think
that's

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
probably that's what i understand
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
part of part of the the problem is going
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
forward is that we've got to be able to
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
to get people to to believe in what
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to compromise you know make
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
compromises to make things happen my my
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
order is to stop arresting people that's
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
my order
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
and what that's what i what i'm on board
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
for i want i want legalization in some
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
fashion if this is the avenue that we
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
take then this is the avenue we take if
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's a better avenue then let's find
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
a better avenue but i think that this
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill could do a lot of good for a lot of
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
people even though some people think
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the state controlling it makes it a
 
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
that the state controlling it makes it a
monopoly

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
monopoly
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
but when we're when when we look at
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
what's being done with the revenue then
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
it's a win for everybody in the state
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to say that before we
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
got started
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
again i'm not advocating either way
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's a committee we could we could
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
say no keep keep the edibles out
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
keep all of that out
 
00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
we just have to adjust our revenue
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
estimates then we have that means we're
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to adjust how the money
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
gets spent
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know do we do we give 25 do we
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
give 25 million because remember finance
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be involved in this
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
discussion as well
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
does it mean 25 million comes off the
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
top to go to uh prevention and all that
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
and then then
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
then the rest goes to or is 25 million
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
too much
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
if we're only going to bring in you know
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
40 million
 
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.789 align:start position:0%
40 million
net

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
net
 
00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
net
tim

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
tim
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
so around the financing i already have
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
some proposed language for that or some
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
proposed ideas around that and i guess
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
when we get to that number we can start
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
talking about it but to hershel's point
 
00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:12.149 align:start position:0%
talking about it but to hershel's point
again

00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
all of this is meaningless if it doesn't
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
turn into law right we can have all the
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
arguments we want about edibles and
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
everything else but if we don't you know
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm with herschel legalization is the
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
conversation right stop arresting people
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
for for this at this point and so if i
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
have to baby step into this i'll baby
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
step into this to to make it i think you
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
know like herschel i'm not sure i like
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of a state-controlled model but
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
that seems to be as the governor said
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
this weekend right just this weekend he
 
00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
thinks 1598 is the mechanism that can
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
get the legalization
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
so the more we monkey with it
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's may change that opinion and i
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
want to see legalization i want to get
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
this off the plate of cops
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
i want to have them you know i want to
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
not have our citizens be arrested and
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
fined um for these products um you know
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
i i spent 13 years in uniform and i as i
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
said earlier i've never been to a
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
domestic violence case due to marijuana
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
um right so that that's a fact right so
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
um to hershel's point i don't think all
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
of a sudden because we legalize it we're
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
going to see 50 of the population decide
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they want to do it right
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to change now it's legal i
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
can do it i'm going to go do it i think
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
that the percentages aren't going to
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
change when it comes to edibles
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding is between the two
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
other places this has to visit after it
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
passes the house that may be a deal
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
breaker and we'd get no legalization and
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
herschel i think you looked up how many
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
bills we've the legislature's played
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
with since
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
um matt simon's here in the crowd i
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
think he might even have the number more
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
than i would have the number because he
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
was the lead activist here trying to
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
push for it for many many years
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
um and um i i was i was in a meeting um
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
not too long ago back in november uh
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative abbas you were there
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
and we were talking about legalization
 
00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh it was over in manchester and
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
um you know i printed out i printed out
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we've had we've been introducing
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
cannabis legislation to this body since
 
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.950 align:start position:0%
cannabis legislation to this body since
2003

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
2003
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and something happens every year
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
something happens and it and something
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
squashes it well
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
78 of the people
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
want it
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
so why don't we have it
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
we work for the people
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
so to my point i guess i i'm like
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
herschel it's a it's a baby step model
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
right we've been dealing with this for
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
two thousand i can't imagine the
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars the
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislature spent alone arguing over
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
this discussion um never mind all the uh
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
all the people have been arrested since
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
2003 on these products so
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
again um if if this is the line in the
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
sand edibles
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to say okay i'm fine with
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
keeping it the way it is or
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
i know there was conversation but just
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
removing edibles out of the liquor store
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
and just making it a providence of a
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
providence of the of the atcs and let
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
them sell it and just keep the flower
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's still looking at if i read this if
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
i do my math right we're still looking
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
at over 50 percent of the revenue coming
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
in so does the revenue model drop from
 
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
250 to 12 150 sure i mean 125 but if 125
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars isn't worth the
 
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
conversation um and to allow something
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
to go through i'm not sure what we're
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.630 align:start position:0%
talking about
okay

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
murphy and representative no no thank
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
you um
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah obviously the um
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
the issue of legalization is not in our
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
purview right now and i would agree with
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
you didn't see a lot of domestic
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
violence due to marijuana and i really
 
00:31:40.159 --> 00:31:41.269 align:start position:0%
violence due to marijuana and i really
saw

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
saw
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
car wrecks in the emergency room
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
secondary marijuana alone it was usually
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
always alcohol or some other drug beyond
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
marijuana so i would agree with that
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
part of it but
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
having said that
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
if edibles are not on the table then
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
simply we have to adjust our revenue
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
projections i mean if that's not here
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
and this is the baby step that we have
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
to take going forward then that's the
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
baby step we haven't taken one forward
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
but my
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns is
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis you know
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
programs in the state
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if this will in any way be harmful
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
because in retail or in state-run stores
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have counseling
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have education so
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
my concern would be as long as i feel
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
that the therapeutic cannabis programs
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
are not harmed than taking a baby step
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing the revenue shortfalls as a
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
result of not having edibles seems to be
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
a reasonable way to proceed
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
so do we know do we i was under the
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
impression that maybe the therapeutic
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis programs may be in some way
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
harmed by this
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
do you know that
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
well they would they would if if we say
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
you can buy your edibles right at the
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
retail stores
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's definitely i think we
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that that'll that'll
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
definitely uh take customers
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
they say well
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
because it'll probably be well if it's
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
just sold to them
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
the economy scale is here uh you know
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
but the whole goal is the state would
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
probably undersell under price the
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know but my i think pretty
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
strongly that
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
that well the state stores will unders
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
on the price what the atc is because
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
they offer more of a service than
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
than the retail stores won't provide any
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
service to what the dosage should be and
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
all that
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a concern and then we
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
need to talk about that so i agree we
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
have to we have to talk about do we
 
00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
we keep the bill the way it is
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
but then we have to adjust the revenue
 
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
but then we have to adjust the revenue
estimates

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then what are we going to do for the
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
atcs and there's two things there
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
this is do we take that out totally
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
you have to buy it from the uh
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
you have to buy your
 
00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:50.950 align:start position:0%
you have to buy your
edibles

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
at the at your atc
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
not in amer in the stores which means
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
strip out edibles totally
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh would be the first thing and then uh
 
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
it would be you know
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
the the re-adjusting the uh and then
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
do we allow
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
the atc's
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
to be the
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
cultivators and the
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturers
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
that sell to
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's the compromise we have to reach
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
then i'm okay with both those things to
 
00:34:25.359 --> 00:34:26.310 align:start position:0%
then i'm okay with both those things to
allow

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
allow
both

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
both the uh let the atcs have a parallel
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
license um to be able to sell to the
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
state and then additionally if if we
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that it's going to
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
harm the harm the medical industry i
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody here again we're
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
talking about 18 of the revenue
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
according to this this flow hub
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
language 18 of the revenues and edibles
 
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.790 align:start position:0%
language 18 of the revenues and edibles
again

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's to get the legalization i'll
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
happily give that up and and protect the
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
atc so they can do their product
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
can you react to that
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
i i agree with what representative lang
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
said about allowing the
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
kind of i call it the partnership
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
between the state and the medical
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
organizations i
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
my only comment on the harm or potential
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
harm to the medical
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
side of this is
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
that conversation never came up
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
during the public hearings on hb237
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
which was the sales tax transfer tax and
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
that would have allowed edibles
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere that also never came up last
 
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.470 align:start position:0%
everywhere that also never came up last
year

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
during the hearings on hb 481
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
which was this similar bill as hb 237 so
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it came up big time on our company
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's only been raised it was it's not
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
being raised as an issue with any of the
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
cacrs that we're scheduled to hear
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
a vote on
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully on tuesday
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
if things go as scheduled it only seems
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be brought up in
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
in respect to 1598. so
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
i understand that there may be some
 
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.390 align:start position:0%
i understand that there may be some
overlap

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
overlap
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to say that i assume if
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
someone is is
 
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
using cannabis for legitimate medical
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
reasons i do not understand why that
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
person would all of a sudden stop going
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
to a medical facility
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
and now start just buying it at a
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
recreational store if there's other
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
benefits that that they receive that are
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
not going to be offered in the retail
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
store it seems to me
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't make sense that person
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
would no longer go and receive the full
 
00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:17.270 align:start position:0%
would no longer go and receive the full
benefits

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's just my understanding also just
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
because it's an edible it doesn't mean
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
that it's medical grade so my
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
understanding is products can be
 
00:36:24.079 --> 00:36:25.270 align:start position:0%
understanding is products can be
specifically

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
medical grade products and if the if the
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
medical facilities do not want to sell
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
the medical grade to the state that is
 
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
the medical grade to the state that is
their

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
as the manufacturer that's their choice
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
we want to hear from atc's on that right
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah you can you can yeah
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
we may have you come back up of course
 
00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.230 align:start position:0%
we may have you come back up of course
but

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
my only concern is that price point
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
would be a competitive reason for acts
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
to be a problem
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh i just i guess i'm sort of
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
methodical about things like this and i
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
i think the uh it seems to me that the
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
um first question that i asked about
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
whether we're going to
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
consider taking
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
the prohibition
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
is the threshold question and my senses
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
is that we're not and it's either
 
00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.069 align:start position:0%
is that we're not and it's either
because

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's a ruling that it's part of the
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
policy that came to us which i kind of
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and is
 
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.349 align:start position:0%
and uh and is
or

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:37.349 align:start position:0%
or
um

00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want to take it out because we
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
can see that it's an essential piece of
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
the compromise that was built
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
to get this bill to us but uh but if
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're over that
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
let's set that
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
behind us
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
and look at this bill and see uh
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
a number of things
 
00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
how that plays out in terms of the
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
revenue is obviously a big piece of
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
a big consequence of that decision and
 
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
a big consequence of that decision and
uh

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
and with
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
i i will we'll get to the revenue
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
numbers but i i heard that 250 million
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
dollars a moment coming down 125 million
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
dollars and i guess
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of persuasion that's going
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
to need to be done just give me two
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
revenues at that higher level
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
all right so i think what we'll do is if
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
we can do this we'll take little mini
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
votes here to see where we're at
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
i mean is there anyone who wants to
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
tamper with
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
adding edibles back into the bill for
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
recreational i does anybody want to
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
and i i i see no hands
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
so that that's a threshold does it want
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
to or is it a reasonable way to proceed
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
to get to an end you know compromise
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
are we going to be blocked if we pursue
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we can always revisit it right but
 
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
my sense from the conversation was
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
that let's not touch that
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen then when we go
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
to our revenue discussion
 
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a big variable okay
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
we know
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be added back in
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
because we we've agreed that's not going
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
to be added back in so
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
is that as they are it's going to stay
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
as as it came to us right but we'll
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
proceed through this we may come to a
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
point where we say oh my goodness
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
but that that helps so right
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then you can come back and say what
 
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.670 align:start position:0%
and then you can come back and say what
if

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
well basically that's that's what we're
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
going to try to do so
 
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.309 align:start position:0%
going to try to do so
so

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:16.319 --> 00:40:17.829 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:21.750 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean i guess we'd have to do
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
the same thing as we i mean harm to the
 
00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
the same thing as we i mean harm to the
atc's

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
atc's
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
technically is in our revenue thing it's
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
harm to the atcs
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere i i think we have to have the
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what i was going to bring up
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know when
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
where i i don't think we're talking just
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
about edibles as a whole
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
edibles being provided at the public at
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
the state-run retail outlet that is in
 
00:40:54.309 --> 00:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
direct competition
 
00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
with the atc's and their business
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
that was put in statute by us right okay
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
so um so i think that we have to we have
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
to get to that conversation and and to
 
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.550 align:start position:0%
to get to that conversation and and to
determine

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh is it is it in
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
is it in their favor is it in our favor
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with that i
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
believe hb 605 was the bill that allowed
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
cross state
 
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.150 align:start position:0%
cross state
um

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh sales from medical is that correct
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's it's not in effect yet though
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct and
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that it's a rules thing if i'm not
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
mistaken it's hung up in rules thank you
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
very much for your nods back there i
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
remember uh your you being present
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
and those
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
those the pricing that may be in place
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
for them and this is all subjective
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
but um may take care of what could be
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
sold in this in a state-run facility
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
next door to a liquor store or wherever
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be placed
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
because of because of pricing they may
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
already be coming ready to come across
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
the border to buy from them so um
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is uh
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
when you look at the consumer base of
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
people who are going to come into a
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
state facility
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
and they see that
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
edibles can be sold to one
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
piece of the public but not to another
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh there's going to be an issue
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's let's try to resolve that
 
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:27.670 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's let's try to resolve that
okay

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
let's move forward okay
 
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.309 align:start position:0%
let's move forward okay
so

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
my uh third point
 
00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:36.630 align:start position:0%
my uh third point
was

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
page six when you say
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
this is something that i i
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
wanna do
 
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:54.470 align:start position:0%
wanna do
page

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i when you look at the um
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
page five when you look at
 
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
page five when you look at
um

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
oh it's it's page five third lines
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
thirty to thirty seven and page six uh
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
lines one to fifteen has to do with the
 
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.990 align:start position:0%
lines one to fifteen has to do with the
um

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.589 align:start position:0%
um
rules

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
and it seems like a
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
really tight time frame
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
to get the rules done
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
i'll ask you
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
tim um i mean you're on jail car
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
but where we assume the bill is signed
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
and if it passes it's signed in
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
june or something like that
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
by october 1st the commission has to
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
adopt rules
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
that seems like a really tight time
 
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.430 align:start position:0%
that seems like a really tight time
frame

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
to do it the reason i think it's related
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
to revenue that it it may take longer
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
than that and the revenue won't start
 
00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:48.230 align:start position:0%
than that and the revenue won't start
flowing

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
flowing
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
um because of that
 
00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.430 align:start position:0%
um because of that
so

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
tim you're being on gel car do you have
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
a comment on that i agree i think i
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
think they're the
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
putting dates in here
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
are probably problematic
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
hard dates um i i think again if we're
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.230 align:start position:0%
 
know

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
car putting i think i'm trying to
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
remember the process for public hearings
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
and notice
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
and all of those kind of things i
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
remember it's almost a six-month process
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
for a rule to go from
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
the commission puts forward a rule and
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
then all the public hearings that have
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
to occur and all the votes that have to
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
occur it's almost six months from start
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
to finish
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and so this would be a little
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
problematic i'd be more inclined to just
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
saying by you know december 31st which
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
gives them six months you know from from
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
the time the law is adopted to be able
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
to get the rules and it means they have
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
to hustle a little bit but it's probably
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
doable i do agree that the october 1st
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
deadline is probably too tight for
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
jalcar to be able to get everything done
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
do you recommend that we just take the
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
date out
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
put it put us put it extend it a little
 
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.589 align:start position:0%
put it put us put it extend it a little
bit

00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
i would uh
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
what were you saying give me one second
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
give me one minute to read that and see
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
how i think i could be better
 
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
how i think i could be better
uh

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
if i can just interject here that
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily that there are time
 
00:45:14.309 --> 00:45:14.319 align:start position:0%
frames that jalka has to meet
 
00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:15.109 align:start position:0%
frames that jalka has to meet
but

00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
as representative lang's offering if if
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
we put in a date of december first
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
december 31st it allows for that time
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
frame and and these
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
departments and commissions need to get
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
their job done you know and and they
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
tend to i know you've experienced this
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
they tend to lengthen the process
 
00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.430 align:start position:0%
they tend to lengthen the process
and

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh well it's actually let's put them on
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
the point
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
liquor has to meet that deadline and
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
then eventually goes to jail car
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
somewhat upset
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
i strike the first whole sentence and
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
just put
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
no later than december 31st 2022 the
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
commission shall adopt rules pursuant to
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
well i think it it's important because
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
it has to do with when they can get
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
we know we if they don't have rules
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to start revenue
 
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
we're not going to start revenue
generation

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
you can't open a store until you've got
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
the rules around the store so we have to
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
have some sort of timeline for them to
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
be able to adapt so we can if we put
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
this in place we can start estimating
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
somebody agree with that
 
00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.349 align:start position:0%
somebody agree with that
anybody

00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:46:23.359 --> 00:46:24.870 align:start position:0%
anybody
okay

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
oh sure
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.030 align:start position:0%
oh sure
uh

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
so this uh the regulations
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
here talk about the registration of
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis establishments so rules for
 
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:37.430 align:start position:0%
cannabis establishments so rules for
that

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
and then in another part of the bill
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission is given licensing
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
authority right to issue licenses
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis licenses is on page 12 in the
 
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
cannabis licenses is on page 12 in the
middle

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
middle
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
starting at line 16. right
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
and so we got registration
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
the first part of the bill under one of
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
the statutes
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
which is uh i think at the title
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers but uh and then we've got
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
page six you're talking page six line uh
 
00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:06.790 align:start position:0%
page six you're talking page six line uh
21

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that where you are
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
well two places we've got what we were
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
just looking at right page five
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
and the registration is for the
 
00:47:15.839 --> 00:47:16.870 align:start position:0%
and the registration is for the
uh

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
our rules relative to the registration
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
and regulation of cannabis
 
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.430 align:start position:0%
and regulation of cannabis
establishments

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.870 align:start position:0%
establishments
and

00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's a registration requirement for
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
each of the types of cannabis
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
establishments somewhere else
 
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.230 align:start position:0%
establishments somewhere else
but

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mesh with the language
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
that's used for the
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
liquor commission on page 12 which is
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
licensure language
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
i just don't square it so it's a
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually the licensure language is on um
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
is on page if you look look at page six
 
00:48:05.119 --> 00:48:07.190 align:start position:0%
is on page if you look look at page six
line

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
line
line

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
 
21

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
down so it says the liquor commission
 
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
down so it says the liquor commission
shall

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
shall
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
accept a accept and process applications
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
beginning no later than may 1st
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
for cannabis cultivation facilities
 
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:21.829 align:start position:0%
for cannabis cultivation facilities
right

00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
and beginning no later than august 1st
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
of 2023
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
for cannabis product manufacturing
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
facilities cannabis transporters and
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis testing facilities what are the
 
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.630 align:start position:0%
cannabis testing facilities what are the
issues

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
is your registration application 90 days
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the application the rules we're just
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
talking about that so mr chair if i mean
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
so again this is a chicken and egg kind
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
of situation is that we have to adopt
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
rules the rules would include what the
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
forms look like for registration all of
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
those kind of things and then they can
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
begin to accept and process applications
 
00:48:57.599 --> 00:48:58.309 align:start position:0%
begin to accept and process applications
so

00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:58.319 --> 00:49:00.829 align:start position:0%
so
again

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about first they
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to establish the guidelines and the
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
rule you know the rules the rule making
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
on the five on under 541a
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
and establish all of the things that
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to do
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
they have to they have to create rules
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
because that's generally what we do is
 
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
we give it we give authority to an
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
agency to make rules to implement the
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
law we just passed
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
and then it's up for them to just to
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
figure that out and bring it to job car
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
um and usually it involves several
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
conversations with lots of people i know
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
when we were doing the sports betting
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
rules we're doing historic horse racing
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
rules a lot of conversation with
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
legislators about legislative intent and
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
about conversations around those kind of
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
things so they can adapt the rules to
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
meet what the len
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
the law says
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
and so i think here you're talking about
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
when they can start processing
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
applications but the real rule-making
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
authority and and i do agree we have two
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
different sections where rule making is
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
is talked about we have the section that
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about on page
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
five and the regulation of cannabis and
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
adopting rules and then we have another
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
so there are two sets of rule making and
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
i think the second set of rule making is
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
a little more detailed than the first
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
but again remember the agency's
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
requirement is to implement all rules
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
for the entire law
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
so even if we limit it in here somehow
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
and they go well wait in order to do
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
this we have to
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
put a regulation around investigations
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
they'll have a whole separate even
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
though we don't tell them they have to
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
do rule making on it it's part of the
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
law and the passage of the law so
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
they'll adopt that anyway well if i may
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
respond um it's i think it's a simple
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
problem to resolve as i said i think
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's probably a drafting issue and you
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
could simply say on line 33 of page five
 
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.589 align:start position:0%
could simply say on line 33 of page five
the

00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
commission shall adopt rules regarding
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the registration licensure
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
and regulation
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
of all
 
00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:53.109 align:start position:0%
of all
cannabis

00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
establishments and
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's just just line 33 of page five pick
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
up licensure
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
because that's the term that's going to
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
be used as they go out and actually
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
license and it's the traditional term
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's used so where's this research
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
around what
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
add regulation
 
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.390 align:start position:0%
add regulation
yeah

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
then we can get rid of the section in
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
the back no you leave you leave the rest
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
that's an amendment to the commission's
 
00:51:19.839 --> 00:51:20.829 align:start position:0%
that's an amendment to the commission's
basic

00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
basic
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
statute yeah
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
oh right we're reading right now they've
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
got a whole list of licensure
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
obligations okay yeah okay that's that's
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
that one then
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
since it's may of may 1st of 2012 and
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is when they do all the
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
forms and everything else that they have
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
that all that rule making
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
has to be done by may 1st for the
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm on page six
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh line
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
line 21 through
 
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:01.430 align:start position:0%
line 21 through
24.

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
so again mr chair just point out it says
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
no later then
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
versus a hard date which means that if
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
we finish the rules in december and
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
jalcar votes on in january they can
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
start accepting applications in february
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
so once the rules are set then they can
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
they can proceed so that that's fine but
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i do need to follow up
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
what is the difference between
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're using two terms here so it gets
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
really confusing
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
here you know the obligation is to issue
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
a registration which
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
is clear within 90 days at the receipt
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
of an application
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
well where does licensure come in well
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be that the registration is
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
simply the form that you put forward to
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
say i want to open this
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
shop whatever it is licensure comes to
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
your your evaluation of whether the shop
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
does it right whether it's you know
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
the type of milligrams in there that
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
sort of thing you're right i think it's
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
applying they're applying to
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
to be a cultivator let's say
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
then if they meet all the requirements
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
they have the background checks and all
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
that yeah then then they would get then
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
they would qualify to
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
be licensed right right
 
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
be licensed right right
um

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
well it'd be good to say
 
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.630 align:start position:0%
well it'd be good to say
somewhere

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.870 align:start position:0%
somewhere
okay

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
all right again that that one that one's
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
way off ways it means yeah but and i
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
brought it up though so it's but i think
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
we picked up a few things here that we
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
need to do so
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
i want to keep on going because we want
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
to try to go no later than 12 30 today
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
um line six
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
on on
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
main page six
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
lines twenty one that
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
i had to put it somewhere 21-23
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the one thing that we
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the actual license
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i know tim and i chat about this
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
earlier but um offline
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no fee schedule in
 
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.790 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no fee schedule in
there

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
what a cultivator license would be
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
initial and then subsequent years
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
same thing with the
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
reta there's no retail the retailers
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a license because they're
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
but we the the cultivators the testers
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the manufacturers licenses and
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
transport i guess there's a transporter
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
license in here
 
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
there's no fee schedule
 
00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.630 align:start position:0%
there's no fee schedule
and

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know i guess the question is
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
this is no fee schedule we can't
 
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.470 align:start position:0%
this is no fee schedule we can't
estimate

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
what those revenues would be it won't be
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
compared to the total it won't be big
 
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.990 align:start position:0%
compared to the total it won't be big
big

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find my hand out from the
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana report
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
i have to
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
hear mr chair so when i when i is this
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
one you're looking at here this this
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
tabling thing this will give you a sense
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know these are from a couple years
 
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.910 align:start position:0%
you know these are from a couple years
ago

00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh let me let me take colorado
 
00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.950 align:start position:0%
uh let me let me take colorado
um

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
there's an application fee and then a
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
license fee let's just talk about the
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
license fee
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
um alaska
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
cultivation a thousand to five thousand
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%

retail five thousand testing a thousand
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'll pick i'll pick um one more
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know massachusetts being
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
application fee 3000
 
00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:49.820 align:start position:0%
application fee 3000
maximum

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:49.830 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
maximum
[Music]

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
of 15
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
000 for cultivator manufacturer retail
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
a license and testing maximum of 10 000.
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
they must have some variable thing in
 
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.710 align:start position:0%
they must have some variable thing in
there

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
so i mean those are kind of ranges that
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're that you're dealing with
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
we had suggested
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
application fees
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
all different kind of licenses that is
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to ask to be
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
considered to have a license
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
and then once you get approved for the
 
00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:24.710 align:start position:0%
and then once you get approved for the
license

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh we said retail but we're not talking
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
about retail here but that was ten
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
thousand to fifteen thousand initial
 
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.349 align:start position:0%
thousand to fifteen thousand initial
year

00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
six thousand to nine thousand subsequent
 
00:56:33.359 --> 00:56:34.789 align:start position:0%
six thousand to nine thousand subsequent
years

00:56:34.789 --> 00:56:34.799 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:56:34.799 --> 00:56:36.390 align:start position:0%
years
testing

00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
five thousand seventy five hundred
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
initial year three thousand to uh for
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
forty five hundred
 
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.630 align:start position:0%
forty five hundred
um

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
et cetera i mean i i i
 
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.870 align:start position:0%
et cetera i mean i i i
so

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
i guess when you're in the grand scheme
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
of things i guess in the grand scheme of
 
00:56:52.079 --> 00:56:53.430 align:start position:0%
of things i guess in the grand scheme of
things

00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's not going to skew our revenue
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
estimates that much look at it
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
if i made mr chair again because we talk
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
about in the bill that has a limit on
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
cultivators 15.
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
if i do the math it's basically if you
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
had somebody if you had one unique
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
cultivator manufacturing testing times
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
15 we're talking 165 000 a year
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
would be the maximum revenue at 15
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
cultivators 15 manufacturers and 15
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
testing facilities
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
um and again i think that number is
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
not significant although i hate to say
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
that people think that 165 thousand
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
dollars is insignificant but
 
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.349 align:start position:0%
dollars is insignificant but
but

00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i think in the grand scheme of of
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
this bill it's not a significant issue
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
and i will say that the legislature
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
historically at least recently
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
has been putting more and more onus on
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
the department that developed the life
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
the fee schedules i know that fishing
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
game i just passed a bill to change the
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
hike safe card take the fees schedule
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
out of let of statute and give it give
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
541a recommendation so that the agency
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
can be dynamic and adjust and adapt
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
based on what's going on we did the same
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
thing in oplc
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
we gave them some rule making authority
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
to be able to create their own licensing
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
structure with the provision that the
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
licensing structure has to be
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh lack the paraphrase and
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit model right that it has
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost of licensing and the
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
of of the process of
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
registration or licensing so i think
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
it'd be probably inconsistent with the
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
history of the legislature over the
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
recent years to start putting hard fixed
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
costs for licensing into the bill itself
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
well traditionally we do get
 
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
well traditionally we do get
those

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
but maybe less now i don't know i mean
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
the hike the hike safeguard
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
came to waste him he's years ago when it
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
was first issued and we actually we we
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
just signed off someone came up with a
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
fee and we signed off on that fee level
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh way back when um but anyway
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
so i i for the purposes of this
 
00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.030 align:start position:0%
so i i for the purposes of this
discussion

00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
it you know
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the background it's a hundred
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
thousand or maybe 150 000
 
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:00.640 align:start position:0%
additional revenue but it's not going to
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
be the deal breaker for this bill
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
i think so whatever
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
again the bill
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have fees i guess it assumes
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
what you were just saying representative
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
and that that
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
that the elected commission would come
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
up with their free
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
schedules all right
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
so let's move on
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh number five
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the ac atc's i sorry
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
for my typo there
 
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.069 align:start position:0%
for my typo there
um

00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have a yeah
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
just thinking about that
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
isn't that true that the liquor
 
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.270 align:start position:0%
isn't that true that the liquor
commission

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
fee schedules for
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
its other licensing act it's a current
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
law licensing activities are specified
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the statute right now yes they're in
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
the statute three pages so here we are
 
00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:51.829 align:start position:0%
the statute three pages so here we are
just

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
proposing to hand it over to the liquor
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
commission with no legislative direction
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's certainly an option but
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's not what traditionally has
 
00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.030 align:start position:0%
that's not what traditionally has
happened

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
no i i think ways and means should weigh
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
in but myself uh what maybe we need to
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
spend a little more time on that um
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what the numbers would be
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
but uh because the fees
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
i mean we were
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
we represent the people as legislature
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
in some way that we should weigh in on
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
these fees
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
if we think they're unreasonable
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
that you know if we leave it to the
 
01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.789 align:start position:0%
that you know if we leave it to the
agency

01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:26.799 align:start position:0%
are they being reasonable or not
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't directly report to
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
the p we do not not them
 
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.470 align:start position:0%
the p we do not not them
so

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.910 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i was surprised it was in the feed
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
schedule and that's why i brought it up
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
i you know i thought there'd be a fee
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
schedule in it
 
01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.829 align:start position:0%
schedule in it
um

01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i can't i can't speak for the other
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
states whether it was in their statutes
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
or they came up with the fees in another
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
way i don't know
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
but mr chair yeah so i i can tell you
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
again over in jaipur
 
01:00:54.559 --> 01:00:55.750 align:start position:0%
again over in jaipur
we've

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
denied um
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking based on we thought the fees
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
were too high and we've we've uh we've
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
we've sent it back for rulemaking to
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
adjust the fees so remember any any fees
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
that are set have to come in front of
 
01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
jalcar does have a legislative process
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
for the setting of fees uh through
 
01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.270 align:start position:0%
for the setting of fees uh through
jalcar

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
jalcar
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
and again they're under the their
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
agencies are under that component of it
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
can't be our for-profit making system
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
they have to justify their fees and
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
expenses so
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
it allows them again to be adaptive
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
because a fee set this year may be
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
completely different than a fee that's
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
needed five years from now because with
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
inflation economy and everything else
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's going on nobody knows
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
so if we hard code this
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
into statute we're going to have this
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
argument in five years
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the reason why the agencies
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
have generally been left now to the
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
if they want to make a rule change to
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
change a fee they have to come in front
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
of jalcar and prove why the fee is now
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
goes from a thousand dollars to fifteen
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars whatever it is but i
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
think by
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that where have the
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
expertise or the or the uh
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh know how to set what we think the fee
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
should be so it's not a money making
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity i have no idea what it would
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
cost liquor to
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
investigate and license somebody
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
well this is certainly uh
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
no one wrote us a memo to say that this
 
01:02:13.599 --> 01:02:15.029 align:start position:0%
no one wrote us a memo to say that this
was

01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
that this was this the sea change in
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
the way fees because traditionally i've
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
been you know
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
represented major's been around a long
 
01:02:23.119 --> 01:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
represented major's been around a long
time

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
i've been here 12 years
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
we always we always get bills that have
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
fees in them that we they come to us to
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate one way or another
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so i i guess i need to get a sense of
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
do we just want to not worry about the
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
fees because they're not in the bill
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
or do we want to address the fees
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
i'll ask it to
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
who wants who wants to address the fees
 
01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.230 align:start position:0%
who wants who wants to address the fees
anybody

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
who doesn't want justice
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
i guess the real question is do we want
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
to leave the fees to rule making or do
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
we want to set the fees in statute
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the question yeah well
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
right that was yeah so you know
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
if it's my opinion again i'd rather
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
leave it to rulemaking to allow the
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
agency to be dynamic and adjust as it
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
goes along and it still has the
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
rule-making process to be able to if we
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't like it we can shut it down
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
could we
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
find a middle road that would identify
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
parameters that the
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
commission would work on for fees
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
that would be you know you sort of
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
alluded to the parameters you say jr
 
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.470 align:start position:0%
alluded to the parameters you say jr
jailcar

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
jailcar
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
looks to when it reviews these things
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
could we put in some words i don't know
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
what i did haven't looked at this is
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
there anything at all in the in the bill
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
right now on uh
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
standards for
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
setting fees
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
the only fee i see in here is this one
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's on page six line 19 which is for
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
go to 250 dollars to the municipality
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's the only fixed fee i see in in
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
here i'd have no objection would just
 
01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
again under the rule making authority we
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
can just put a line in it says
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
fees will be adopted
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know again not not to make a
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
profit i don't know how we would word
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
i just want to keep this moving along so
 
01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.789 align:start position:0%
i just want to keep this moving along so
that

01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to stay in my my my
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
points here so
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
the atcs
 
01:04:50.799 --> 01:04:53.670 align:start position:0%
the atcs
um

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
we got to know
 
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.630 align:start position:0%
we got to know
what

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
we can and can't do
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
with the atcs
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
allowing them to
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
of being manufactured being cultivators
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
being able to apply to be cultivators
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
and apply to be manufacturers
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
and even apply to be transporters
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
to get those licenses
 
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
to get those licenses
to

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.270 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.230 align:start position:0%
um
to

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
you know by the way
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
i want to get to the transport apart but
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
so i need to hear from the atc's can can
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
someone uh
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate you
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak for
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
the record matt simon i've been with
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
prime atc since last summer prior to
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
that i spent 10 years working with the
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy project was involved in
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
efforts to pass adult use legalization
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
laws in
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
all three neighboring states and
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere as well so i have multiple
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
perspectives here and certainly worked
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
with the study commission quite a bit
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
back in the back in the day
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
a couple just general comments and then
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
i'll try to respond to all the questions
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
that i that i've heard so far and if i
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
forget any of them please re-ask them uh
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
we believe the best approach to adult
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
use cannabis legalization is more or
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
less what was recommended by the study
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
commission a reasonably regulated free
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
market approach with relatively low low
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
taxes and an independent
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis commission
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
hb 1598 is not that it is not our
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
preferred approach to legalization at
 
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.029 align:start position:0%
preferred approach to legalization at
all

01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
i have serious questions about whether
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's a workable policy some of which
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
you've already
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
begun to ask but since it has passed the
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
house and we're here in this committee i
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate that your many of you are
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to make this work
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find ways to understand how it
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
would impact the tcp and the atcs
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to participate in those
 
01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.510 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to participate in those
discussions

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.950 align:start position:0%
discussions
and

01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.390 align:start position:0%
and
so

01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
you've heard the concerns and how do we
 
01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
another general comment so
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
all of the revenue related questions to
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
me come back to one
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
overarching question which is what kind
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
of market are we talking about creating
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
is this a market that people are going
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
to want to shop at or is it a market
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
that they're not
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
so it's important to look at what the
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
neighboring states have done
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is a relatively free
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
market system but it's a very corporate
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
system with high barriers to entry the
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
prices are somewhat higher there
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that being said the market is maturing
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
prices are coming down they've been at
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
it several years i checked last week
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
there are now 387
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
licensed adult use retailers in
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts there are 296
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
licensed cultivators
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are 225 licensed manufacturers of
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
so the stores that are along the
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
right across the border many of them
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
will have products from 5 10 15
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
different companies consumers who are
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
able to pay the premiums and there is a
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
tax associated with it but they have a
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
market that has many selections for them
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
maine has prioritized craft cannabis
 
01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
from the very beginning uh they've had
 
01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
caregivers growing cannabis since 1999.
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
caregivers can serve five patients so
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
they've been growing a fair amount of
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
cannabis and a few years ago they all
 
01:08:39.269 --> 01:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
got the ability to basically open
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
storefronts and serve patients directly
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
so it is a very
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
less regulated market than new hampshire
 
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
less regulated market than new hampshire
has

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
and all of those caregivers they made it
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
easy for them to get into the adult use
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
market the adult use market just opened
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
last fall
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
but it is already very robust i spent a
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
few days in portland last week i got a
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
receipt from one of the stores did a
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
little shopping talked to some people
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get some perspective
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
prices are already lower than
 
01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts even though they've just
 
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.149 align:start position:0%
massachusetts even though they've just
opened

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
opened
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
they have 77 retail stores in maine
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
58 cultivators
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
and 35 manufacturers with active
 
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:16.630 align:start position:0%
and 35 manufacturers with active
licenses

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that's only being up a few months i
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
think that number will be triple in a
 
01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
think that number will be triple in a
year

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
they will have a lot of
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
supply and a very robust market full of
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
options for consumers so
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
we already hear from patients in new
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire who are registered they only
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
have three companies to choose from in
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire they have thousands of
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
caregivers to choose from in maine
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
those caregivers don't have to have
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
their products independently lab tested
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
and they don't have anywhere near the
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of startup costs and overhead
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
costs that
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
we do so a lot of our patients do go to
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
maine and we we understand that on the
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
my point is that they have a huge head
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
start vermont is a little bit behind
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
them they haven't opened retail stores
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
yet but that will also be a very free
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
market system relative to what we're
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
talking about here this is frankly the
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
least free market approach to
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
legalization that's ever been considered
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
in any state and that is fundamentally
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
the reason i think
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
it will not produce
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
the successful results that
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
some believe in terms of
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know capturing the illicit market or
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of producing revenue
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
going back to study commission i think
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
one of the best pieces of advice the
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
study commission received was from
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
colorado andrew friedman was the first
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
regulator and what he said was if you're
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
doing this solely for the money you're
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
doing it for the wrong reason
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
so that's priority is revenue for the
 
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
so that's priority is revenue for the
state

01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's always been pretty much the bottom
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
of my list i think there's a lot of
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
really good things that are accomplished
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
by effective cannabis regulation
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
transitioning illicit market into a
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
regulated market protecting consumers
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
giving consumers access to a regulated
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
safe product providing education public
 
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.950 align:start position:0%
safe product providing education public
education

01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to try to create a
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
culture of responsible use around
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis which prohibition absolutely
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
does not do
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
people buy cannabis from illicit dealers
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're introduced to an illicit market
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
that might try to sell them other things
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
and uh they certainly don't know what
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're getting they don't know if it's
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
covered in pesticides they don't know if
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's five percent thc or 25 thc so i see
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for a really successful
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
policy here and i'm encouraged to hear
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
some talk about revenue not being the
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
main the main goal but i know that it is
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
a main goal for others and i know it's
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
focused for this committee so we have to
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
so this brings us around to here we are
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this is going to work i
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if 15
 
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
don't know if 15
cultivators

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
i've become pretty familiar with the
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
different types of cannabis businesses
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
and there's a pretty good analogy to be
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
made to beer
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
we're all familiar with the large
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
corporate beer scene and we know that
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
there is craft brewing new hampshire
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
takes great pride in its craft breweries
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
we have a bunch of them everybody likes
 
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
we have a bunch of them everybody likes
them

01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
we recognize that the quality is a lot
 
01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
higher in vermont the way they framed
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
this over the course of years
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
policymakers kept talking do we want to
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
create the budweiser of cannabis or do
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
we want to create the heady topper of
 
01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:20.390 align:start position:0%
we want to create the heady topper of
cannabis

01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
and what they wound up with was a bill
 
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.709 align:start position:0%
and what they wound up with was a bill
that

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
very much privileges craft cannabis
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
small cultivators they have six
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
cultivation tiers the lowest smallest
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
here is very accessible very easy for
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
anybody to to get involved with so
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
that would be what would be attracted
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
here because any company that's going to
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
risk a market where there's only one
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
buyer and that buyer is the laker
 
01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:54.229 align:start position:0%
buyer and that buyer is the laker
commission

01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that says
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
they have to buy your product
 
01:12:59.430 --> 01:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
federal legalization could happen next
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
year open up interstate commerce liquor
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
commission could simply follow its
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
existing model they could import
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis from wherever it's the cheapest
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
we never have to have a cannabis
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire some people
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
might think that's a good thing i happen
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
to think that the jobs and economic
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities and are
 
01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
an important part of legalization and
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
they're certainly part of the revenue
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
conversation if you want to have
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
cultivators and manufacturers that are
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
paying business profits and business
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
 
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.189 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
so

01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
i worry about the overall market i worry
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
that as represent former representative
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
hannon said that it will be perceived as
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
government cheese relative to the free
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
market craft cannabis models in
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
neighboring states and i think that's a
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
huge risk
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
from us as an atc perspective could we
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
expand and supply this market
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
we have some ability to expand our
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
biggest constraint on that is our
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
non-profit status that limits our access
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
to cap
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
let's talk about that so that's a big
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
issue from our perspective
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be allowing 15 of the
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
largest publicly traded cannabis
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
companies to move into new hampshire and
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
set up corporate cannabis and tell the
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
atcs that they have to remain non-profit
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
not going to work and we're just not
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to be able to
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
support that if that's what's moving
 
01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.470 align:start position:0%
support that if that's what's moving
forward

01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
but if we are able to transition to
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
for-profit uh that would give us the
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
access to capital we would be able to
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
expand and be one of the suppliers
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
for this system
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh would that get us to neutral on the
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill i don't know but we're we're happy
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
to talk about what it might look like
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
and there was a bill to do
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
that bill didn't pass did it
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
605 did that pass
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
605 is out of state sales so the
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
for-profit bill the last one was sb 38
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
it was vetoed by the governor
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
it was overridden by the senate and was
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
two votes short in the house but i do
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a copy of the governor's
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
veto statement i think it's really worth
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
looking at because it
 
01:15:02.229 --> 01:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
raises some important issues and and to
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
be clear our position on this is very
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
nuanced and i
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
prime was neutral on sb 38
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
within the context of having regional
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit monopolies that are dictated
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
by the state that we're the only people
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
i was a little uncomfortable with that i
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
supported i've been a supporter of the
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
non-profit status all along because
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're only allowing three companies to
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
operate in the space and i thought it
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
made sense that they should have to be
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
non-profits but that being said
 
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
what other business produces things and
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
sells them and has to be a non-profit
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
salvation army is the only one that i
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
can think of can
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe somebody else knows one but
 
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.910 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe somebody else knows one but
i

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's really difficult
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
so in the context of allowing
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses to operate in new
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire if you let them do it you
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
should let the atcs do it
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
that's our view okay
 
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:58.470 align:start position:0%
that's our view okay
so

01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
but okay so there's two steps to that so
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
so there's two steps to that first
 
01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
that would be that on your mind it would
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
only work if we
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
we made them for-profits
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
they could be able to compete that way
 
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.870 align:start position:0%
they could be able to compete that way
uh

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:15.910 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
obviously they would have to increase
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
capacity on the growing and probably the
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing side
 
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
manufacturing side
um

01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
as well is that correct oh yes so
 
01:16:32.790 --> 01:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have to know what what what
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
would have to change in the statutes to
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
allow that to happen
 
01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:40.870 align:start position:0%
allow that to happen
um

01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
i know you're representing one
 
01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.189 align:start position:0%
i know you're representing one
one

01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
right i can only speak for myself in
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
prime atc i know michael holt is back
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
there from the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
program and you may be able to comment
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
on some of the specifics of how
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
two regulatory regimes
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
might work i think it can be made to
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
work i i don't think it's the best way
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
to do it because well here's the other
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we had
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
in the cannabis in the marijuana we call
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
the marijuana commission then you know
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
we're no
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
more pc we call it the right name
 
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.550 align:start position:0%
more pc we call it the right name
cannabis

01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.990 align:start position:0%
cannabis
so

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
we talked about giving a pathway
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
in that in that report we gave the
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
pathway for the
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
atcs to be able to also sell
 
01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.229 align:start position:0%
atcs to be able to also sell
recreational

01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
one thing we said you have to separate
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
the sides of the store
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
and have two separate entrances i think
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
that was the main the main thing can you
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
just talk about that what you're seeing
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
in other states like you mentioned maine
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts how are they handling that
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
how do they
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
how are they working side by side with
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
the atcs or are they
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question uh
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
every state except one that i'm aware of
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
has managed to maintain a viable
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis market and the way
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
they've done that primarily has been by
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
allowing dispensaries to transition and
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
engage in adult use sales if you do that
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
correctly it increases the economies of
 
01:18:11.030 --> 01:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
scale you're able to offer cheaper
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis not only to adult consumers but
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
do that i think there should be rules
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
that require the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
dispensaries to continue serving
 
01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:27.110 align:start position:0%
dispensaries to continue serving
patients

01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
there have been a few other states where
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
prices have gone up for patients as a
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
result of this and that's you know i i
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
believe the prime would voluntarily make
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
sure that didn't happen but that doesn't
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
mean you shouldn't make rules
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
requiring us not to harm patients
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh by prioritizing
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
the other marketplace right but where
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
we're at i mean this bill
 
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
is the state runs the retail stores so
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
right i don't see how that how do we how
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
do we mesh
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
i think we have two competing things
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
with under the state umbrella here
 
01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.350 align:start position:0%
with under the state umbrella here
where

01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
the atcs are technically competing with
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
the these yes typically new retail
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
stores can you just comment on that
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
number i can't and to be clear since
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative abbott mentioned the
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
previous bills both hb 481 and 237 i
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
just looked up 237 there are 11
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
references to alternative treatment
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
center they it explains it assumes that
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
we would be able to sell cannabis so we
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
are included in that model and that's
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
why i think you didn't hear the atc's
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
object so given if we're not going to
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
allow atcs to sell cannabis we have to
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
find another way to
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
to make this work and
 
01:19:32.719 --> 01:19:33.510 align:start position:0%
to make this work and
uh

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's at least theoretically possible
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
that a limited license model that only
 
01:19:38.719 --> 01:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
that a limited license model that only
allows

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
i just don't see how three
 
01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.910 align:start position:0%
i just don't see how three
cultivators

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to produce enough
 
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.790 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to produce enough
product

01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
without compromising quality i mean it's
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's easy to say you're going to grow
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
five times as much as you're already
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
growing and not
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
compromise any quality on this very
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
sensitive agricultural product the
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
reality is i mean we did a major
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
expansion last fall
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
completed it last december and it it
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
took i don't know six months eight
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
months before
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
all the new systems were dialed in and
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
everybody was really comfortable with it
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a big it's going to be perceived
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a business risk by i think any
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
cultivator that each company each of the
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
three companies has their own
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility correct
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
one facility each yeah they use one
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
some have recently expanded okay
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
so and so they're all under the lights
 
01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:27.430 align:start position:0%
so and so they're all under the lights
right

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
not not yes they're all under lights and
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's another issue the main business
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
owner i talked to last week they have
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
both the medical and they're wholesaling
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
into the adult use market they have a
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
greenhouse that's solely for medical and
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
they have a greenhouse that's solely for
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
adult use and we're not currently able
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
to operate greenhouses right in new
 
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
to operate greenhouses right in new
hampshire

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
in other states that have both adult
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
sale and also cannabis or therapeutic or
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
atc type models
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
are they merged in most of the states
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
right now and if not other licensures
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
different between the two and
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
how onerous is that a difference in
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
licensure requirements
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
so in the vast majority of cases
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's an option
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
the the medical cannabis dispensaries
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
can remain medical only or they can
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
transfer to adult use only or they can
 
01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
transfer to adult use only or they can
remain

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
remain
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
dual use and and have a situation such
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
as representative romney mentioned with
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
separate interests and separate separate
 
01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.030 align:start position:0%
separate interests and separate separate
counters

01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
counters
 
01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.709 align:start position:0%
counters
it's

01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
all three neighboring states have opted
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
for independent cannabis commissions
 
01:21:38.550 --> 01:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
that regulate all things cannabis so
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
the vermont cannabis control board is
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
assumed responsibility of medical
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis as part of that transition
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
and they're regulating all all cannabis
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
and in maine it's the office of
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana policy and massachusetts is
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
the cannabis control commission
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh in in all those cases
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
it part of the transition was to unify
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
all cannabis regulation under one office
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i think it makes all the sense in
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
the world uh there's yet another reason
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
that hadn't come up that i wasn't aware
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
of until a year ago but it's the hemp
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
derived thc products that are now
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
proliferating other states are cracking
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
down on them there's a vape shop two
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
blocks from my house that will sell you
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
delta eight thc
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
vape cartridges which are absolutely
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
psychoactive somewhat less psychoactive
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
than delta nine but they're readily
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
available i don't know if they check ids
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of them on the wall so
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
other states are cracking down on that i
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
think we should have regulation of it
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's another reason that a
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis commission that regulates all
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
things cannabis to me is by far the most
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
sensible approach to policy and the one
 
01:22:44.229 --> 01:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
that most states have been following and
 
01:22:44.239 --> 01:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
that most states have been following and
developing

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if those states are now and our
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
surrounding states are all controlled by
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
a governing board that then can regulate
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
the product both adult use and
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use what have what have our
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring states or across the country
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
seen in the use of the black market i
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
mean have they seen a decrease in that
 
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.629 align:start position:0%
mean have they seen a decrease in that
or

01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh or not it takes time to change
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
consumer attitudes and behaviors i i
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
would say
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
vermont doesn't have any stores open so
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
they haven't eliminated the illicit
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
market except by giving people the
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
option to grow at home which eliminates
 
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
maine

01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
maine
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
i think a lot of people would describe
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
that more of a gray market situation
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
with so many caregivers and
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of storefronts and
 
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of informal cannabis
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
commerce that happens that probably
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
isn't ideal and
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
less regulation
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
everybody understands that maine is
 
01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:43.910 align:start position:0%
everybody understands that maine is
supplying

01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
supplying
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
the region with a lot of it's a
 
01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of its its cannabis
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
but when you hear the talking point that
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
regulated adult use doesn't eliminate
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
the black market and you know despite
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
colorado selling billions of dollars
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
worth of cannabis how does that make
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
things worse
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
people are conflating
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
the the market of coloradans
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
who consume cannabis and the the
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
national market for cannabis which is
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
still prohibition in the vast majority
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
of states so
 
01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
criminally minded individuals who have
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
bought houses in colorado as soon as it
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
became legal and thought ah i'm going to
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
grow a whole house full of cannabis here
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ship it to new hampshire
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i'll be able to do that under the
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
nobody will notice because there's so
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
much legal cannabis and
 
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.110 align:start position:0%
much legal cannabis and
well

01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
people do notice they get charged with
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
felonies and
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of enforcement around
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
this trip they strip all the everything
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
out right of the house
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
the problem is those lights at night put
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
the lights in keep you up so just one
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
and they do that here too i mean we've
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
had whole house grows busted in new
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire just to follow a follow-up it
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
would is a revenue question actually
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
have in your experience or others
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
experienced in the country seen with the
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
increased regulation and
 
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
increased regulation and
commission

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
control of cannabis use across the
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
country have they seen in any state a
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
decrease in the alcohol consumption or
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
purchasing because that's obviously a
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
big revenue portion of our budget so
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
have they ever seen has that been
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
correlated um frankly i was hoping that
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
would happen i think cannabis is
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
objectively much safer than alcohol so
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that would i think that be beneficial it
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't generally it's it's been a very
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
negligible and what would you say is 12
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
to 15
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
of this population i will actually
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
consume cannabis is that
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's different reports on that i mean
 
01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.070 align:start position:0%
there's different reports on that i mean
it

01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's not for everybody
 
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
it's not for everybody
absolutely

01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
it would never approach it never
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
approach alcohol i don't know no i mean
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
they're it's it's complicated the
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
reasons that people choose not to
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
consume cannabis i'm never sure whether
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
people rarely face a pure choice uh
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
between alcohol and cannabis without
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
other factors
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
involved and big the biggest ones being
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
drug testing for employment and
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
fear of a social stigma people have
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
family members who would judge them for
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis use don't judge them for
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
drinking bourbon
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're still there thc stays in your
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
system a long time
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine i mean you're not
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're not uh impaired but it's there
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's detected for if you get a blood
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
test or just 10 minutes
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
so i just want to get back to where we
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
started this conversation
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
so would you your organization would be
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
in favor if we were to amend this bill
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
to allow the atcs to be able to
 
01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
cultivate and sell to the state through
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
a parallel licensing program
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't say in favor i think
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
neutrality is
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
the closest the best that we could
 
01:26:37.709 --> 01:26:37.719 align:start position:0%
possibly support
 
01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
hb629 which would allow home grow and
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
possession we're all for that one
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
creating a market is is
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
there a lot of issues here and uh i i
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're a long way from supporting it so
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
i'll rephrase you won't oppose the idea
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
of allowing the option for the atcs to
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
be able to sell to the state
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't oppose that
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm here to discuss what that might
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
look like but we are opposed to the bill
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
until we see an amendment that gets us
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
trying to craft language for the
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
amendment it'd be nice to know if i
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
mike are you willing to come up in a
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
minute mike
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
to safety
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
i was echoing uh representative lang
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
here we're we're talking about
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
not about full retail sales for the atcs
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about cultivation for
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
sales to the state and manufacturing
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
products yeah and manufacturing
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so and transportation so um i just
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that's what we
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
were talking about here
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
there are a number of risks associated
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
with entering that market one is is will
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
this program even get off the ground due
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
to legal concerns no state has ever
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's hard to evaluate the risk that your
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
market won't even materialize all right
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
before you go left
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
you have a question for
 
01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:10.709 align:start position:0%
you have a question for
uh

01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
identifiers are a system for tracking
 
01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.750 align:start position:0%
identifiers are a system for tracking
marijuana

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
this spill i don't think there's
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the important
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we've never really needed too much
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
of a tracking system in new hampshire
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
because we only have the three companies
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
and we have very strict rules about how
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
we can transport and there's limited uh
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
interactions between them
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
but if we're moving to a
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
robust free market system there would
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
need to be some way to track that
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
product and other states have generally
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh found there are a few software
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
systems that that already exist that
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
seem to work pretty well for that
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
the main caregivers have resisted it
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
because they they would add costs to
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
them so that's one state where there
 
01:28:58.149 --> 01:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
isn't track and trace and there's kind
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
of a wild northeast
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
market in a sense but all the other
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
states pretty much
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
found that to be important and have done
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
that and the commission the commission
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
report four years ago recommended a
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
tracking system
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
assuming a recreational market i'm not
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we evaluate how that
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
fits into our task here but i just
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
is really also a note is what you were
 
01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:34.719 align:start position:0%
just talking about at the end that this
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
is a unique
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
structure that's being proposed here in
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and it's unparalleled
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
canada comes close
 
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.310 align:start position:0%
canada comes close
but

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
there are big differences
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
the law is different uh the federal law
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
is different so it's permitted you don't
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
have this
 
01:29:57.679 --> 01:29:58.550 align:start position:0%
have this
uh

01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
constraint of going across boundaries
 
01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:01.910 align:start position:0%
constraint of going across boundaries
and

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
over over
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
the overhang of possible prosecution of
 
01:30:06.719 --> 01:30:07.830 align:start position:0%
the overhang of possible prosecution of
people

01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
from the federal side
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
and then i think it's been more
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
progressive the canadian law
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
allows for
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
choices whether it will be
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
the province running the retail owning
 
01:30:20.239 --> 01:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
the province running the retail owning
the

01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
retail stores or making them private i
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
think they've had varied experience i've
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
looked at that stuff and i don't really
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
see that
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
it's that helpful in evaluating this
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
because it's so varied and it's
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
again the federal overlay is so
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
different would you come into that yeah
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
like you i looked into canada tried to
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
make some sense of what was happening
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
there i haven't followed it as closely
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
as the united states
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
totally different system they legalized
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
nationally and then left each province
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
to come up with their own
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
system and a couple of provinces uh
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
attempted to implement state-run stores
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
it was confounded by a number of things
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i i don't i agree with you i don't
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
think we can learn anything definitive
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
from that experience i think we can
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
learn more from the other states that
 
01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.510 align:start position:0%
learn more from the other states that
have

01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
preceded us and
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
if you know if the goal is to capture as
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
much of the illicit market and
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
transition it to a regulated market as
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
you need to have
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
accessible stores only having 10 of them
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
is going to limit sales and limit
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
revenue and only having 15 suppliers is
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
going to limit consumer options actually
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
i guess the bill isn't i i misspoke in
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
the hearing last last week that
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
the ten is for for uh
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
the uh fiscal note purposes that's
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
unbounded but but that that's unbounded
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
but they bound the the cultivators to
 
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:44.950 align:start position:0%
but they bound the the cultivators to
15.

01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
15.
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how that works but you
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
know on the bill we
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
limit the cultivators to 15
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
but the number of retails could be
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
whatever number we can handle
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
usually usually that's the free market
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
who's dictating that for both so so i
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
guess just to
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
conclude my little piece here that
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'm left feeling that
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we have to struggle with a
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
totally different model and how that
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
plays in because i think that model is
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
given it's coming to us in this bill we
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
work with it
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
but what does that mean in terms of
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
revenue and
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of unknowns playing out
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
here it's uh
 
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's unprecedented there's no other
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
state that does it this way
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
how does that affect revenues i don't
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
know we've got a liquor commissioner we
 
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.270 align:start position:0%
know we've got a liquor commissioner we
all

01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
think they do a great job with liquor
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
but with liquor they're working off of a
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
supply on top of a wholesale supply
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
system that is worldwide
 
01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.669 align:start position:0%
system that is worldwide
and

01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know if it falters here it's going
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be strong enough there they're going
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
to always have a good supply and they
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
can work on top of that
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
and be clever and they are
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a storable product i don't know
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
whether that makes a difference we
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
haven't talked about marijuana and how
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
it has to be
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
dealt with over
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
periods of time when maybe the market's
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
going up and down um
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
but uh but that's our challenge oh no we
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
got a reaching challenge yeah
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to keep on moving here so
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much man
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
mike can you come up we'll be real quick
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
with you here
 
01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.430 align:start position:0%
with you here
um

01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
why don't you expect why don't you
 
01:33:34.229 --> 01:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
explain your role and then what we
 
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
really want to know is what do you think
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
if we if we were to
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
open up this to
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
the atcs how how does that how do we do
 
01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
the atcs how how does that how do we do
that

01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
and do we have to make them for-profits
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
to do that what what do you think in
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
terms of this let me first explain your
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
role yeah thank you my name is michael
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
holt i'm the administrator for the
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program with the
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
been running the program for a number of
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
years um
 
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.430 align:start position:0%
years um
the

01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
the department has concerns about this
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill and this model obviously i'm
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
concerned about the viability of the
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
atcs under this model and thus if the
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
viability of the atcs is threatened then
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
the viability of the therapeutic
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis program is uh is at risk as
 
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:22.550 align:start position:0%
cannabis program is uh is at risk as
well

01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
um as matt started saying or said you
 
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.030 align:start position:0%
um as matt started saying or said you
know

01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:27.990 align:start position:0%
know
most

01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
states who have a medical and a
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
recreational market have been able to
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
maintain both markets um and there is uh
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
there is value to a medical market um
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
some of the principles that under that
 
01:34:40.639 --> 01:34:41.910 align:start position:0%
some of the principles that under that
that

01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
underpin the value of a medical market
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
available to people under 21.
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
they allow higher potency products than
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
a recreational market does
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
they offer strains and product types
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
oriented to a medical market
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
they provide robust education
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
campaigns to to patients
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
most importantly
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
medical programs don't tax cannabis and
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
recreational product programs do tax
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
if under this model the point is to
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
undercut a regional price and make this
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
a money maker then
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
patients are patients are going to where
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's cheapest they're not going to the
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
place that
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
that requires extra cost they're not
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
talking to their doctors about their use
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
of this for a medical purpose they're
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely going to the cheapest price
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
point um we're see we see this in in
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
maine you know people go across the
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
border to maine because it's an
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
unregulated market we know our patients
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
are going across the border
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
so without a tax a taxable model i'm
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about the viability
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
so what might help the viability of the
 
01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:48.709 align:start position:0%
so what might help the viability of the
atcs

01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
atcs
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
allowing them to enter a record this
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
recreational market so they can at least
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
stay in business and also serve the the
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
the medical market as well
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
um how we do that
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
reinsert senate bill 38 perhaps into
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um and allow a for-profit
 
01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.430 align:start position:0%
this bill um and allow a for-profit
conversion

01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
um as is a possible way of doing that
 
01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.109 align:start position:0%
um as is a possible way of doing that
um

01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
right now you know my
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the issue of edibles or rather we're
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
using edibles as a stand-in for cannabis
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
infused products so there's a whole
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
range of cannabis infused products that
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
are not edibles uh you said topicals
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
topicals are cannabis infused products
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that they're not flour not
 
01:36:29.990 --> 01:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
concentrates so this bill would
 
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
concentrates so this bill would
put

01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
put
 
01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.310 align:start position:0%
put
this

01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
at first it's important to say that this
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill recriminalizes the possession of
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused products for the
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
general population right now they are
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
decriminalized this bill would
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
recriminalize an adult you know uh
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
possessing a cannabis infused product
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
bought by another state
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and so there's fiscal
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
issues related to that you know because
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
now it's it's recriminalized
 
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.590 align:start position:0%
now it's it's recriminalized
um

01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
this bill allows the uh the state stores
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
to sell
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
these cannabis-infused products directly
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
to the therapeutic cannabis patients
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
so if the bill is to not have edibles
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
then allowing these state stores to have
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
edibles to me sounds like another nail
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the coffin for atcs um it's taking
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
away that possibility of the um
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
the atc's to retain some of the market
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um so if the bill doesn't have uh
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow cannabis or cannabis
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
infused product sales at all
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't allow them to sell those
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
products to
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
to atc patients
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
um that's my opinion so i don't know
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
what the number is for the atcs to say
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
how many patients do we need to remain
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
viable we know that if this program gets
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
a significant number of patients will
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
stop going to the atcs stop going to
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
their doctors stop going to get the
 
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
education and um and they're going to go
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
to the cheaper market i don't know what
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
that number of patients is you know that
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
that makes these atc's non-viable
 
01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.709 align:start position:0%
that makes these atc's non-viable
um

01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
we we just don't know um matt didn't say
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
the number we don't we don't know what
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
the number is um but these are these are
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
point these are small points to uh
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
increase the possibility that that
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
remains viable if you're not going to
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
allow edibles and other cannabis infused
 
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
products for the general population
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't allow the state stores to
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
sell it to the medical population
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
so so here's the
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
so this this gets really
 
01:38:36.159 --> 01:38:37.510 align:start position:0%
so this this gets really
sticky

01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
sticky
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
i mean so first they're
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
not for profit the atcs
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh if we say okay
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay there's two two levels of this one
 
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.030 align:start position:0%
okay there's two two levels of this one
is

01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:50.550 align:start position:0%
is
okay

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
you can you can grow
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
do you think they would want to grow
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
and manufacture
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
for the state stores
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
the atcs
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
you were you heard you heard one of the
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
atc's saying that they that they would i
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
believe that it's a possibility if they
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
did it's a way to remain viable i'd be
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that they're like there's way
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
more money over there
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
um in a general in a general you know a
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
more standard uh recreational market
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's way more more money in um in rec
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
than there is in medical and they would
 
01:39:24.310 --> 01:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
just go over there but i don't see a
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
whole lot of money the problem yeah then
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
the problem becomes in the license part
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
i mean the retail part
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
how do we pull that off we're saying we
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
haven't no it's a liquor store we're
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
our retail stores are
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
under the the auspices of our liquor
 
01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.709 align:start position:0%
under the the auspices of our liquor
commission

01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
do we license some have a special
 
01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
do we license some have a special
license

01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
for the atcs to to sell
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
on a recreation side like we had talked
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
about in the commission
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i mean the bill's got to
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
say something right
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know um and i don't know what it is
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
to say yet you know to allow to make
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
that that uh that dual stream work under
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
this model um and i don't know if we're
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to figure it out in the next you
 
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
know we already have for the next you
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
know the next couple weeks probably
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
wrote this out by wednesday or something
 
01:40:14.239 --> 01:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
wrote this out by wednesday or something
so

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know you know i would raise
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
one more concern about the what the bill
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
says right now and that is that
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
if the state stores are to sell to
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
medical patients
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
meaning somebody shows a card
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
that means that the state stores need to
 
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
sell cannabis that complies with current
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
state regulations related to
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh medical marijuana or therapeutic
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis um so what that means that's
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
under the under with no changes this
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
sets up a dual regulatory structure for
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis sold in the stores it's unclear
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
to me whether or not a patient shows up
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
from massachusetts shows their mass card
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
and only wants to buy flour
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
that they have to buy medical flour or
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
can they buy recreational flour but at
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
the very least if they're going to buy
 
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
an edible or cannabis infused product
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
that cannabis infused product from the
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
cultivation from manufacturing
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
needs to comply with our standards the
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program standards
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's a duplication of effort duplication
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
of regulatory structure um it's
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's problematic unless we unless we
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
tease it out so the solution to that is
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
not allow the uh the state stores to
 
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:28.950 align:start position:0%
not allow the uh the state stores to
sell

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
sell
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
medical uh to medical patients
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
the last thing i would say is that uh
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the um the the issue with the the
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
set-aside the 25 million dollar
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
set-aside for hhs um it needs to be
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
iron-clad that it's not diverted to
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
other purposes like we see with the
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
liquor liquor money
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol fund
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
the language needs to be stronger to
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that that money comes to hhs for
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
spending the proper way
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay tim
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
so if i can kind of summarize kind of
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
what you said so i understand
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of removing the medical
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
from the state like a store component
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
from the state the cannabis stores all
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
together does that sound like
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on the bill uh
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
this is the first time the department
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
has ever not been opposed to a cannabis
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
legalization bill um and
 
01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
the only workable model under this would
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
be to remove in my mind would be to
 
01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:30.790 align:start position:0%
be to remove in my mind would be to
remove

01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
remove
 
01:42:33.510 --> 01:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused product sales
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
from the medicine from the state store
 
01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:36.390 align:start position:0%
from the medicine from the state store
follow-up

01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
and the second aspect relative to
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
allowing the parallel licensor of
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
existing atcs to be able to sell
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:42:46.239 --> 01:42:47.189 align:start position:0%
to the state
that

01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:47.199 --> 01:42:48.310 align:start position:0%
that
has

01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
well right i'm sorry cultivators
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and transporters that that
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
currently licensed under
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
licensure to allow parallel licensure of
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
those states we'd have to look into the
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
medical statutes to make sure there's no
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
conflicting language over there
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think allowing them to enter this
 
01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:08.629 align:start position:0%
i think allowing them to enter this
market

01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
increases the chances of their viability
 
01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
and so we would need to explore
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
the ability for them to
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for that market
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay we have
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
let's say we're like oh we have until
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
next wednesday let's say
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
let's assume we're going to vote it out
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
on it so we have some work to do
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
to amend us i'm looking at you tim
 
01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.310 align:start position:0%
to amend us i'm looking at you tim
okay

01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
to see what we can
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
do and i think this is a larger
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
discussion for the full committee on
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
friday as well
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you thank you thank
 
01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.149 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you thank you thank
you

01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:46.159 --> 01:43:47.669 align:start position:0%
you
so

01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would like to say that um all the
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
conversations that we're having in here
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
right now are conversations that have
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
been going on for the past several days
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
independently of us talking to other
 
01:43:57.990 --> 01:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
legislators and us talking to
 
01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
organizations outside of the legislature
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh to to find a pathway for
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh to stop arrest in the state and um i
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
think that what i'm hearing today is
 
01:44:10.790 --> 01:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
that there's there's a reluctance to let
 
01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
the state do it but in the same tense if
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
the state's
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to do it and this is a bill that
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
can make it through then let's let's
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
open a market for the atcs
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
to cultivate for the state and
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
make this a forward-thinking bill
 
01:44:29.669 --> 01:44:29.679 align:start position:0%
i know that everybody talks about
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
privatization in the future you know
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
right now this is not exactly
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
privatization this is the state the
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
state controlling the sale which i have
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
no i don't care who sells it as long as
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
it becomes legal you know i i'm tired of
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
seeing people's lives ruined
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
for for a mistake that they made in
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
public and people are using cannabis
 
01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.550 align:start position:0%
public and people are using cannabis
anyway

01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're using it anyway
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
so um let's let's try to be forward
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
thinking with the bill
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
the last set of conversations here was
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want to harm our atc's so
 
01:45:01.679 --> 01:45:02.470 align:start position:0%
we don't want to harm our atc's so
that's

01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.750 align:start position:0%
that's
okay

01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
i just want to move on to the next item
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
number six
 
01:45:10.229 --> 01:45:10.239 align:start position:0%
um page eight line 23-36 which
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
basically talks about um
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
and page nine lines one through 20
 
01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:16.629 align:start position:0%
and page nine lines one through 20
apparently

01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
so this is talking about the revenue
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
what we do with revenue not necessarily
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
how much revenue we get but strictly
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
what we do with it
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
and i have a couple recommendations for
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
changes changing that to make it a
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
little cleaner because i have to tell
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
you i went to chairman abbas i think
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
three or four times trying to understand
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
how we're spending the money
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
because the language that was in the
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
bill was confusion had confusion to me
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i have a couple an idea i'd like to
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
float by the the members that have
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
conversation points around it
 
01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.149 align:start position:0%
conversation points around it
um

01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:48.159 --> 01:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:51.679 align:start position:0%
one of the first things the bill does is
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
the first spend we do is to pay back
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer for the upfront cost of
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
opening the businesses
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's 14 million dollars in the fiscal
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
note that estimating on 10 stores
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure the liquor commission is
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
not going to try to open 10 stores all
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
at once
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
and that the reality is this is going to
 
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
be a rolling effort um over probably two
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
years um for them to be able to get
 
01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:18.149 align:start position:0%
years um for them to be able to get
there

01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so what my initial thought was again
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
i still want to pay the taxpayer back
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
for the cost based on the
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
the lack of better phrase the profits
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
that come from the sale of cannabis
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and and however i think that the 14
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
million is probably a little aggressive
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
i know fiscal has a problem with that
 
01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.750 align:start position:0%
i know fiscal has a problem with that
number

01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to cut that by to a third of
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
that number but make it a revolving fund
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
so as funds come into the cannabis fund
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
they can reinvest them back to open the
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
next store and then as more money comes
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
in they can reinvest over the next door
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
so rather than try to come up with 14
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars at once we come up with
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
one third of that which is whatever it
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
is four point something three point
 
01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:58.310 align:start position:0%
is four point something three point
something

01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.669 align:start position:0%
something
um

01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
and and roll that into a rolling fund so
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
ultimately they can open up all their
 
01:47:03.679 --> 01:47:04.870 align:start position:0%
ultimately they can open up all their
stores

01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
stores
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
um i keep i'd like to keep the second
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
provision which is
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
after after the uh
 
01:47:11.199 --> 01:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
after after the uh
the

01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
paying back the general public for the
 
01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:16.149 align:start position:0%
paying back the general public for the
loan

01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
loan
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
interest-free loan um that we pay the
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
operational costs
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
and then you end up with a net number
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's left after your startup costs
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
after your operational cost you end up
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
with a net number that's left over which
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
is actually what we can use to help the
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
citizens in new hampshire for
 
01:47:34.629 --> 01:47:34.639 align:start position:0%
for um tax relief and other things
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to suggest is that we
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
put 50 of that net
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
towards this statewide education
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
um and to help reduce that cost
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
on the off chance that 50 percent of
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
that net revenue equals the entire swept
 
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is three point uh 363 million
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
dollars i think uh which means we'd have
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.070 align:start position:0%
to make
um

01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.109 align:start position:0%
um
whatever

01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
whatever that number is over six hundred
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
thousand million dollars in net revenue
 
01:48:04.719 --> 01:48:06.229 align:start position:0%
thousand million dollars in net revenue
um

01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
that any overage that should occur would
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
go to the new hampshire retirement
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
system debt
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
because that's going to directly help
 
01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.229 align:start position:0%
because that's going to directly help
our

01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers and then if the new
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement debt is paid off
 
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
then it would go to the
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so 50
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
if we don't reach the swept then it's
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
irrelevant but if we do reach the full
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
swept amount
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
then the overage first would go to the
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire retirement system if that
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
debt is paid off then it would go to the
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the next stack of
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
number is 30 to the new hampshire
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
retirement system debt
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
as we all know
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
that this is a huge cost to our citizens
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
um the the amount that towns have to pay
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
for their for this debt that's you know
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
i think we have a 25 years left on the
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
buyout if we can accelerate that that's
 
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
only going to help our towns and cities
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
it'll help our employees because once
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
that debt's paid off we can reduce the
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
amount of percentage they have to pay
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
towards retirement which ends up into a
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
pay raise for them basically
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
um so i'd like to see 30 of that go to
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire retirement system to
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
pay off the debt and again once the
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
debts paid off the balance would go to
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
the next would be 10 to the department
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
of health and human services for
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
cessation programs or 25 million dollars
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
whichever is less
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
and again i think at some point we reach
 
01:49:28.870 --> 01:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
a max threshold how many citizens i do
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
have some information i'll forward to
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee i got from
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh the department on cessation programs
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
and funding sources and the amount of
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
money their expenditure they're
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
expending at dhhs but again i think we
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
do 10 of the
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
of the net revenues
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
or 25 million dollars which gives the
 
01:49:47.589 --> 01:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
fund lots of money to be able to help
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
any citizens that are coming for
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
cessation programs
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
the last 10 is broken up in two buckets
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that are already identified in the
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
statute five percent would go to police
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
for training and services uh for
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
training services and then
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
um five percent would go to the
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
children's mental health program to at
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
dhhs to help help kids
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
so that's what i'm proposing as a
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
general this conversation starting point
 
01:50:10.639 --> 01:50:11.510 align:start position:0%
general this conversation starting point
to

01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
amend that all of that language that's
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
talking about how we spend the net
 
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
revenues and amend it to that again 50
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
to swept 30 percent of new hampshire
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
10 or 25 million whichever is less to
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
dhhs for cessation programs
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
um five percent to the children's
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral and five percent to the um
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
police and if i did my math right that
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
equals 100
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.910 --> 01:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
well my first point is that uh this is
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
exactly the kind of proposal that we've
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
got three members of the finance
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee sitting on our
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
larger committee to uh help us think
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
about and
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
i'd look to
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
them for guidance uh i guess as a
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
general matter i i would want not want
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
that that level of detail
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
in a statute
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's going forward that's the kind of
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
thing that should be sorted out
 
01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:13.510 align:start position:0%
thing that should be sorted out
by

01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature and with the help of its
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget process i think
 
01:51:20.239 --> 01:51:21.910 align:start position:0%
as part of the budget process i think
but

01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
there can be room for priorities and
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
certainly in the context of this bill it
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense that there be
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh the kind of priority that's expressed
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the bill right now
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of putting 25 million dollars
 
01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.070 align:start position:0%
in terms of putting 25 million dollars
into

01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
programs that
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:47.910 --> 01:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment of it
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.189 align:start position:0%
and so forth
and

01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
i guess that's what i want to say i i'd
 
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
be very
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
very very careful about
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
being too specific and too
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
long in
 
01:52:05.119 --> 01:52:07.669 align:start position:0%
long in
in

01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
sort of predicting what the needs will
 
01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:10.709 align:start position:0%
sort of predicting what the needs will
be

01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
four years six years out
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
which is what you'd be doing by
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
cementing it in statute
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
i'd favor putting
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
the excess money for example into the
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund period
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
and if that
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
means that over time you can have a
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
reduction in the uh
 
01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.709 align:start position:0%
reduction in the uh
swept

01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
swept
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
so be it but
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
because the education trust fund has
 
01:52:39.189 --> 01:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
been filled up by these other revenues
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
but i i wouldn't uh
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
up front
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
make that
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
that decision regarding a particular tax
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
there are other taxes we could consider
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my initial take on that
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
kind of that kind of proposal and i
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
really look forward
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
we have to have the finance
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
committee members input on that
 
01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:02.790 align:start position:0%
committee members input on that
so

01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
my take on this is
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
first off i i really think you got to
 
01:53:09.669 --> 01:53:09.679 align:start position:0%
confer we have three days of session
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
the three members of finance that are
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
been attached to this committee they all
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it because they're in
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
other hearings right now
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
um that that you confer with them
 
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
because they have their ideas
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
okay so but i think you got to convince
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
them if you convince them
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
that that that go for it
 
01:53:28.159 --> 01:53:29.510 align:start position:0%
that that that go for it
um

01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
the thing though is
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
before you really come with these break
 
01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:33.990 align:start position:0%
before you really come with these break
points

01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.189 align:start position:0%
points
that

01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get to it today we gotta we
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
gotta we gotta start the discussion on
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
how much revenue we really think we're
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to get from this
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
because you know the 25 million may eat
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
up the whole thing
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
whatever you may eat up the whole thing
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
so it may be a smaller pot that's going
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
to be divided up so we've you know what
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i agree that's why i did it
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to have more discussion on
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
this today because it's really i agree
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
with the finance
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
that in terms because i know during the
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
hearing uh i saw heard from some of
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
these guys that said you know
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
they view this as an appropriation
 
01:54:10.639 --> 01:54:11.830 align:start position:0%
they view this as an appropriation
forever

01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
forever
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
and they want to change they want to
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
chime chime in and i think
 
01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
if you could take the lead on that talk
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
with them i have had a couple
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
conversations but i'll continue to have
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
some more okay thank you
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
so let's keep on going
 
01:54:24.719 --> 01:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
so let's keep on going
um

01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting the other banking
 
01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.109 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting the other banking
one

01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
um so if i can mr chair the next the
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
next number seven
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is that we just strike
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
all the banking language right out i
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
think it was clear from the banking
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
industry itself new hampshire bankers
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
association said that these
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
programs are available to atc's into
 
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis related companies to be able to
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
do their financial needs
 
01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then we heard from the banking
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
commission that as the bill's written i
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
think that we were 59 million dollars
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
short in our appropriation of 10 million
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
dollars and then it would require an
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing infusion of cash from the state
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
as deposits increased for the state bank
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
if it was ever to be created so i think
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we should just strike all the
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
banking language okay uh i want to have
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
ryan come up a second uh he he i think
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
he agrees with you
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
and i think we all agree
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh but there's one one thing he'd i
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
think he'd like to see done so
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry okay
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the president of the bank mr
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
chairman you asked for one you get two
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's how this works
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
yes why don't you both uh introduce
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
yourselves and then sure christy merrill
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
president new hampshire bankers
 
01:55:39.119 --> 01:55:40.629 align:start position:0%

association

association
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
and ryan hale vice president uh
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
government relations for new hampshire
 
01:55:48.070 --> 01:55:48.080 align:start position:0%

yes thank you for your comments
 
01:55:51.189 --> 01:55:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
we did want to just raise that in the
 
01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:54.709 align:start position:0%
we did want to just raise that in the
event

01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
event
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes sorry um
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the event the state banking language
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
does come out which we have asked for we
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
do believe there may be some additional
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
language that might be helpful for
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
bankers just to give them some
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
additional protection that
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
that would just help them to get into
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
the space as well so we don't have that
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
for you today
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
but if that's something the group is
 
01:56:15.189 --> 01:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
agreeable to we'd be happy to help
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
01:56:17.599 --> 01:56:19.750 align:start position:0%
provide that
um

01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we'd like to see that
 
01:56:23.589 --> 01:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
you can just send it to me and all that
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'll look at it if i need it like right
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
away but if you can get me that language
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
right away um then i'll try to introdu
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'll try to in my amendment incorporate
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh some protections for the bankers that
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
enter into this
 
01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.030 align:start position:0%
enter into this
market

01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%

we appreciate
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
the banking association coming forward
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
and saying we think we can help you out
 
01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:51.430 align:start position:0%
and saying we think we can help you out
here

01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh it was it was there was a lot of
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
discussion previously on whether or not
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
that could happen
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for stepping up and saying
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
we have we have members who may be able
 
01:57:01.910 --> 01:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you can i ask you a
 
01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
question you know and just a naive
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
question about banking i'm not a banker
 
01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:08.149 align:start position:0%
question about banking i'm not a banker
but

01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
if um
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
obviously marijuana cannabis is illegal
 
01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.790 align:start position:0%
obviously marijuana cannabis is illegal
federally

01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
federally
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
and if all the small bank you have
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
stated that the number of banks stepped
 
01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
up and said they could help us you know
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
as an alternative banking you know um
 
01:57:21.199 --> 01:57:22.550 align:start position:0%
as an alternative banking you know um
source

01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
source
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
how does that work um that a small bank
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
that say it's a small bank right in the
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
middle of the state has no interstate
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
commerce but still has fdic insurance
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
for their customers
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
how does a small bank be able to do that
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the face of a federal you know law
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
against cannabis
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a complicated question but
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
um i would answer that by saying fincen
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
has issued guidance um and as part of
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
that guidance they they explain how
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
banks can get into this space
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know as we've talked about before
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of banks around the
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
country and credit unions in the space
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
and so they they try to follow the
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
guidance and by that guidance it's
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
really laid a path for them to do so and
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
it has to do with um
 
01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
filing the with sars which i'm i'm
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
blanking on what that stands for
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
suspicious activity report thank you
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
um so it it has it determines it's based
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the type of relationship and if it's
 
01:58:20.070 --> 01:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
a direct banking relationship and the
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
level of suspicious activity reports
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
they have to file and things like that
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
so we believe that that helps
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
create a pathway for banks my only
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
reference point was that in a hospital
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
if you do not if you take in medicare
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
patients medicaid patients you are
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
obliged to follow all the federal
 
01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.550 align:start position:0%
obliged to follow all the federal
regulations

01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't it appears that you can
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
get around that in the banking industry
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's still illegal federally as
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
you said so that's a problem um and we
 
01:58:47.109 --> 01:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
believe it needs to be addressed at the
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
federal level you know we've i've
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned this at the hearing but
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
we've been advocating very strongly for
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
years for the safe banking act which
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
would give bankers protection um from
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
from regulators when they are
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
banking cannabis in states where it's
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um going off of
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
that uh do you have any types of
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
reporting or anything that has come out
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
about uh problems that banking has in uh
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
gone through when they've moved into the
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
space that maybe you could share with us
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
are there don't have anything top of
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
mind but i can certainly try to find
 
01:59:25.599 --> 01:59:26.790 align:start position:0%
mind but i can certainly try to find
some

01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
and representative murphy um
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
during the hearing i believe we handed
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
out the vincent guidance i do have a
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
copy if you'd like an extra copy of it
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're all set in the
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
banking thing you'll work with
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
the representative lang thank you that'd
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
be great we got about a half hour left i
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
do want to get to revenues i'm going to
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh um mr chair number on number um
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
eight i do have an edit on page 11 line
 
01:59:59.679 --> 02:00:01.189 align:start position:0%
eight i do have an edit on page 11 line
25

02:00:01.189 --> 02:00:01.199 align:start position:0%
25
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
i would strike where they say additional
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
investigators and change it to market
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
consultants it's just a typo that was a
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
cut and paste kind of problem right so
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
and that should take care of that right
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
they were asking for that delicate
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
commission thank you so what's your word
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
market consultants
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
they have no expertise there in in
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis at all they need somebody that
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
understands how this all works
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
and we should give them that
 
02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:28.310 align:start position:0%
and we should give them that
okay

02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh the number um
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
is everyone okay with that okay
 
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:33.350 align:start position:0%
is everyone okay with that okay
so

02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:00:34.550 --> 02:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
that was that was next round page 12 up
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
around line
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
seven and we're looking at this is where
 
02:00:43.030 --> 02:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
we talked about talking about we've
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
already talked about eleven so keep on
 
02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.030 align:start position:0%
already talked about eleven so keep on
going

02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:48.149 align:start position:0%
going
then

02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
well yeah eleven was coming up with no
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
we have ten first right so we skipped
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
over ten ten is talking about the limits
 
02:00:56.070 --> 02:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
the cultivators and retail stores are
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
unbounded and whether or not we want to
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
change anything and mr chair i just say
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
that i kind of looked us like we did at
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
the sports betting bill well i don't
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
like a limit on cultivators and i'd
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
rather remove it it's all going to be
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
based on roi and return on investment
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the industry will decide how much is
 
02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.589 align:start position:0%
and the industry will decide how much is
needed

02:01:11.589 --> 02:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
needed
 
02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
as you said currently there are only
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
three atc's and if we allow them the
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
right to cultivate manufacture and
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
transport we're still going to need more
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
cultivators manufacturers and
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
transporters beyond that
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
as they may not be able to meet the
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
state need or decide to go in i think
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
this probably is a reasonable limit
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
i'd rather
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
take it out myself but
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
but i'm also willing to treat it like we
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
did our
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
our sports betting where we limited the
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
number of sports betting book locations
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
retail locations on the initial outset
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill to see how it was handled
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then we can make adjustments going
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
forward all right
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
because my big question was
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
is if we don't know how many stores
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be and then but we're
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
not limiting the number of stores
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
but we're limiting the number of of
 
02:01:56.639 --> 02:01:58.790 align:start position:0%
but we're limiting the number of of
cultivators

02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
cultivators
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
right i think i think i think that we
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
need to be uh wary of the fact that if
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
the market grows then
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
as the stores are implemented
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
more product is going to be needed
 
02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.229 align:start position:0%
more product is going to be needed
and

02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
fortunately the atc's are already set up
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
to grow or have the availability to
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
duplicate their process if they in fact
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
know that they're going to have
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
um a market to sell it to
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
um and they're and they're allowed so
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that number i don't i don't know
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
why the number's in there not all
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
cultivation like you know
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
it goes for the stores are we big stores
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
small stores they could be big big
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.070 --> 02:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
they even put a bound on it doesn't make
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
sense whatever the market the market's
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
going to dictate eventually
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
02:02:42.639 --> 02:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
what it is
yeah

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
is there any reason for this number that
 
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.430 align:start position:0%
is there any reason for this number that
uh

02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
those involved in drafting this
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
yeah no my understanding was probably
 
02:02:51.679 --> 02:02:52.629 align:start position:0%
yeah no my understanding was probably
just

02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from the chair oh
 
02:02:54.320 --> 02:03:00.149 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from the chair oh
yep

02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
i won't name any names but
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think we all know the name but that's
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay but the number 15 was not set in
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
stone so if people are concerned that
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
that number is too low
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
i mean if you were going to increase
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
that i would just
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
think conservatively on what you want to
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
do but
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
maybe 20 would be a good number
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think problem is we're throwing a dart
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
right we're guessing right and no matter
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
what number we guess we're going to be
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
way too high or way too low again i go
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
back to sportsbet and we we allocated
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
for 10 retail locations we have four in
 
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
the state and it's been over two years
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
since we legalized sports
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
retail sports betting so i think this is
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
a number we can dynamically adapt as
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
someone can introduce a bill to increase
 
02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
if we're at 100 capacity and we can just
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
adjust the number or remove it all
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
together if that's what we want to do i
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
think it's a good starting point just to
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
respond to that i think the uh
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
the risk is the it does prove to be a
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
set an artificial constraint on
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:12.149 align:start position:0%
on the
supply

02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
supply
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
of this product that's needed
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
for sale and if it turns out that there
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
are a whole bunch of cultivators that
 
02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
want to get in
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that's how
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
how it's going in new hampshire
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have a number in the statute
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's hard to change
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh so uh but if uh it has to be there
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
because it's it's quote the policy
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's come to us so be it uh you know
 
02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not gonna fight that but uh it does
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
seem kind of kind of crazy when we don't
 
02:04:41.510 --> 02:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
really have any
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh understanding of why
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
other than arbitrary stuff and uh sports
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
betting places are really expensive to
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
set up so there was some reason to you
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
know limit that number
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
i understood again i i don't like the
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number but if it's something
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
we need to compromise get it through
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
let's you know we're not going to have
 
02:05:05.669 --> 02:05:05.679 align:start position:0%
stores up until after july of 23 we have
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to introduce new bills if
 
02:05:09.350 --> 02:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
we want to change that number yeah i
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't know i agree let's let's not throw
 
02:05:12.069 --> 02:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
the dart again
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
one dart's enough so we'll keep it at
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
the 10 for now
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
15 sorry 15.
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
so on to the next is
 
02:05:24.069 --> 02:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
is where we were talking about working
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
with finance to come up with the number
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
that they're willing to fund
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that number is going to dictate how
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
fast we are able to open the stores
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
if they don't if they don't want to give
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
us 14 million up front
 
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
they don't want to appropriate 14
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
million for next because this is
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
the problem they got is we said it was
 
02:05:42.639 --> 02:05:44.069 align:start position:0%
the problem they got is we said it was
300

02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
300
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think the surplus of about 300 million
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
and they got well over that already in
 
02:05:50.550 --> 02:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
requests so
 
02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:51.750 align:start position:0%
requests so
they

02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:05:52.639 --> 02:05:55.030 align:start position:0%
you know
it's

02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they they they
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
we've already been told they want a
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
lower number than the 14 million
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
so all that would do is just throw the
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
implementation in terms of the number of
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
stores that we can open and there's
 
02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:05.750 align:start position:0%
stores that we can open and there's
probably

02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
um there's only certain amount of stores
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
we can open at one time anyway so that
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
make that opening may
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
happen over a couple of years anyway so
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
so they'll be looking for an appropriate
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
well and this tim with tim's idea was
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
that well we get the first group of
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
stores open they're generally running
 
02:06:20.159 --> 02:06:21.830 align:start position:0%
stores open they're generally running
revenue

02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
all this other spending to or
 
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:25.480 align:start position:0%
to other
 
02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
organizations or whatever to offset
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
whatever we want to offset it keeps on
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
getting plowed back into opening new
 
02:06:32.239 --> 02:06:33.270 align:start position:0%
getting plowed back into opening new
stores

02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
stores
 
02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:34.310 align:start position:0%
stores
until

02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
using using the actual let's say we open
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
three or four stores initially
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
those stores start generating revenue
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
they make to make a profit in that
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
that that money would be plowed back
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
into opening the next set of stores i
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
think that's your idea tim right okay so
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're talking about
 
02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:52.149 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're talking about
so

02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
and but but we have to get a number out
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
of an official official number out of
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal how much they're willing to
 
02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:58.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal how much they're willing to
appropriate

02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:06:58.960 --> 02:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
appropriate
is

02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
is and i'm getting the vibes from
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
finance that they're not gonna they're
 
02:07:05.910 --> 02:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
not gonna bite on the 14 million for the
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
first year
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
so my question was the liquor commission
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
seemed to be not amenable really to have
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
them physically within their current
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
liquor store is that correct oh that's
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
never going to happen right so if that's
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
the case these are all stand-alone
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
freestanding new buildings which would
 
02:07:22.629 --> 02:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
be substantially more to cost correct oh
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah or storefronts right with the
 
02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:31.830 align:start position:0%
yeah or storefronts right with the
existing

02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah they do that in some of the smaller
 
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be yeah it's probably
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
going to be slow so that they have the
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
gut and this right okay
 
02:07:44.229 --> 02:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
so mr chair i'll work with i'll work
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
with um
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
finance when i'm talking about the other
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
issue um and we'll look at those two
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
ideas of like i said the role the
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
plowing the money back into the grow the
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
stores i think at some point they're
 
02:07:56.550 --> 02:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
going to want to cap on that
 
02:07:58.149 --> 02:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
so we're not doing it for the next 15
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
years and opening up 30 stores and
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
nobody ever gets any money beyond that
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
but we can i'll talk to them about
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
putting again my idea was one-third it
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
allows them to open three or four stores
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
depending on their their model um and
 
02:08:12.310 --> 02:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
then use those three or four stores as a
 
02:08:14.069 --> 02:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
funding source to open up future stores
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine do whatever you can
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
work out with them
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
then my number 12 was just that there
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
was also an appropriation of a hundred
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
for hhs it just just walked out of the
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
they were here a second ago
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
no this is for uh hhs to
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
for preliminary media campaign to
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
be approved for uh for for a media
 
02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
be approved for uh for for a media
campaign

02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
campaign
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
that was before the stores opened up
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill for 150 000
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
and that would be i don't know if that
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
would be your area of hhs abigail was
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
okay all i'm gonna say here is that
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
pretend when you talk to them about the
 
02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
pretend when you talk to them about the
appropriation

02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
i will i'll find out about the 150. okay
 
02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
i will i'll find out about the 150. okay
oh

02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.910 align:start position:0%
oh
yes

02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
that that was in conversation that that
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
150 was put in as part of the amendment
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
the initial request or recommendation
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
was 250 trying to keep the
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note as low as possible
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
was put at 150 but if that number is
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
insufficient to do anything
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
significant perhaps it needs to be
 
02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
significant perhaps it needs to be
reconsidered

02:09:44.550 --> 02:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
my point was that
 
02:09:48.149 --> 02:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
you know in addition to the 14 million
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
requests there was 150 000 i mean
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a big number
 
02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
it's not a big number
um

02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
but when we're talking to finance about
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
it we might as well just wrap all that
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
discussion both of those into one
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
discussion so
 
02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
discussion so
um

02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
okay now we're getting to the big
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.639 --> 02:10:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:10.229 --> 02:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
those they
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
were revised
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
they revised uh fiscal notes
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
oh here it is it's on the top of the
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
pile yeah
 
02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:30.790 align:start position:0%
pile yeah
okay

02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:31.990 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're all just seeing this so bear with
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
us here
 
02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:36.790 align:start position:0%
us here
um

02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we have a whole slew of
 
02:10:45.510 --> 02:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
agencies that
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
collaborated we have the liquor
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
commission the judicial branch
 
02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
judicial council new hampshire
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
association of counties
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
municipal association new hampshire
 
02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
business finance authority
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the department of justice and
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
department of justice safety etc
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
and banking so
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
i think some of these will fall off
 
02:11:05.679 --> 02:11:06.709 align:start position:0%
i think some of these will fall off
because

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:11:06.719 --> 02:11:07.669 align:start position:0%
because
um

02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to remove the
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
banking yeah the first section was
 
02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:18.709 align:start position:0%
banking yeah the first section was
banking

02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.719 --> 02:11:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
banking

02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we even have bothered
 
02:11:26.229 --> 02:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
with those because we are we're not
 
02:11:27.270 --> 02:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
going to be dealing with that i think
 
02:11:29.350 --> 02:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
that's coming off the top so we're on to
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.550 --> 02:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
the bill appropriates 14 uh for uh 14
 
02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:45.109 align:start position:0%
the bill appropriates 14 uh for uh 14
million

02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.119 --> 02:11:46.229 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
10 stores this is very similar to their
 
02:11:48.239 --> 02:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
10 stores this is very similar to their
original

02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:50.830 align:start position:0%
original
you

02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
know just want to see where they came up
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
with this if there's any
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh there's any revenue projections it's
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
just costing projections in here and
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
that that hasn't changed really from the
 
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.030 align:start position:0%
that that hasn't changed really from the
original

02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
so there's no change in that
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm on the show i'm on the chart here uh
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:13.990 --> 02:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
again this is not much more new
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
information than the original fiscal
 
02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:16.310 align:start position:0%
information than the original fiscal
note

02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
where they estimated how much it would
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
but i've not seen anything about revenue
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no right i i haven't thumb through
 
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.910 align:start position:0%
yeah no right i i haven't thumb through
it

02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.350 align:start position:0%
it
uh

02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
they don't talk about revenues anyway
 
02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't help us
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes all right well
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
they're their
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
original their original note to us
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and she's okay it was
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
the person who dismembered the sheet
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
that was hanging out
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
so i spoke to her this morning is the
 
02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.470 align:start position:0%
so i spoke to her this morning is the
the

02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal officer from the liquor
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
commission she's going to join us on
 
02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
commission she's going to join us on
friday

02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
friday
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
she'll be with
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
the person who did this original note is
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to join us on friday she'll walk
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
us through how she did this
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay she couldn't come today
 
02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
okay she couldn't come today
so

02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:19.270 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
but if i took her
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
she did it on a
 
02:13:23.119 --> 02:13:25.350 align:start position:0%
she did it on a
average

02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
average
 
02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:26.950 align:start position:0%
average
net

02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
net
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
basically average net profit
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
and but but that includes edibles by the
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
way in it right she started with an
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
average per capita cost of 35.54 cents
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
per person
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
based on our um based on all the other
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
per capitas they they estimated coming
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
out with a total sales revenue of
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
two point four five point two million
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
dollars in sales which nets out to
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh forty nine million forty three
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
thousand fourteen dollars in net revenue
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
um from that we would have to take our
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
operational expenses um and the payback
 
02:14:02.079 --> 02:14:03.189 align:start position:0%
operational expenses um and the payback
um

02:14:03.189 --> 02:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we know that and mr chair i guess if
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
i look at your again going back to your
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
your flow conversation here
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
talking about flow hubs numbers um we'd
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
be looking at about assuming all that
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
those numbers are right but we take out
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
edibles and we take out cartridges
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
um our net are we're looking at a 56
 
02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:24.830 align:start position:0%
um our net are we're looking at a 56
percent

02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
number um so it would because edibles
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
are 18 cartridges are 26 44 of sales so
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking at cutting our sales
 
02:14:37.109 --> 02:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
basically by 44
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
by limiting those factors
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
and so we're still looking at a again as
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
i said 56 which is over 25 million
 
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
dollars in revenue
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know what i did with my
 
02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:57.990 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know what i did with my
huh

02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
huh
 
02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
huh
uh

02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
i from the from the study that we did
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
from the the marijuana commission study
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
that we did the commission that we had
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
our midpoint was around 50 million
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
that included edibles
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
full bore
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
and the range was seven percent retail
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
tax to 15
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it rains but if you took the midpoint
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
it wasn't i i can't well
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
i did it just by percentages we looked
 
02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
at again using this flow saying is that
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
the the liquor commission
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
came up with a similar number yeah to 50
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
million so again we're looking at 25
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars roughly a little more in
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
revenue to the state
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
that we would use to
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
pay for the program and to offset help
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
our citizens that's mr chairman is there
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
is there any reference to our
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and their net
 
02:15:52.239 --> 02:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and their net
revenues

02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
they're different models but i mean
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
did do we have any breakdown for that or
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
well then the the third the third
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
i'll get to the answer that but then
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's a third um
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
dick dick said i can't find anything
 
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:10.229 align:start position:0%
dick dick said i can't find anything
here

02:16:10.229 --> 02:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it was the one on the prior bill
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
last year's bill there was a there was a
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
237

02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
i think the biggest problem is that that
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
contemplated a full-blown privatization
 
02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
retail right market which isn't what
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
we're doing so it's a little bit apple
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
orange conversation actually that that
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note was a lot lower now why
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
don't why can't i find it here in this
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
pile of stuff
 
02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:40.230 align:start position:0%
pile of stuff
um

02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
from the one that you gave me this
 
02:16:41.439 --> 02:16:46.870 align:start position:0%
from the one that you gave me this
morning

02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
i thought we handed that out but maybe
 
02:16:48.399 --> 02:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
i thought we handed that out but maybe
not

02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
no it's lower this is
 
02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're both having problems here with all
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
it was a bill
 
02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
that was retained last year
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
that was full commercialization
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
legalization of full commercialization
 
02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
and we had the represent me
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative alame sent to all of us
 
02:17:17.359 --> 02:17:18.150 align:start position:0%
representative alame sent to all of us
the

02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:17:22.309 --> 02:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
237. i have it here
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
so mr chair are you looking at the 481
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
um fiscal note which had
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
so it's the 481 the one that it's a
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
quick fiscal note on 481 that's not it
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's still this is this is 230 yeah
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is house bill 237.
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
well this is this is from your i believe
 
02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is the one that had the study
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
committee that ultimate this was the
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that was assigned to it and
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
assumptions no this isn't from that
 
02:18:12.319 --> 02:18:14.549 align:start position:0%
assumptions no this isn't from that
it's

02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
this is for 41 yes this is 41.
 
02:18:18.639 --> 02:18:21.110 align:start position:0%
this is for 41 yes this is 41.
and

02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:23.830 align:start position:0%
 
41

02:18:23.830 --> 02:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
the range
 
02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:27.990 align:start position:0%
the range
was

02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
19. we'll call it 20 million to 31
 
02:18:30.479 --> 02:18:32.469 align:start position:0%
19. we'll call it 20 million to 31
million

02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
but all i'm going to say on this
 
02:18:34.319 --> 02:18:35.429 align:start position:0%
but all i'm going to say on this
this

02:18:35.429 --> 02:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
this methodology looked awfully familiar
 
02:18:41.349 --> 02:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
and it's and it does say it is the same
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
methodology we used
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission report it's the new
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
york city new york state methodology
 
02:18:51.910 --> 02:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they use because
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
and this was done by department of
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
revenue and they just took that and they
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
put more new numbers in it
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
so because it had tourism factoring a
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
lot that was
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
and it's based on the number of ounces
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
per person per year
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then times
 
02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:12.150 align:start position:0%
and then times
uh

02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
an estimate of the number of users
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
this was like 131
 
02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:18.389 align:start position:0%
this was like 131
500

02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
500
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
people who would consume this
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
which is kind of consistent with
 
02:19:23.519 --> 02:19:24.709 align:start position:0%
which is kind of consistent with
with

02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know if we did a percentage on the
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
population that i mentioned earlier
 
02:19:31.030 --> 02:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's about 15 of the population
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
would would be using
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
go to any any retail store
 
02:19:36.240 --> 02:19:37.910 align:start position:0%
go to any any retail store
so

02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.230 align:start position:0%
so
and

02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't say here what they use
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
for a rate but
 
02:19:44.399 --> 02:19:46.549 align:start position:0%
for a rate but
uh

02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:46.559 --> 02:19:47.509 align:start position:0%
uh
what

02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
oh i see what they did they calculated
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
and then they used something a rate a
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
tax rate
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
every ounce should be taxed at 30 an
 
02:19:58.720 --> 02:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
every ounce should be taxed at 30 an
ounce

02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
ounce
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
was there
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
that it looks like it would be taxed at
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level the grower level
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that that's how they did it
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
so this is very low
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
19 to 20 million to 31 million
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
but that's what was yeah it would be
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay if i asked uh mr simon a question
 
02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know matt because of your
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
prime now if you can talk to past
 
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
history or not but do you do you uh
 
02:20:28.630 --> 02:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
understand the percentages of sales that
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
were done on the
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
um other than flower market
 
02:20:36.790 --> 02:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
from from surrounding states
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we would kind of like look at look at
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
that'd be helpful that would be very
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
what what is non-flower usage as opposed
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
to flower usage
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if you can we would
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:05.670 align:start position:0%
yeah um
representatives

02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
where did you get your
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
numbers from
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
and what are they
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
what i did is i looked at the fiscal
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
note for hb 237
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
which is similar to hp 481 the
 
02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
difference is if rather than just have a
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
thirty dollar tax the wholesale level it
 
02:21:32.870 --> 02:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
was a five percent transfer tax and a
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
nine percent sales tax
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
but i looked at the gross sales
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
into hb 237 on the high end was 340
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
million with considering the legal
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
market that's just the gross sales the
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
lower end was uh i don't have the fiscal
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
number frontier but it's about 150
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
million on there was a lower end
 
02:21:53.270 --> 02:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:21:57.670 --> 02:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
it was about a 200 000 difference so
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
what i did was i looked at the gross
 
02:22:02.389 --> 02:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
sales and i kind of at first i was
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
considering what is the markup from the
 
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
wholesale level to retail
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and from what i understood with the
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
flower and i've
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
had this conversation with several
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
different individuals in the industry it
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
does vary
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh some say 80 some say 90 some say 120
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
it really depends on how much they're
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
selling what the strain is there's a lot
 
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
of things to take into consideration so
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
i kind of just used the 80 markup as
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh a tax of which i considered 14 so
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where my numbers came
 
02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:34.070 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where my numbers came
from

02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
another analysis way of looking at it
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
would be if you charge what is the
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
profit margin at the retail sale
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
in my understanding that the general
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
goal is around 50
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
as a profit margin
 
02:22:48.389 --> 02:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
again if you're selling in large volumes
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
that it's nothing wrong with that being
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
around 40 percent it really depends on
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
the volume
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
so if the gross but what i what stuck
 
02:22:56.309 --> 02:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
out to me was
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
it also had the illegal market sales and
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the high end was 311 million dollars
 
02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:03.190 align:start position:0%
on the high end was 311 million dollars
so

02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
whether you have a private retail model
 
02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:06.630 align:start position:0%
whether you have a private retail model
or

02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
what what hp 1598 proposes
 
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's a significant market share just
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
being lost now
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
in those gross sales figures there's
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
nothing distinguishing between
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured products and flour
 
02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:21.990 align:start position:0%
manufactured products and flour
so

02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
i couldn't decipher how exact i would
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
just say if it's about a 30 market share
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
you would have to reduce the gross sales
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
by 30 would be in this again we're
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
ballparking it
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
was your gross sale
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
just marijuana or did it include the
 
02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:39.990 align:start position:0%
just marijuana or did it include the
edibles

02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.270 --> 02:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
well the different models i know what
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
for 237
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
it would have allowed full recreation
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
use of edible products or manufactured
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
products so the number i used in
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
converting that
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
when i talked about the markup i stayed
 
02:23:54.550 --> 02:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
with just the flower which has the
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
lowest markup trying to keep the numbers
 
02:23:58.469 --> 02:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
as conservative as possible
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
the markup on the manufactured products
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
from what i understand is much higher
 
02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
but the 340 million
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
was that just the flower
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
no that that because that came that
 
02:24:11.910 --> 02:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
would include edible sales everything
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
yes that's a gross number right that's
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
the that's the sales yes that's just the
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
gross commercial what was your what was
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
your net after all it's said and done
 
02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
what was your net
 
02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
what was your net
if

02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the profit if
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
because we're trying to find out what
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
the product is in this model it's about
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
the profits that are going to be made by
 
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
the uh cannabis
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh stores that are going to be
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
as profits so we're trying that's what
 
02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to get at
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
so if the markup on the flower is
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
let's just say 80
 
02:24:46.870 --> 02:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the gross sales
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
and you instead of looking at it from a
 
02:24:49.910 --> 02:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
tax perspective you look at the market
 
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.030 align:start position:0%
tax perspective you look at the market
perspective

02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
i was coming my numbers are coming in at
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
is this is now gross revenue share of
 
02:24:57.510 --> 02:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
around 250 million dollars
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
but that's also not taken in taking into
 
02:25:03.190 --> 02:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
consideration the out-of-state consumer
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
for liquor
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
for any given year we're between 40 and
 
02:25:06.399 --> 02:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
for any given year we're between 40 and
50

02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
50
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
where hb 237 was right around two
 
02:25:10.399 --> 02:25:11.349 align:start position:0%
where hb 237 was right around two
percent

02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:25:11.359 --> 02:25:12.710 align:start position:0%
percent
so

02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
that i'm not factoring the odyssey
 
02:25:14.399 --> 02:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
that i'm not factoring the odyssey
market

02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
market
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
being i was kind of thinking
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
ballpark that would be around 20 to 30
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
percent i don't think that's unrealistic
 
02:25:22.319 --> 02:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
percent i don't think that's unrealistic
considering

02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
considering
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
especially in southern new hampshire a
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
lot of the market and economy there is
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
fueled by
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
out-of-state consumers okay so back up
 
02:25:30.309 --> 02:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
so forget about the out-of-state for a
 
02:25:33.750 --> 02:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
minute so okay so we have the so you're
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
saying that gross is what gross is three
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
something or is it the 250
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
i think the gross revenue
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
would be around 250 million dollars not
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration the out of
 
02:25:45.750 --> 02:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
state consumer okay i'm talking about
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
purely retail sales so that 250 then
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying from that 250 gross a
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
profit will be x and then that will
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
leave us with a net right
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
if you if you back out what you think
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
the profit's going to be or
 
02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
what the costs are of
 
02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
what the costs are of
of

02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
the other problem we have
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get what the profit's
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
the gross sales 340 million that
 
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
included the edibles
 
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:17.750 align:start position:0%
included the edibles
correct

02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:18.550 align:start position:0%
correct
and

02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
if you took the edibles out
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.479 --> 02:26:27.429 align:start position:0%
 
million

02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:26:27.439 --> 02:26:28.630 align:start position:0%
million
yes

02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
and now you can use your 80 on that
 
02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:32.870 align:start position:0%
and now you can use your 80 on that
right

02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes you could and and so that your high
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
would be 80 of 170 million which would
 
02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
would be 80 of 170 million which would
be

02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
i trust the math is correct i didn't
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
break it down but all right so we're
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
rather than operating from the 340.
 
02:26:57.680 --> 02:26:58.630 align:start position:0%
rather than operating from the 340.
right

02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay but i have trouble saying that uh
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
are we saying that
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
that the profits are
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
on marijuana stores are 80 margins
 
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
no i what i was saying that that is the
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
market from retail to wholesale i mean
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
sorry from wholesale to retail
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
going back that's where my my numbers
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
initially came from
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
but i i think
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
if you focus on what the profit margin
 
02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:22.790 align:start position:0%
if you focus on what the profit margin
is

02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
is
and

02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why i would hope that
 
02:27:28.710 --> 02:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
at some point we allow
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
full manufacturing product let's do it
 
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
this way so we don't can we just to make
 
02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:33.910 align:start position:0%
this way so we don't can we just to make
sure

02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
between now and friday is there any way
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
you could just kind of sketch that out
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:27:40.230 --> 02:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
let's say we started here we went then
 
02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
we did this and then we did that it'd be
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
very helpful
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
to know i can make a flowchart uh
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
showing the math yeah that would be
 
02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
again i did
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
i still think
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
ignoring the potential out of state
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
market would be
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
you could do a chart with it and without
 
02:27:56.720 --> 02:27:58.070 align:start position:0%
you could do a chart with it and without
it

02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know what i mean in one of the
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
rationales if you notice the quantity
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
limit one can purchase is higher than
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
hp 237 and hb
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
41. and the reason why
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
it was drawn or written that way was to
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
factor in out-of-state sales as well
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
did you say hp 41
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
hb 41
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
when it was as amended by the ways and
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
means committee last term in hb 237 they
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
went to criminal justice and public
 
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
safety committee this term are almost
 
02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:31.110 align:start position:0%
safety committee this term are almost
identical

02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
but you see we're trying to get out here
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know we're trying to understand what
 
02:28:35.429 --> 02:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
we think
 
02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
we think that's going to be
 
02:28:37.359 --> 02:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
we think that's going to be
um

02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
so any other
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions on that okay
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:44.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
and again we're gonna have okay so we're
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
kind of running out of time here today
 
02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.910 align:start position:0%
kind of running out of time here today
um

02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
i think we got some actions that we uh
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
jim i think you've got some you got the
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
list can i run through them real quick
 
02:29:01.830 --> 02:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so you know um
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh where do i start so we're gonna fix
 
02:29:06.150 --> 02:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
the regulation licensure and
 
02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
registration in the admin in the admin
 
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.070 align:start position:0%
registration in the admin in the admin
rules

02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:14.710 --> 02:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
look at what language changes are needed
 
02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
to allow the atcs to sell to the state
 
02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna look at the revenue split
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
and talk to finance about that and see
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
if the split that i i talked up works
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk to finance and see
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
what the dollar amount is to the state
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
to do us the startup costs and what
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
their what finances can find palatable
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
and how to make that work
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
i'm going to change that language about
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
market consultant from investigators
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to strike the banking
 
02:29:39.990 --> 02:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
language and i think that was pretty
 
02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.030 align:start position:0%
language and i think that was pretty
much

02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
everything we had
 
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:43.670 align:start position:0%
everything we had
um

02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
within reason
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
we decided to leave the number of
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
cultivators change that number and ask
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
finance about 150 000 to dhhs
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um but the big question is
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
allowing the atcs to sell to the state
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the break the makeup of the model
 
02:30:03.990 --> 02:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
how do we adjust that and adopt that
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'll reach out to someone over at dhhs
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
and see if i can get an answer
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then again
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
if the revenue is only 50 million we
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
still haven't agreed on a number yet
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's only 50 million
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
that cascading of
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
how the revenue gets spent
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe altered don't you think
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
well it's one of the reasons why for
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
dhhs i put a percentage and now i put a
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
percentage not to exceed a dollar amount
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
was because as the industry grows the
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
revenue to dhhs will grow to deal with
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
the possible increase in demand
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
and so you know by doing a fixed number
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
of 25 million
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
was problematic because again if
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
depending what that number is that we
 
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
have come in that could eat up 100 of
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
all the revenues and nobody gets
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything else we still got other
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
problems to solve
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
or potential problems itself
 
02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay i want to ask representative major
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay can we just pull out calendars here
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
a second to see
 
02:31:00.080 --> 02:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
a second to see
um

02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
do you think we're going to exact this
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
on next wednesday
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you why because
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
we have to have it on that whatever it's
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
next wednesday by noon right in order to
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
make the calendar for the following week
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
which is crossover
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
so wednesday at noon we have we'd have
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
to have it exact by so we can get it
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
over to the clerk
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
so mr chair how do we want to how do we
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
want to handle this because
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
we we
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
can we're gonna have a work session on
 
02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:44.710 align:start position:0%
can we're gonna have a work session on
this

02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:31:47.349 --> 02:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
um hopefully you know we'll bring all of
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
that that'll be good can we also
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
schedule one for tuesday in case we need
 
02:32:02.479 --> 02:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
schedule one for tuesday in case we need
it

02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
