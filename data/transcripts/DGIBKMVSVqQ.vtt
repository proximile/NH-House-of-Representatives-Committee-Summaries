00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts uh uh taxation of
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
their income i earned in this state
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure of i'm happy to look
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
back uh through our records i didn't
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
check before i came in this morning and
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
see if we got notice of anyone
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
challenging it i can certainly supply in
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
my along with my written testimony the
 
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
my along with my written testimony the
uh

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question if we have
 
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:04.300 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up sir
 
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.670 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up sir
[Music]

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
lacking any specific law
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
how can a new hampshire resident
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
rely upon
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
the general con the
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation by the irs that the
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
taxation only takes place
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the state where the work took place
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
if there's no law in new hampshire
 
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.629 align:start position:0%
if there's no law in new hampshire
stating

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
stating
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
that it's the state's interest
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
then the state
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
can't support
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
an individual in their private lawsuit
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
so if a law like this or with certain
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple of language changes that
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
dra may recommend
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
would not then you as a litigator
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
have a stronger case
 
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court maybe you get your
 
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.710 align:start position:0%
in the supreme court maybe you get your
quill

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
arguing this by saying it's the
 
00:16:01.749 --> 00:16:01.759 align:start position:0%
law of new hampshire it's the practice
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and this law
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
does nothing more than supplement
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
what the irs has already said
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
is their regulation
 
00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:12.150 align:start position:0%
is their regulation
um

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
so a couple responses
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
to that and i do appreciate the question
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
because i think it's getting a a a
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
pretty important
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
point at least in my mind um
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
the first is i i would have to go turn
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
back to the irs guidance and see
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
specifically what it says
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
my recollection but i i don't want to be
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
held to this is that it still may leave
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
open the question about what it
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
means to perform work within the state
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
whether having your employer there and
 
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.350 align:start position:0%
whether having your employer there and
having

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
your work product transmitted there
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
having payroll there is sufficient
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
connection or being physically present
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
is required and i need to i would need
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
to go um see whether the irs guidance
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
speaks to that question um i do think um
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
and this is getting back to the to the
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
first question
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
um from today that if the if the
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislature were to speak on this issue
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
i think it would certainly um
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
confirm uh what i think we we tried to
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
powerfully explain to the supreme court
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
which is that new hampshire does have a
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
sovereign interest in this we have no
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
idea why the supreme court declined to
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
hear our case either maybe they
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that maybe a few justices
 
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.750 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that maybe a few justices
did

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
maybe they disagreed that this was you
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
know sufficiently
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
meritorious to to warrant uh
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
review i don't know i hope not i think
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
our i found arguments compelling and i
 
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
hope the justices did too um what i can
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
say is that even a law like this though
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
will not um
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
will not counter or or at least wouldn't
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
um foreclose a state like massachusetts
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
from making what its central argument
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
was um which may have been a persuasive
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
one uh which is there is a path for
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers individually to challenge this
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they can challenge it all the way up
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court and in fact the
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
case is coming out of new york there
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
were petitions for rid of certiorari
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
there that the supreme court ultimately
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
denied and and that was massachusetts
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
central argument all the time which is
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
you can come through our system and you
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
can go to the supreme court and the
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire's
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
role in this isn't essential and the
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
supreme court shouldn't allow new
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire to use its uh
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
kind of this extraordinary relief
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
through a petition for original
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction directly in the supreme
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
court um i don't know whether that
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
argument persuaded the justices i do
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
know that that was really the main
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
argument that massachusetts made to
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
counter our petition and um and while a
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
law like this may bolster us in the
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
future saying
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does have an interest it's
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
an independent interest from its
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it is an essential sovereign
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
interest um i suspect the argument we
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
get in response is the exact same one we
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
we received this time
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to the chair to ask if we
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
can get the
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
either the irs guidance itself or an
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
analysis of it uh as the uh as mr uh
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
garland does his work
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
next is representative alame followed by
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative jaquesian and then i'd
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
like to have the dre
 
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
like to have the dre
respond

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
have you talked with the other states
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
that few states that do not have an
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
income tax
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
to see if we could possibly get them to
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
join in the next time and
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh would that help to get scotus to do
 
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
uh would that help to get scotus to do
it

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
so before um
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
or while we were preparing uh the
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
petition this time i i can't remember
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
the specific timing but there is a
 
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.390 align:start position:0%
the specific timing but there is a
process

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
under which you seek amicus support for
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
your position um it goes through the
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
national association of attorneys
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
general which i believe almost every
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
state is a member of
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
we got i think
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
i want to say maybe 13 states that came
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
in to support us one way or the other um
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
a handful of states that have been
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
affected by policies uh like the one we
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
were challenging so new jersey in
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
particular came in on that position i
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
believe connecticut did too because it
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
has an interest with how new york is
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
taxing um we got a handful of states
 
00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
that came in uh taking a position that
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
they often do which is that the us
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
supreme court's original jurisdiction is
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory it doesn't have the discretion
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
to to decline to hear a case we
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
obviously weren't persuasive in that
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
regard um at least this time around um i
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
i can't recall whether other states came
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
in without income taxes i do remember
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
part of the analysis that
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we we did back at the time when we
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
were bringing this lawsuit is that new
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire is awfully unique
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
with respect to the uh the volume of
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
workers from southern new hampshire that
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
do work in massachusetts and that many
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
of the other income tax states may not
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
have had that geographic um similarity
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so i can double check to see whether
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
any of the amica support was from states
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
without income taxes but we certainly
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
did reach out to every state every other
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
state in the country and did get a fair
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
isn't montana one of the
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
income no income tax states i'm trying
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
to remember
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
i know uh let me see it's oregon no it's
 
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.950 align:start position:0%
i know uh let me see it's oregon no it's
what

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
washington that depends on the i can
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
never remember which of them does anyway
 
00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:15.350 align:start position:0%
never remember which of them does anyway
uh

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
with the remote
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
access growing and a lot of
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
forest fires and other problems out
 
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.669 align:start position:0%
forest fires and other problems out
there

00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
i should imagine that there are
 
00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.350 align:start position:0%
i should imagine that there are
uh

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
there is a growing number of people in
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
those states also that
 
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.590 align:start position:0%
those states also that
that

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
are working remotely with a place that
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
is an income tax state
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
try and talk to them directly
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
so i i can never i get the
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
income and sales tax states confused and
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
so i can never off the top of my head
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
remember which are which either um
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
i i i i would i should say so i i think
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
one one of the arguments we certainly
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
put into one of our filings that may
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
have been our reply brief um
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
this trend to toward remote work like i
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
said before isn't going to change it's
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
going to we we anticipate it's going to
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
continue in that direction going forward
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
and at that point which again was you
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
know the better part of a year ago um
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
we were
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
we had uh you know examples of major
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
companies saying they may remain remote
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
work companies going forward or at least
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
keep policies in place where more
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
employees could
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
work remotely
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
and so i do believe that this is an
 
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.310 align:start position:0%
and so i do believe that this is an
issue

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
that isn't going to go away i think the
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
issue has changed with respect to new
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire at least in the short term
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that i do hope the supreme
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
court takes it's really a question of
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
the vehicle and also a question i think
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
of i've been sharing that new hampshire
 
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.029 align:start position:0%
of i've been sharing that new hampshire
taxpayers

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't believe that they have a
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
protection that maybe the supreme court
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
says they don't i mean we would
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
vigorously argue that our
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
our position was correct and it should
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
be the the law of the land but um as we
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
know from prior experience that hasn't
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
always worked and so uh and so that's
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
the risk that i that i see in this
 
00:23:01.039 --> 00:23:03.830 align:start position:0%
the risk that i that i see in this
legislation

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
followed by repton and schamberg
 
00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:09.669 align:start position:0%
followed by repton and schamberg
and

00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.549 align:start position:0%
and
aaron

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
coming in absolutely and talking to us
 
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.750 align:start position:0%
coming in absolutely and talking to us
um

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.789 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's it it sounds like and there's a
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
great probability that this could come
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
back up again
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
um i mean i
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
am very strong in the
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
thought process that we want to be
 
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.710 align:start position:0%
thought process that we want to be
proactive

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
i personally don't want to wait until
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
the next thing happens and then we have
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
to scramble to do something i think
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
the time to protect new hampshire
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
residents is now
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
i guess my question to you would be you
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
know maybe this isn't the perfect
 
00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:48.870 align:start position:0%
know maybe this isn't the perfect
language

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
do you have a suggestion
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
on how we could
 
00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
tighten it up and make it potentially
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
better in case you do have to go to the
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
supreme court again
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
um yeah i guess i'll start with that um
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
so that was something that was actually
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
a question i anticipated um i i
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
received notice of this bill uh last
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
week i know it's been pending for for um
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
a month now um and so we haven't had a
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
time chance internally to have the
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
conversation of what that language might
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
may look like but i'm certainly
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
more than happy to go back to the doj
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i think we would be willing
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
participants in trying to craft language
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
um that has the effect that that
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
addresses the concern that that you're
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
identifying which is if this issue comes
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
up again kind of bolstering the state's
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
position if and when we go to the
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
supreme court in a way that may
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the concerns i've
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
expressed today so if that's um
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
something that the committee would would
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
like us to look into i'm happy to bring
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
that back and i believe having spoken
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general there's
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm on our part to play a role in
 
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.110 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm on our part to play a role in
that

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
we certainly would be happy to have you
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative schambard
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
taking my question
absolutely

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
i will have two questions so i'll have a
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
could you tell us what the convenience
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
i can try my best to explain it bill
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
artinger would be the right person to
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
explain that in detail um
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
as i understand that the the the name is
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
actually a bit of a misnomer it's the
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
idea that if uh if an employee is
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
working remotely in a different state um
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
as a matter of convenience as rather
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
than as a matter of necessity um at
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
least as far as new york is concerned
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
that new york can continue to tax um
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the income of that employee and so
 
00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
if someone's working in new jersey
 
00:25:33.279 --> 00:25:34.230 align:start position:0%
if someone's working in new jersey
because

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.190 align:start position:0%
because
uh

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
because the company thinks it's better
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
for them to be there or the or the
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
person desires to not have to commute
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
into new york city that that would
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
really i think be on the side of the
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
convenience of the employer doctor and
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
whereas if you if you have to work from
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
home um maybe due to an accommodation
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
for a disability um other circumstances
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
that may be on the other side of it so
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm certainly willing to try to find
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
a better explanation than that but
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's really where the convenience
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
comes in it's really not a matter of
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
necessity that sounded good follow-up
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up the the second part of this is
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
when an employee does an employee have a
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
contract formed in massachusetts
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
when they sign on with a company in
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and must they follow that
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
contract which might say you will pay
 
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.269 align:start position:0%
contract which might say you will pay
your

00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:22.310 align:start position:0%
your
taxes

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
that are required to massachusetts
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
i i suspect that the the uh
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
the employment relationship may vary on
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
whether someone's a contract employee
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
whether someone's an at will employee
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
and really what the terms of the
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
agreement look like
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
i do think an argument
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't see the argument but i could
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate an argument being made that
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
if you form a contract in massachusetts
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
to work for a massachusetts company
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's a sufficient connection with the
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
state to be subject to that state's
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
taxes i haven't seen that specific
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
argument but i could foresee that coming
 
00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
argument but i could foresee that coming
up

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
what i can say is that the businesses
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
that that we um
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
spoke to about this issue in the context
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the supreme court um appeal they
 
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.350 align:start position:0%
of the supreme court um appeal they
didn't

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
at least to us weren't taking one side
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
or the other it was really just a
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
question of of uh making sure it was
 
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
administratively feasible to to do this
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
so they didn't want a situation where a
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
bunch of employees were subject to
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
certain rules that that other people
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
weren't and you can understand that from
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
a business perspective that it's
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
different from the legal perspective of
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
course thank you very much
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
and representative aaron
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative schomburg pretty much
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
asked my question because i i know
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
people who
 
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.789 align:start position:0%
people who
uh

00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
work remotely
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
for companies that are in
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
another state
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
and but their status is of co as is that
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
they are contractors as opposed to
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
some other status of employee
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
and i was just wondering you know how
 
00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
and i was just wondering you know how
that

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
how that would uh you know make a
 
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.029 align:start position:0%
how that would uh you know make a
difference

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the law and this law
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh i think employee status can make a
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
significant difference it's going to be
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
one of um
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
one of my frustrating answers i think
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
that it is really going to depend on the
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
terms of the employment and the state's
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
law that um that is that is seeking to
 
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
tax you i mean the challenge we have
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
with taxation laws is that you have a
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
federal jurisdiction you have you know
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
51-ish state jurisdictions plus you have
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of different local
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and so you know i think
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
when we were working on it in the
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
wayfarer context we're seeing upwards of
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
10 000 different
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
potential taxing authorities it may be
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
different in the context of income
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
but the laws can vary from place to
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
place and it's very hard to
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
if not you know certainly beyond maybe
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
my skill level to understand
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
specifically on a granular level what
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
every taxing authority is doing but i
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
think you're hitting on a pretty vital
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
point which is not only is this a
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
complicated question of constitutional
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
law a position that a question that we
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
think we have a very good argument under
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
but in terms of how it affects
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
individual new hampshire residents or
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
individual employees it is going to be a
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
question that turns on where they're
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
working in the terms of their in their
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
terms of their uh relationship with the
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
employer where that employer um
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
where that employer resides and so it is
 
00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:09.909 align:start position:0%
where that employer resides and so it is
a

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
as with all things taxation there is no
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
clear answer let me put it that way
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative nunes
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
being here for us today and and this is
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
kind of a comment kind of a question i i
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
don't know where it's exactly where it's
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to go i'm one of those people
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
that for 25 years i worked in another
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
state i air commuted back and forth
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
there were times when we
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
questioned whether or not we were going
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
to be taxed in another state
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
and uh we got a clarification now this
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
is several years ago and i don't know if
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
this is still in tax code for the irs
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
now but we were given clarification from
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
our employer that if we spent more than
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
50 percent of our working time in that
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
state then we would be taxed in that
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.269 align:start position:0%
state then we would be taxed in that
state

00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
but if the contract was considered that
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
we would work remote whenever
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon by the the client and
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
the employ our employer
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
then we would not be taxed for working
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
in that state and there were many there
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
are many uh instances where
 
00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:14.870 align:start position:0%
are many uh instances where
we

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
we worked only remote and we were never
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
taxed in that state and that's when when
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
these instances came up in new york and
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i tried to pay attention
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
i've been retired for several years now
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm not up on the irs codes but i did
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
implement payroll systems in 40 states
 
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm very interested in where this
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
is going to go
 
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.310 align:start position:0%
is going to go
and

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i think that i think it was
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative ames that said we may
 
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:39.919 align:start position:0%
want to look at the irs tax code what
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
the current code is now because that may
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
give a reflection as to what the rest of
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
the states are doing and how they're how
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
they're behaving towards this i was a
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
little shocked when massachusetts came
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
up with this i know why they did but um
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
but uh you know because of all the
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
crossover into their state it was a very
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
controversial move so if you can talk to
 
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
that any at all i don't know if you need
 
00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.549 align:start position:0%
that any at all i don't know if you need
to

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:02.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
i can make a couple of brief comments
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
and respect in response to that um the
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
the first uh thing that you hit on was
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
this idea of of more than 50 percent of
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
time um within estate subject attacks um
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
and as i understand it that's one of
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
at least three different ways states
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
have gone about doing this
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
whether you spend the majority of the
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
time there or the on the flip side kind
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
of a convenience of the employer that's
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
where your employer lives and so or
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
where your employer resides and so it
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter where you're doing
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
work and then massachusetts's rule the
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
rule that was in effect before the
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
emergency rule and as i understand it
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
the rule that's gone back into effect is
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
effect as effectively a um a days in
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
days out sort of um rule so that if if
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
you're working three of your five days
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
within massachusetts your subject income
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
tax on those three days and so really
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's a physical presence when you're
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
there um and what other states are doing
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
i really can't speak to that right now
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
but i do suspect you're going to find at
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
least those three examples and and maybe
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
upwards of you know
 
00:31:57.669 --> 00:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
many more i don't even want to put a
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
number on it um
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
and it is where that's where it gets
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
awfully complicated i think it in
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
particular for you know for businesses
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
that are trying to um
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
to make payroll decisions that because
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
it could vary very much based on where
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
their employers are and and uh we've
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
certainly heard that in the sales tax
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
context and that's really what we were
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
hearing from businesses in the context
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
of this issue too that they they wanted
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
just have an answer to the question it
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
was really that from a business
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
standpoint that seemed to be the greater
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
interest than any particular legal
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
position but it does add another layer
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
of complication to the issue
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
representation yearly has a follow up
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
yeah to add another layer
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
as you put it
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
football players when they travel from
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
state to state
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
particularly california new york and
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts are subject to paying that
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
state's tax
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
for an afternoon's work
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
that's not anywhere near the 50 percent
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
of their work time
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
it's a temporary job and yet they're
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
still paying a state sales tax so i i
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
think that's an area that needs
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
added to this
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
rule that we're looking at thank you sir
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for bringing that up uh
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
representing newman
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to have
 
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.110 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to have
ken

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
ken
 
00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.789 align:start position:0%
ken
representing

00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up it's sounding
 
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.549 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up it's sounding
like

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
if on
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
a town
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
on one side of a county in colorado
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
decides to tax this a different way than
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of colorado
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
that also gets entered into the equation
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
we i remember we were talking about the
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
extreme difficulty of figuring things
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
out in colorado
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
the one thing i don't know the answer to
 
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.470 align:start position:0%
the one thing i don't know the answer to
um

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
with respect to that question is whether
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
um the extent to which localities may
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
have separate income tax rules uh in the
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
way that they do sales tax rules i i
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
simply don't know um we focused it on it
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
from a state level of course um
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
i do believe at least there are some
 
00:34:07.029 --> 00:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
large cities that have separate income
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
taxes but i'm actually not a 100 sure of
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
that but yes to the extent there are
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
localities that are that are
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
adding an additional layer of potential
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
taxation here that that does make the
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
question more complicated
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative murphy uh thank you mr
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your uh
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just to follow up to uh
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative zanigan's concept of a
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
pre-emptive strike having a
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislative um
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
law in place to
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
argue for the supreme court in general
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
does the supreme court or anybody
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
involved in tax law
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
have a hierarchy of authority meaning
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
does the federal versus a state versus
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
the local tax
 
00:34:48.399 --> 00:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
the local tax
laws

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
preempt other ones or have authority of
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
the other in general
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and so from a
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
specific tax concept um i i don't know
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
the answer and i'm certainly happy to
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
try to find it what i can say though is
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking federal law um
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
under the supremacy clause preempts
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
state law and as a there's a version of
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
state supremacy over local law as well
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's i understand a little more
 
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.069 align:start position:0%
that's i understand a little more
complicated

00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
what i can also say is as far as the us
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
supreme court is concerned um
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
it usually isn't taking up cases dealing
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
with individual taxpayers and resolving
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
tax conflicts what it's much more
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is questions of you know
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
significant open questions of
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional law and the open
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
questions here are significant it's it's
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether a state can even do this um
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
under the due process clause of the 14th
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and under the commerce clause
 
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.589 align:start position:0%
amendment and under the commerce clause
um

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the sort of question that we
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
presented to the u.s supreme court um i
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
think it would be much harder to
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
convince the supreme court to take a
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
case that was really based on an
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
interpretation of just new hampshire law
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
that those are not the sorts of cases
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that the court is typically taking
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
and in some instances their cases the
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
supreme court said it won't resolve that
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
basically that's left to the state
 
00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
basically that's left to the state
system

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
um the department does not have a
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
position uh is not taking a position on
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
this bill at this current time
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
as as you know
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
there is no personal income tax
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
but the department is concerned with the
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
language as it currently stands on the
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
um on the proposed bill
 
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.630 align:start position:0%
um on the proposed bill
the

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
um so one of the items would be the the
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
statement to say that no no state has
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
the power so that's on line five
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh no state has the power to
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
tax earned income sorry tax value earned
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
outside of its borders
 
00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.349 align:start position:0%
outside of its borders
um

00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
so that harkens back to the uh the
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation from the supreme court in
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
terms of the due process and the
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
commerce clause um the federal
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
of the u.s constitution
 
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
um but in addition to that as some of
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
the representatives have mentioned here
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh it also
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
um this is not the the um the complete
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
um ruling uh it also interferes with the
 
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.349 align:start position:0%
um ruling uh it also interferes with the
um

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
with the with the
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
application towards business taxation as
 
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.829 align:start position:0%
application towards business taxation as
administered

00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
administered
 
00:37:51.839 --> 00:37:52.950 align:start position:0%
administered
by

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.710 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
especially

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
specifically for business taxes
 
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.430 align:start position:0%
specifically for business taxes
where

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
there is this concept of unitary
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
unitary business
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
combined reporting
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
so where
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
there is this concept of the transfer of
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
value so a value could be earned in one
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
state but there's also a transfer of ex
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
or exchange in value between states
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
where uh one business organization may
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
be conducting business activities in
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
more than one state
 
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:31.270 align:start position:0%
more than one state
so

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
this this ve we we feel that this
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
current language of
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
not having the power to tax value earned
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
outside of its borders
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
if this value is transferred to another
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
state so let's say transferred to new
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire or from new hampshire transfer
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
to another state so the the concept of
 
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.310 align:start position:0%
to another state so the the concept of
unitary

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
unitary
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
businesses which is
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
currently recognized
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court uh might be
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
challenged might be might be maybe a
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
challenging concept for us to
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
to continue to administer the um
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
the apportionment of income to to new
 
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.230 align:start position:0%
the apportionment of income to to new
hampshire

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.349 align:start position:0%
hampshire
um

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:10.069 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
those are one of the uh the concerns
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
that we would have uh with this current
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
language and the dra
 
00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.230 align:start position:0%
language and the dra
is

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
is willing to work with with the
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
representatives and with the attorney
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
general's office in terms of trying to
 
00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to to proceed we would
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
definitely want to be involved and try
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
to help to
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
provide our
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
input into this
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:40.069 align:start position:0%
from the committee
representative

kane could
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
could you uh work out
 
00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.310 align:start position:0%
could you uh work out
uh

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
some specifics on each of the ones that
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
could distort the way we do our taxes
 
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
could distort the way we do our taxes
now

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
and give us
 
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
an example or a couple of examples
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
of hypotheticals
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
of how it would have to change
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
sure yeah we can work on that thank you
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:40:11.839 --> 00:40:13.670 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
jeanine

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
jeanine
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is more just
 
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is more just
a

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
a comment um i'm pleased to hear that
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
that you would work with the
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to craft
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
something that makes sense i think
 
00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
something that makes sense i think
um

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.589 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
immediacy of this while there's no
 
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
immediacy right this second we don't
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
know when it could come up i think again
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
being proactive is
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
is good and um
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that okay
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative romney there's a question
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
for the chair for a comment
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
it appears that we're at a crossroads
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
here in terms of
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
of do we first off do we do we want to
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
fix this
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
at least hold some water to defend
 
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.750 align:start position:0%
at least hold some water to defend
against

00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
any possible attack from from other
 
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
any possible attack from from other
states

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
thus maybe going to the supreme court
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
again so i think i think i think we
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
should have two votes on this a straw
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
poll maybe not maybe now but maybe we
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
meet next week
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
as before we we asked the ag and the
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
department of revenue to work on this i
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
think we want to have a sense if the
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee wants that to happen first
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that we know they don't waste their
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
time that's all that's my comment on it
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
but i i probably would support them
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
working on it but uh but i think the the
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee should weigh in if they if
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's what we want if no sense in
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
having them do the work
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
and then us voting no
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
although there may be some value mr
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair because
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh as they go through because and these
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
things when it goes when it comes to
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing as we learned when we
 
00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
were working on wayfair
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
every word counts every word counts
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
and uh hopefully we can craft something
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
that you know will
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
hold the weight
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
of a potential challenge thank you
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
the idea of a straw poll to determine
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
which direction we even want to go
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful today
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
so for example
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think that we're
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
constructively in the zone of tweaking
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
this language
 
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh an example would be
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
if uh keane has suggested that value
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
earned is maybe too vague a term to work
 
00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.349 align:start position:0%
earned is maybe too vague a term to work
with

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
you could literally drop the phrase
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
value earned outside of its borders
 
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.109 align:start position:0%
value earned outside of its borders
therefore

00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
so that it just goes straightforwardly
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
no state has the power to tax income
 
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.069 align:start position:0%
no state has the power to tax income
earned

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
earned
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
you could even interject the word
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
personally earned to distinguish it from
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
business tags
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
you could do these things
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
the problem though is
 
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.550 align:start position:0%
the problem though is
that's

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
sorting out the words
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
of this particular
 
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.589 align:start position:0%
of this particular
draft

00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't get us where we want to go
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
because this draft
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
essentially is declaring to another
 
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.069 align:start position:0%
essentially is declaring to another
state

00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
you can't tax our residents
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
and we have no power
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
to back that up and enforce it
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
so the real question going back to our
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
discussion with mr garland
 
00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:23.430 align:start position:0%
discussion with mr garland
is

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
from the ag's perspective
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
is there anything that we could do
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
instead of being directed to the bad boy
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
other state
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
is there something we could do that's
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
directed to the united states supreme
 
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.790 align:start position:0%
directed to the united states supreme
court

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
or directed to the attorney general
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
that sets the stage
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
for them to be successful if this rears
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
its head again
 
00:43:48.079 --> 00:43:49.270 align:start position:0%
its head again
and

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
that there is anything we could say that
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
would influence the supreme court
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
but but if if there's even a chance of
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
that it's probably simply
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
a statement
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
that it is the sovereign interest and
 
00:44:07.589 --> 00:44:07.599 align:start position:0%
the tax policy of the state of new
 
00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
the tax policy of the state of new
hampshire

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
not to tax
 
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
not to tax
its

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.589 align:start position:0%
its
residents

00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
residents
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
on income personally earned
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
that any tax any any action taken by
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
other state
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
assert attacks over its residents
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
undermines the tax policy of the state
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
gives standing to the state
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
for the attorney general to assert its
 
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.470 align:start position:0%
for the attorney general to assert its
claims

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
claims
now

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
frankly i don't know whether that would
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
actually mean anything to the supreme
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
court but it's the only thing i can see
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
can conceive of that would make it worth
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
having a bill
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
that would raise a lot of other
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
different questions
 
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:53.990 align:start position:0%
different questions
and

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
and
issues

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
it just
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
further complicates the whole thing oh
 
00:44:58.319 --> 00:45:00.630 align:start position:0%
further complicates the whole thing oh
yeah

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
represent ames
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm glad we have a number of lawyers
 
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.270 align:start position:0%
i'm glad we have a number of lawyers
here

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
and probably for every lawyer who wants
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
to speak on this issue you get a
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
different opinion
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
and none of us know what the supreme
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
court will do
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
welcome representative spillsbury's
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
comment i
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
my own view is that
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
there needs to be something that is as
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
significant in the sense of a
 
00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.430 align:start position:0%
significant in the sense of a
controversy

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
controversy
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
for the supreme court to take up an
 
00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:40.630 align:start position:0%
for the supreme court to take up an
issue

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's got to be something that's
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's got to be resolved and as an
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
assertion by the state
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
just a an assertion
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
without more without a context like that
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'll
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
we'll gain the attention of a supreme
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
court that's already too busy and we
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't waste our time in that beyond
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
that i think a lot of work needs to be
 
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:05.829 align:start position:0%
that i think a lot of work needs to be
done

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:05.839 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
to identify the discrete issue
 
00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:10.790 align:start position:0%
to identify the discrete issue
that

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about that doesn't
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh interfere with our tax policy that's
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
been in place for a very long time
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
particularly with the business taxes
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my comment
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
it almost seems like if we want to go
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
forward with anything on this bill
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work to do
 
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.069 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work to do
and

00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
be a candidate for interim study if we
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative yearly
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think your analysis on that is correct
 
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.589 align:start position:0%
i think your analysis on that is correct
but

00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
i but following up on what uh attorney
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
garland had suggested
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
there and it's the same article the same
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
problem we had with wayfair
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
we need to get a definitive answer the
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
entity giving the definitive answer is
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
going to be scotus
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be a mechanism
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
to get to scotus
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
and just like
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
the commerce clause came into existence
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
between new york taxi new jersey
 
00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:15.670 align:start position:0%
between new york taxi new jersey
then

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think this is a vehicle i thought
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
wayfarer was a vehicle too but we kind
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
of sidestepped that
 
00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.510 align:start position:0%
of sidestepped that
um

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.190 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
but let's uh
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
come up with some language to go in to
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
study with and ask the two agencies to
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
come up with language that protects our
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
interests as well
 
00:47:43.119 --> 00:47:44.230 align:start position:0%
interests as well
but

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
to get something that triggers original
 
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.910 align:start position:0%
to get something that triggers original
jurisdiction

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
should be the goal i would think and i
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
think that should be the direction to
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
rather than aaron
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
while i
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate the notion of interim study i
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
would be against that
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
simply because i think that we need to
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
craft something now
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
to protect the
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
workers in our state
 
00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.150 align:start position:0%
workers in our state
and

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
my thought is i'm not a lawyer
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
but i know that people who are working
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
remotely are not using the
 
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
remotely are not using the
infrastructure

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
that their tax
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
would pay for
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
they're not traveling into this other
 
00:48:33.599 --> 00:48:34.549 align:start position:0%
they're not traveling into this other
state

00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're not using any of the
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
amenities of the other state
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
and on top of that
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's taxation without representation
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
they have no say in how their money is
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
being used
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
and i think those are constitutional
 
00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:50.390 align:start position:0%
and i think those are constitutional
issues

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.150 align:start position:0%
issues
so

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's important i think to protect
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
the the money that these people are
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
making uh for the work that they're
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
doing whether
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know that they're doing at their
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
home or
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
away from
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
their the other state
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i just think the sooner that we do
 
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.349 align:start position:0%
and i just think the sooner that we do
something

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to protect these
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
employees the better
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
any further comments uh representative
 
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
any further comments uh representative
elmi

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
elmi
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
if on
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
if that company did not exist in the
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
other state that person would not have a
 
00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:32.069 align:start position:0%
other state that person would not have a
job

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.319 --> 00:49:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
interim study is really the way to go
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
and to leave it to the ag's office and
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
to try to maneuver the shoals of this
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
and see if there's something we can do
 
00:49:50.559 --> 00:49:51.430 align:start position:0%
and see if there's something we can do
to

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.630 align:start position:0%
to
to

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
shore up
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
a future challenge if it comes and i'm
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's not going to come this
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
any further comments and representation
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
followed by representative nunes thank
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i i
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
i understand the sentiment for interim
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
study um but i would be against interim
 
00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.270 align:start position:0%
study um but i would be against interim
study

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
um i think we're just pushing it off
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
um i i think
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
that working
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
letting the ag's office and dra work on
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
some language
 
00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.549 align:start position:0%
some language
that

00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
would help in a potential future supreme
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
court case
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think is is advisable in my opinion i
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
think we need to go that route because
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
putting it off i think the the truth of
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
the matter is we're not going to
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
do enough work to make sure that
 
00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:48.549 align:start position:0%
do enough work to make sure that
um

00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
we are prepared we don't know when this
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
is going to happen we can lull ourselves
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
to sleep and think that you know
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen for another
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
year or whenever but i'm i feel like we
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
want to be prepared
 
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.030 align:start position:0%
want to be prepared
um

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
working on this i think makes sense
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
and so i would um i would push that we
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
we have dra and the attorney general's
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
office craft some language that could
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
work i mean on the on the flip side of
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
this i don't know how good a comparison
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is but
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
new massachusetts residents who come up
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire and work at a new
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire company
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
we all know massachusetts says okay
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
pay the complete tax owed to us that
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is charging the complete
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
tax they have laws that require that
 
00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:32.559 align:start position:0%
their residents who work in new
 
00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire or any other state that
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a tax pay the tax i don't
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
see why
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
the reverse of that where you're a new
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire resident you're working in new
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire okay you work for a mass
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
company fine but we're gonna
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
make the assertions that this bill
 
00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
proposes and certainly i agree that the
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
language could be tightened up
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative ames makes a good point
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
we don't want to inadvertently create a
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
situation where it's affecting
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
our business tax collections um and the
 
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.710 align:start position:0%
our business tax collections um and the
um

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
the prorations based on what state
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
that's earned in so
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i with that i think we should um we
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
should continue working on this and
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see an amendment uh proposed
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:19.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
um we've identified a few gray areas in
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
this bill in our discussion here today
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
and particularly uh the attorney
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
general's office in dra who have been
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
very kind to let us know their thoughts
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
we did uncover in our discussions with
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
you things that needed to be looked at i
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
think that we actually need to look at
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
the irs code and find out what the irs
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
code says and that may give us some
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
standing as to where we could move
 
00:52:49.119 --> 00:52:50.790 align:start position:0%
standing as to where we could move
forward

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
and particularly
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
while there is not an issue right now
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
there is a historical issue because it
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
just happened
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
through the emergency order from
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts our residents got taxed on
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
their payroll and even though that went
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
away it still happened so we do have a
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
standing issue
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's just not currently in effect so
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
i think that i think that because of
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
those gray areas we deserve to look at
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
this just a little bit more before we
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
make a determination whether or not this
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
goes into is
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
representing you early i thank you mr
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
chair that was a good summation i would
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
request the chair
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
in this uh discussion
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
we have a little horse in the selectmen
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
bureau and when we beat it enough we
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
knock it over
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
but i would also urge the agencies to
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
understand that new hampshire has often
 
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.950 align:start position:0%
understand that new hampshire has often
been

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:47.990 align:start position:0%
been
a

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
precedent center at the supreme court on
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
a variety of different things and this
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
could be one that would deal with both
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
the 10th amendment and
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce clause regarding
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
taxation across state borders and
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying those
 
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.349 align:start position:0%
clarifying those
the

00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
per umbra of
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
tax laws that kind of etch into
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
the residents of both of all states
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh through the tax code so thank you for
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
this and thank you for setting up the
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
meetings coming forward
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion on this
 
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.630 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion on this
bill

00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.430 align:start position:0%
bill
and

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
different opinions
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
and we're going to continue this at a
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
work session next thursday and we'll
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
make a decision at that point in time in
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
the meantime
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
if the attorney general and the dra
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
would provide
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
information that
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
they've been asked to provide that would
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to us
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
and if you could provide that
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
information prior to the meeting so that
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
we have time to go over it that would be
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
even more helpful
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to close the work session
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:13.270 align:start position:0%
on house bill
1097.

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the rate of the business
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
profits tax in the business enterprise
 
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:33.430 align:start position:0%
profits tax in the business enterprise

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and what information does the committee
 
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.190 align:start position:0%
and what information does the committee
need

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.829 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair i don't i don't understand how
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
dri came up with their fiscal note of
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
indeterminable if they use a static
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
analysis they can give us a static
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
figure granted they cannot give us an
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
active figure based upon
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
potential stimulation of
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
business but they could
 
00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:10.549 align:start position:0%
business but they could
correlate

00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
what happened when we reduced it the
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
last time
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
as to what an additional reduction would
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
take place
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative brian uh just respond to
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
that uh i think there is they give us a
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
static analysis on the second and third
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's quite extensive
 
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.309 align:start position:0%
it's quite extensive
okay

00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they make some assumptions and
 
00:56:42.559 --> 00:56:43.510 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they make some assumptions and
then

00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
give us a sense of the amounts
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
they break it down to bppt and but they
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
didn't yeah but what they didn't talk
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
about is what the relationship was i
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
didn't see or didn't i don't understand
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
the relationship couldn't possibly be
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
the latter uh between what happened when
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
we reduced it the last time and we had a
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
growth of in revenue when it was
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:12.319 --> 00:57:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.470 align:start position:0%
i
confused

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh representation
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to respond to that we have
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
to remember our taxes lag by three years
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
we have to remember we've made all kinds
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
of other changes in our taxes we have to
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
remember that the general economy of the
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
nation and the huge stimulus payments
 
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
and other things that have affected our
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
taxes over the years
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
factor in strongly to what the actual
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
revenues come out as i've been trying to
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
work with chris shea on
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.270 align:start position:0%
looking at
the

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
presumed impact even of the tax cuts
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
starting in 15
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
all the way through
 
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.829 align:start position:0%
all the way through
26

00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
26
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
and he's having enormous difficulty
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
doing that because of all of the
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
different things that have changed
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes multiple changes in rates
 
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
taking things back putting things in
 
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.789 align:start position:0%
taking things back putting things in
uh

00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:20.069 align:start position:0%
uh
that

00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:20.079 --> 00:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
got factored into the new fiscal notes
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
as they did it in a new environment for
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
robin early what's the hourly rate to
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
forget it
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
we could probably get a remy and they
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
would give us a a number that we would
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
all disagree with
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
okay i think this is one
 
00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:56.950 align:start position:0%
okay i think this is one
that

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
some of you will say
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
and then there's
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
others that say
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
let's wait until
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
we see
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh the result of all the other tax cuts
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
in play now
 
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.109 align:start position:0%
in play now
and

00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
i don't represent
 
00:59:19.119 --> 00:59:20.309 align:start position:0%
i don't represent
lying

00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
lying
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair well i love this bill
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i am concerned about i'm going to use
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
the the term fake money all the stimulus
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
money that's been dumped into the
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
economy that we actually have no impact
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
on how our economy is going to settle
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
out when we're all done
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
i mean when we add more variables into
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
that when we look at the pre the tax
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
cuts we've done in hb2
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
um just this last year and how that's
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
going to settle out as well
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
i i do think again i hate as a
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
republican to say this i do think that
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
um this is ill-advised at this time that
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
we we probably should hold off and see
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
how things set up my biggest concern is
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
the stimulus like i call fake money all
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the money that got dumped into the
 
00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:00.630 align:start position:0%
the money that got dumped into the
economy

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
that ultimately we're going to pay in
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
taxes or some somewhere else
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
but we don't know what the real impact
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
of all that money was in the state and
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
how that's going to inflate impact our
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
businesses when next year that money's
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
not around and we don't have it and and
 
01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:15.589 align:start position:0%
not around and we don't have it and and
so

01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
at best i'd be an interim study on this
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
bill um because i think that again we
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
just don't know the long-term impact of
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
what you know the last two years of
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
dumping fake money into the economy is
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
going to have on the new hampshire
 
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.069 align:start position:0%
going to have on the new hampshire
economy

01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
that mirrors
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
my concern too
 
01:00:38.319 --> 01:00:40.309 align:start position:0%
my concern too
because

01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
we have all this extra money
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
the surplus statement says that we have
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
like 275 million dollars excess
 
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.109 align:start position:0%
like 275 million dollars excess
money

01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
for this last fiscal year
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
but it really is not
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
there as excess
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
because we have some liabilities against
 
01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
because we have some liabilities against
that

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
we changed our ppp
 
01:01:06.319 --> 01:01:08.829 align:start position:0%
we changed our ppp
taxes

01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh and that came about as house bill 2
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
according to the dra they probably
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
collected about 100 million dollars that
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.599 --> 01:01:22.829 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
have all these
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
ppp uh we have all these stimulus
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
packages as representative lang says
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
they haven't settled down and
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
and how much of the excess revenues that
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
credit carryovers that have exploded
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
they went from the
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
low 100s to close to 300 million dollars
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
if you just take the credit carry over
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
and the ppp
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
that would throw us almost 100 million
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in deficit rather than 275
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
million so i i agree that we have to be
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
very careful on this and
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
personally i would say this one needs to
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
go to independent interim study
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative me
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just like to add to
 
01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.710 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just like to add to
that

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
that on we have radically changed our
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
business tax the business profits tax
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
which is our most important tax at state
 
01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:31.990 align:start position:0%
which is our most important tax at state
level

01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:32.789 align:start position:0%
level
and

01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
on we have absolutely no idea what
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to do
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
it was producing
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh we did dra did analyses on i think it
 
01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh we did dra did analyses on i think it
was

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
16 and 17 or
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh the revenues from 16 and 17.
 
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.910 align:start position:0%
uh the revenues from 16 and 17.
and

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.109 align:start position:0%
and
they

01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
maybe the two years before that as well
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
what would have happened if we'd used
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
sales only
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
to as the allocation for uh
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
business the business profits tax
 
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.510 align:start position:0%
business the business profits tax
on

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
and we were we were doing a little
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
better a little worse a little worse
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
by average but we were only talking
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
about a couple of million and then in
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
2018 numbers when they did that last
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
year it was 72 million we would have
 
01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.549 align:start position:0%
year it was 72 million we would have
lost

01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
lost
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
we have no idea
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
whether that would continue
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
if it did we would already have made a
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
major a massive tax cut mostly for
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and mostly for the largest
 
01:03:41.839 --> 01:03:43.029 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and mostly for the largest
companies

01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
and quite a few of them are going to end
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
up with no tax
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that we would get it
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
back from
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and others that are
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
selling into our state but we don't
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
consume as much as other states we're
 
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.670 align:start position:0%
consume as much as other states we're
old

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.430 align:start position:0%
old
so

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
and we export things
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
to other states before they go to retail
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't count
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'm all set i just wanted to point out
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
that we have made a massive change
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
to that and we have no idea what it's
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to look like and we'll start to
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
find out next year
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay so on house bill 1221 anybody else
 
01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.549 align:start position:0%
okay so on house bill 1221 anybody else
representative

01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll
 
01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
echo my sentiment from last time i think
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
the bill as a whole i i agree with you
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
and others who are concerned that we
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't know the full impact of all the
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
tax cuts we've made so
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
this this bill has presented um it would
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
be it would be tough to go along with
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
this not knowing what that revenue is
 
01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
however i'll propose what i said last
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
time i i would
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
i'm really struggling with the idea of
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
potentially having an amendment here
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
that looks at the bpt only that lowers
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the bpt from 7.6 to 7.5
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch the bet leaves it as is
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
in that regard based on these estimates
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
we're looking at eight million dollar
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenue to the state
 
01:05:17.119 --> 01:05:18.309 align:start position:0%
reduction in revenue to the state
however

01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
i i firmly believe that when
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
businesses are looking to come to this
 
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
businesses are looking to come to this
state

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
or compare with other states the bpt is
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
the top line tax they're looking at
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
they're not looking at bet
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
many of them may not even be aware of it
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
but bpt
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
is highly visible and i think one to 7.5
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
makes sense it would require an
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
amendment here that
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
obviously changes his bill to just the
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
7.5 bpt so
 
01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.470 align:start position:0%
7.5 bpt so
um

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
that would be my
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
position i would like to bring an
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that does that
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
unless no one else agrees with it then
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%

serving

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
serving
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
they also do receive health care and
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
child care services if they do need that
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
for serving full time
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
and then one of the most important
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
benefits that they get from serving as
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
well is the sagal education award
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
so that is used to pay off existing
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
student loans if they have them but it
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
can also be used to pay off future
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
schooling so
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
not just college but also vocational
 
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.870 align:start position:0%
not just college but also vocational
schooling

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
schooling
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
um serving as an americorps member you
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
also get exposure to a network of
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of alumni across
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
and excuse me across the country
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
we have a portfolio of seven
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
full-time programs
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and within those programs there are
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
approximately 270
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
positions that are supported with
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
federal americorps dollars
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
those dollars are also matched by the
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
organizations that have those programs
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
so it's a perfect example of
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
public and private partnerships
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
these programs that we have in this
 
01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.350 align:start position:0%

all across the state
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
and the focuses on these programs range
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
from education to
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%

they have all of these members that have
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
these education awards to use and

they're motivated and they're community
 
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
leaders and they want to go to school so
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%

vocational programs as well
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
both employers and then these schools

would have access to hundreds of
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh i think one of the things that we're
 
01:17:46.149 --> 01:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
after and maybe the representative has
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
has the information now but
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
how much uncommitted money is left in
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
the arpa funds that could be used for
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
this fund if it was started
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if i defer to
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm for that
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman can i get a
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
clarification uh from
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
from the two of you um you you talked
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
about the students and that this would
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
be tied to the social emotional learning
 
01:18:26.239 --> 01:18:27.990 align:start position:0%
be tied to the social emotional learning
programs

01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
or did i miss miss here
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes that that i was referring to our
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
city year americorps program
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
and those members not only work on
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
traditional school work but also help
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
with social emotional through
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
mentoring the youth and after school
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
programming and also during during the
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
school day they help them get to school
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
they check in with them they work with
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
them in small groups things like that
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions ask
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative scheinberg thank you mr
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
chairman i'll ask the question
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
establishment of this
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:08.310 align:start position:0%
 
why

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
is it needed
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
so this fund is specifically to attract
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
and retain alumni members um and to to
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
bring back uh or to to keep folks who've
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
served in americorps and i believe peace
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
corps and other national service
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
programs to keep them engaged in
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
employment and
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to representative
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
schoenberg's question
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
how do they do that
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
now so right now they received the
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
siegel education award um and they can
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
take that and use it at any university
 
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.510 align:start position:0%
take that and use it at any university
or

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
institution of higher education across
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
the country so right now we are seeing a
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
lot of loss of
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
folks that are coming in and serving and
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
then leaving
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i can ask andrea if you want to
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it's this is really to help
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
in not only to attract and retain um you
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
know these individuals to stay in new
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire and go to college here and
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
invest in our
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
education system
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
but also to be part of our workforce um
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of folks are coming from
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
out of state so why not give incentives
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
to try to keep them here through
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
bonuses through employers or
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
you know matching through education
 
01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.669 align:start position:0%
you know matching through education
awards

01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
awards
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
i would just add um the data that we uh
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
we're looking at yesterday that is
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the 2000 uh 2021 year um
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
out of a hundred thousand dollars that
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
were spent on ed awards that were given
 
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
americorps members only 4 500 were
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
invested in new hampshire schools all of
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
the rest was utilized out of state and
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that if we were to be
 
01:21:28.390 --> 01:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
able to offer some small match to those
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
at awards that it would incentivize not
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
only new hampshire
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
alumni in using them using their awards
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire but it would also
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
draw folks from across the country to
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
our institutions of higher education
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
so follow up and
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
how do you envision then
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
if money is put into this fund how does
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
access happen to that fund
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be accessed as matched to
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
those siegel education awards to
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education in new
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so there's a already an
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
existing program
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools of national
 
01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:08.470 align:start position:0%
new hampshire schools of national
service

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
service
where

01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
where schools in new hampshire can offer
 
01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:13.110 align:start position:0%
where schools in new hampshire can offer
to

01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
some some match to that education award
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it could be a partial match to a full
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
match but just an additional incentive
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
to draw national service alumni to their
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
schools and so this would augment that
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
you know pose as as further incentive to
 
01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:29.910 align:start position:0%
you know pose as as further incentive to
keep

01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
folks here
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire to
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
pursue their education and also to draw
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
folks from across the country thank you
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
one further
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
and what typically how much are those
 
01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.830 align:start position:0%
and what typically how much are those
awards

01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
awards
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
for an individual
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so if an individual finishes a
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
full-time service which is approximately
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 months or a year
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
they would get an education award of
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 6
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
429 dollars
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%

01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire in american rescue plan act
 
01:24:34.639 --> 01:24:35.669 align:start position:0%
hampshire in american rescue plan act
funding

01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
so it's less less than half has been
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
in this request based on the email um
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
that i think was sent to the committee
 
01:24:52.149 --> 01:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday from guy eaton who's a
 
01:24:54.149 --> 01:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
member of volunteer new hampshire's
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
executive committee there was a request
 
01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:56.550 align:start position:0%
executive committee there was a request
for

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.750 align:start position:0%
for
um

01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
the the funding request
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be a total of 750 000
 
01:25:07.270 --> 01:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:12.070 align:start position:0%
for other questions
representative

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you uh first if you could get us a
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
print of that
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
that would be great and second the
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
funding request i'm sorry i thought that
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
the idea was that the
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
entire amount that was left
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
in arpa
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
unallocated for this would come to this
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
fund and be used over the years
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
i think i think the the idea is that uh
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is a limited request of 750 000
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the rest of arpa funds so if
 
01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.390 align:start position:0%
it's not the rest of arpa funds so if
it's

01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh incorrect in the the bill as drafted
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
um that is surely the intent that it's
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's limited to
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
a certain amount it's not all leftover
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
funds from
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh american rescue plan representative
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
could i follow up i'm
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
having a little difficulty here sure uh
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
so it would not be a one-time transfer
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
it would be three years
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
and does arpa doesn't go that long does
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
it does
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
and it could be done you know it could
 
01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
be done as a one-time disbursement of
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
750 000 or it could be you know 250
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year over three
 
01:26:39.679 --> 01:26:44.550 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per year over three
years

01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
wrapped indonesian
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
taking our questions uh so after the
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
three year period then how would that
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
work the state would fund it
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
no i actually think that this
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know the way it's envisioned is that
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is it's very much a pilot program
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
it could be a one and done you know this
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
is sort of a stimulus of let's let's get
 
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.629 align:start position:0%
is sort of a stimulus of let's let's get
more

01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
more
uh

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
employers on board from across the
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
public-private non-profit sectors to
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
join employers of national service to
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
make it clear that they are very
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
interested in the talent and experience
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
americorps and peace return peace corps
 
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.149 align:start position:0%
americorps and peace return peace corps
volunteers

01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
as well as colleges and universities to
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
join that
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
americorps schools of service program so
 
01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.430 align:start position:0%
americorps schools of service program so
that

01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
we we are we are very sure based on uh
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know what we've heard from all
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities and employers
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
who have
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh attracted and and
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
these these young people to their
 
01:27:49.110 --> 01:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
colleges into their
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh businesses
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh that these are great workers and so i
 
01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.669 align:start position:0%
uh that these are great workers and so i
think

01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
this this money is very much let's let's
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
increase the number of programs that are
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
participating in in
 
01:28:02.950 --> 01:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know these two existing programs
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit of cash to to get
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
it going but this could be this could be
 
01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:10.719 align:start position:0%
done after three years but what we've
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
done is change the conversation about
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
the valuable resource human resource
 
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.870 align:start position:0%
the valuable resource human resource
that

01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
these members can be in the state of new
 
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.470 align:start position:0%
these members can be in the state of new
hampshire

01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.430 align:start position:0%
follow up
so

01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
unless i miss it is there a place in the
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill where it says
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
three years that i missed that or 250
 
01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.430 align:start position:0%
three years that i missed that or 250
000.

01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
000.
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i think the
 
01:28:33.679 --> 01:28:34.550 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i think the
the

01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's a three-year it's three years of
 
01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.350 align:start position:0%
it's a three-year it's three years of
funding

01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
um the funding the fund could continue
 
01:28:40.639 --> 01:28:41.430 align:start position:0%
um the funding the fund could continue
on

01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:44.070 --> 01:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
by looking at philanthropic sources by
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
looking at uh you know businesses could
 
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
donate to that fund
 
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.750 align:start position:0%
donate to that fund
um

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know there could be there could be
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds made available
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
down the line for it so i don't think we
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily want to close the fund but
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
we also don't necessarily need to
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know i think it would serve a great
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
purpose by
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
existing for three years
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then you know letting the ways and
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
means committee three years from now
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
decide you know what's the future of
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
that fund look like does it need to
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
continue on or is that something that we
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
can close down
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.830 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you
representative

01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i i guess have
 
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.400 align:start position:0%
you gone through the gopher committee
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
and finance and we're talking a lot
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
about several thousand dollars i'm
 
01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and i can't find an
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
actual dollar figure in the bill and so
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
my question is have you gone through
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
gopher have you gone through
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
um you know fiscal committee to see
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
about the appropriation um because my
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
one concern is section two that says the
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall credit which doesn't
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
exactly give the commission a whole lot
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
of wiggle room to say wait they didn't
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate funds i have no funds to
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
credit so what does he do so i'm a
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
little concerned about how that plays
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
out and i'm wondering if you can answer
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
question uh you know reached out to
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner caswell you know over it
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
over at gopher
 
01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.669 align:start position:0%
over at gopher
um

01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think the idea was let's let's see if
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
this is something that the legislature
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
is interested in supporting i mean i
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
think there are a number of different
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
routes that this could go to get funded
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
this was this was one of the one of the
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
follow up so i i guess your idea is just
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
to establish the fund and then if the
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
funds become available use it yeah and
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
if that's the case i'm just a little
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about roman numeral two in
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
here says the commissioner shall credit
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
state funds received from arpa and it's
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
a shall statement not a may statement so
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
that makes it a little
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't yeah i guess i'm trying to
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how we get that conflict
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
settled i may not be necessarily opposed
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
to establishing a dedicated fund for
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
this purpose but i also don't want to
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
put the commission a bind where money is
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
not allocated by the legislature but
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
he's obligated to
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know you understand the conflict
 
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.590 align:start position:0%
you know you understand the conflict
there

01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
i thank you representative for the
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
question i think i understand the
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
conflict um
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know i think the idea is to set up
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the fund and get it funded by arpa at no
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
additional cost to granite state
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and so
 
01:31:08.239 --> 01:31:09.430 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and so
um

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
this this was a mechanism that going the
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
legislative route you know filing
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
legislation was the way that that i
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
could do it again i think there were
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
other ways that this could happen
 
01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.229 align:start position:0%
other ways that this could happen
um

01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know but i think
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know it was it was one of the
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations that was in the service
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
your workforce commission from 2019 and
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know this this was a way to further
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
that recommendation
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i'm still trying to
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh i'm one of the gurus for dedicated
 
01:31:45.679 --> 01:31:46.629 align:start position:0%
uh i'm one of the gurus for dedicated
funds

01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh on this committee
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we have ever
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
created a dedicated fund in which we did
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
not provide some funding mechanism even
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
if it was one that said
 
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
open to donations which usually fails
 
01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
open to donations which usually fails
so

01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
i was assuming that the paragraph uh
 
01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.270 align:start position:0%
i was assuming that the paragraph uh
sub

01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
sub
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
on roman numeral 2 on line 28 to 29
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
meant that
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is going to credit all
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
state funds received from the american
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
rescue plan for the purpose of the
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision to the fund
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
was the
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
was the funding mechanism
 
01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:33.510 align:start position:0%
was the funding mechanism
but

01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
you say that 410 million of 900
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
something which i missed
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
for this program are allocated that
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
obviously does not mean the program that
 
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.229 align:start position:0%
obviously does not mean the program that
is

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:48.239 --> 01:32:49.030 align:start position:0%
is
that

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:51.430 align:start position:0%
that
covers

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
covers
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
returning peace corps volunteers and
 
01:32:54.239 --> 01:32:57.189 align:start position:0%
returning peace corps volunteers and
americorps

01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
that must be
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
the entire arpa
 
01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:04.870 align:start position:0%
the entire arpa
program

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
and that would
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
put 500 million dollars into
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
into your dedicated fund
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
so you're what you're asking for is a
 
01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:22.790 align:start position:0%
so you're what you're asking for is a
three-year

01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
three-year
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
distribution or of 250 000 a year or
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
one year of 750.
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
question yes i think that there's
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's some confusion in how the bill
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
is drafted and how you just summarized
 
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.070 align:start position:0%
is drafted and how you just summarized
what

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know 750 000 in one lump sum or
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
250 000 per year over three years that
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
is uh very much the the hope of
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire uh per the the
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
request that was sent yesterday
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
roman numeral would have to be rewarded
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
to serve the intent of
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think this is really a
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
both a drafting question and a
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
clarification of intent
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the drafting um
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's no way that you could have
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
intended that you were that this bill
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
was going to take all of the leftover
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
money in arpa no way um the intent was
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
that money received from arpa by the
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner for this program would be
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
going into this fund
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
that was the idea and
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
the lack of
 
01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.149 align:start position:0%
the lack of
of

01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
specifics relates to
 
01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.430 align:start position:0%
specifics relates to
well

01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
maybe the legislature needs to speak to
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
how much money should come from arpa and
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's what you've spoken to this
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
morning and you're talking about 750 000
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh max over three years
 
01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.669 align:start position:0%
uh max over three years
so

01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
that for those of us who want to
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
consider this and
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps move forward with it that we
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
need an amendment
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:23.430 align:start position:0%
that would
uh

01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
would do what i've just described make
 
01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:26.950 align:start position:0%
would do what i've just described make
clear

01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
clear
the

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
cap on the limit on the
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of money sought from arpa
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
and uh then that money would go into the
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
fund which under roman three of this
 
01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:39.270 align:start position:0%
fund which under roman three of this
bill

01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
allowed where the commissioner is
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to accept and credit to the fund
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
any other gifts donations and so forth
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
into the fund and who knows maybe it
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
a fund that would have a three-year life
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
or maybe it would have a 100-year life
 
01:35:57.990 --> 01:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know it may uh you know be very
 
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.669 align:start position:0%
we don't know it may uh you know be very
successful

01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
in stimulating interest
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
in the private sector that would
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
generate the funds that would keep it
 
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:06.870 align:start position:0%
generate the funds that would keep it
going

01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of it maybe you
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
could comment on and and whether you'd
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
be willing to offer and
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
to maybe talk to commissioner carswell
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
about language and then
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that we could consider
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
excellent uh representative thank you uh
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
for your summary that is uh exactly the
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent and i think now
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
with this funding request from volunteer
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire around 750 000 over three
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
years uh i would be happy to work on an
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
amendment uh with any members of the
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh to to get this to a point
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
where it's clear
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh and the committee can make a decision
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they want to recommend
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
this to the full house
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
are you all set uh mr chair i
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
fully support what representative ames
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
said that i was going to ask the
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee if we can go forward with an
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative aaron followed by
 
01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:02.629 align:start position:0%
representative aaron followed by
representative

01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:02.639 --> 01:37:04.070 align:start position:0%
representative
elni

01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
elni
 
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so just to be clear
 
01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at the new hampshire
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
state fiscal recovery fund program
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
obligations and which is what you
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
because i also got the link from mr
 
01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.669 align:start position:0%
because i also got the link from mr
caswell

01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
caswell
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
because i was interested as well and so
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan act awarded
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
994.56 million
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal recovery funds to new
 
01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal recovery funds to new
hampshire

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
the first half the first tranche
 
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
the first half the first tranche
was

01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.430 align:start position:0%
was
for

01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
497.28 million which was
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
given to the state in may 2021
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
so of that
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
we have allocated
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
410.02 million
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes there's money in the fund obviously
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
but there's also going to be a whole lot
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
497.28 million next year
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
um or actually this year i'm sorry
 
01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:12.390 align:start position:0%
um or actually this year i'm sorry
um

01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
so yeah i i i just wanted to make that
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
clear to the committee
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
because you know it's kind of fuzzy as
 
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
to how much money we were allocated as a
 
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
to how much money we were allocated as a
state

01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:24.070 --> 01:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
in total and how much
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
the two tranches are are
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
and how much of the first tranche we've
 
01:38:28.239 --> 01:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
and how much of the first tranche we've
already

01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.470 align:start position:0%
already
allocated

01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
allocated
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
but yeah i think it would make sense to
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
put it bring an amendment that would be
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
clearer as to exactly how much money
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the arpa
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
monies that have come to new hampshire
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's a statement not a question oh yes
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry okay
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
i would believe that's a good idea
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you as i understood this
 
01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
originally and i have not seen the
 
01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:06.229 align:start position:0%
originally and i have not seen the
letter

01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
and it's not in my email as far as i can
 
01:39:08.639 --> 01:39:09.990 align:start position:0%
and it's not in my email as far as i can
tell

01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
tell
from

01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:39:12.790 --> 01:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
volunteer new hampshire asking
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
specifically for the 750 000
 
01:39:19.590 --> 01:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
if they sent it
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
i didn't get it
 
01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.189 align:start position:0%
i didn't get it
but

01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:23.199 --> 01:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
but
i

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
what i was concerned with was within
 
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
what i was concerned with was within
arpa

01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
arpa
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
what part of it was allocated as it came
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
in in either trance
 
01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.030 align:start position:0%
in in either trance
to

01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
a program that
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
would fit this categorization i mean the
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
category that this
 
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:46.550 align:start position:0%
category that this
this

01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.669 align:start position:0%
this
project

01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
and that was the question that i had not
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
the percentage of all of arpa
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
when i asked it last time
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative for the
 
01:40:00.719 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative for the
question

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:01.679 --> 01:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
i can i can do a deeper dive on that i
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
think there is a specific category for
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
workforce development
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
so i've heard a few requests
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
here and
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'll make sure that the committee gets
 
01:40:17.189 --> 01:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
both of them one is
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
the detail around
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
how much arpa funds are left in total
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
and specifically for this workforce
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
development fund
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think if i could i think that
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
they it did come in categories we're not
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to spend as i understand it
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
outside of those categories
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
so what we need is the workforce
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
development allocation
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
and how much of it
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
went in the first tranche and what are
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
the companies the competition for the
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
i'll get that information around
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
workforce development i'm not sure
 
01:40:59.830 --> 01:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
we'll know
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know unless commissioner caswell
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
wants to share that with everybody
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
if there are competing priorities
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
um but we'll certainly we'll know what's
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
been spent and what is what is left and
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
if there are any other proposals that
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
are being considered right now we'll try
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
and surface those
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
i think the important thing is
 
01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:20.870 align:start position:0%
i think the important thing is
identifying

01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
what you really want the 750 000 and
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
then if you wanted over
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
one year or three years as has been said
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
that is the money that would be funding
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
this fund
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

but i want to speak really to the
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
general thought
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%

01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
in the north country where i live

01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
started wren
 
01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.910 align:start position:0%

01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
involved people
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
and the kind of people who volunteer
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
whether it's for peace corps or other
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
programs city year
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
they're people who throw themselves into
 
01:42:37.679 --> 01:42:39.189 align:start position:0%
they're people who throw themselves into
projects

01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
we have conservation's core members who
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
learn how to cut trails and so forth
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
out of a vermont agency and those people
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
who stayed around are the people who
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%

and

01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think the concept of keeping the can
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
do sort of people
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%

turn you turn your mic on
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
so sorry
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
i said a bad example so i wanted to
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
see um
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is from an assessor who lives in
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
jefferson which is part of my district
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
coast five
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i want to know whether what he says
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
is true
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
he asked me
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
to vote itl on this bill
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
the bill he said would exempt phone and
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
cable companies from being assessed
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
on their uses public right-of-ways
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
this issue has been debated for more
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
than 20 years and it's become
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
established that there is taxable value
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
to the row that municipalities must
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
value the value is even built into a new
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
formula for assessing other utilities
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
such as electric water and gas
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
there is no reason to unfairly exempt
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
phone and cable companies effectively
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
forcing new hampshire pac taxpayers to
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
subsidize these
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
private companies
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
so is what he says true
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
well it is certainly
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
what he's saying that it is uh taxable
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
property is correct it is taxable
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of new hampshire
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
it would be it would
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh certainly if we at the d.r.a provide
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
oversight of local assessors if they did
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
not put that on the tax rolls it is
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
something we would uh bring to the
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
attention of the select board that it
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
would be a failure of something that if
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
they did not do that
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chairman mr
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
garrity uh
 
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.550 align:start position:0%
garrity uh
if

01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.470 align:start position:0%
if
this

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
bill was passed
 
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
what would happen to
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
the property tax rate in
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
each town that had you said all the all
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
of the municipalities are
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
using this local tax so what would
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
happen to each of their tax rates when
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
you calculated the next tax rate
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
when i said each each is usually using
 
01:49:04.550 --> 01:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
to clarify that they are subject to it
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
it only if they if they utilize it only
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
depends if they have utility properties
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
that are utilizing the right of way
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
which i can't
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
make a blanket statement that that's
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
true for all 259 entities
 
01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.750 align:start position:0%
true for all 259 entities
however

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
what assessed value is it doesn't
 
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
determine how much a municipality spends
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't determine what their
 
01:49:29.669 --> 01:49:29.679 align:start position:0%
appropriations are it's merely a
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
dividing of the pie
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
so the lower your assessed values the
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
lower your taxable assessed value
 
01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
everything else being equal the higher
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
your property tax rate will be
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
so for
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
for every dollar that you exempt from
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
the rolls is a dollar shift
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
to the taxable property
 
01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:48.790 align:start position:0%
to the taxable property
so

01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
everything else being equal the tax
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney
 
01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.149 align:start position:0%
uh representative romney
um

01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
how easy is it to generate a list of
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
every one of these towns and how much
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
what the various uh assessed values are
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
for this uh that that would be an
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
arduous task okay that's all that's all
 
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
i wanna okay yeah it's it's not any it's
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
not information we rightly we regularly
 
01:50:17.910 --> 01:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
have if it is i would have brought it
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
here today okay it's not something will
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
we get uh
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
broken down assessed value by utility
 
01:50:26.709 --> 01:50:26.719 align:start position:0%
we don't get it broken down by utility
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then right of way so there's no way
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
to uh easily come up with that what it
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
would have to be is
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
manually contacting each of these 259
 
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
entities and trying to determine you
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
know if they had the information then
 
01:50:41.669 --> 01:50:41.679 align:start position:0%
collecting it okay i understand thank
 
01:50:41.679 --> 01:50:42.310 align:start position:0%
collecting it okay i understand thank
you

01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:45.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair to follow up on
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative abrami's comments
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
is the rate applied by the various
 
01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:53.750 align:start position:0%
is the rate applied by the various
municipalities

01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
equal across the state or does it vary
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
from town to town
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
the the tax rates vary from town to town
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh we don't have any kind of
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this even though it's a
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
local issue local
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh it would be a local fiscal note
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how much of a
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
revenue shift this
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
this would be in total
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
again we have no way to collect that
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
information i know i did see a report
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
that was submitted to the committee
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
by mr wheeler from the san souci
 
01:51:40.159 --> 01:51:41.430 align:start position:0%
by mr wheeler from the san souci
corporation

01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i looked at that which covers a
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
small section of new hampshire and those
 
01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
numbers seemed
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me
 
01:51:48.719 --> 01:51:50.070 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me
so

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if you could make a rough
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
extrapolation but
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
we could certainly ballpark it but
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
coming up with an exact figure would be
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
which would take a lot of work
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh mr san souci's
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
chart that he gave up
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
are those numbers the assessed values or
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
the taxes paid do we know or if so maybe
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
somebody from
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative mr san souci's company
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%

01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i would defer it to you okay thank
 
01:52:23.679 --> 01:52:24.470 align:start position:0%

just as soon as if there's no further
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
question any further questions of the
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative from the dra
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you thank you sir
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
we want to sit down
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
my name is jim wheeler i'm with uh
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
sansusi's office and i provided that
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
report and just wanted to answer the
 
01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.390 align:start position:0%
report and just wanted to answer the
question

01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
those are assessed values
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
represent me
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little late to be trying to
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
figure this out but there was something
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
in our paper yesterday morning
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
on lebanon is one of the san souci
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
clients which i realized
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
we used to have our own assessor
 
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.910 align:start position:0%
we used to have our own assessor
on

01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
there are there is a last mile in
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
lebanon between lebanon and hanover and
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
142 houses in it which is going to be
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
linked to broadband
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
on by 60 000 of arpa money and
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
535 000 of comcast money which works out
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
to 4.2 thousand
 
01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:53.030 align:start position:0%
to 4.2 thousand
4

01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
4
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:58.629 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
what would be the tax
 
01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
what would be the tax
that

01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd have to go back and get our
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking assessed value yeah we
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
were talking assessed value so i'd have
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
to translate it back to the tax to see
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
about 20 cents
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
i made that i said if your rate is 20
 
01:54:25.669 --> 01:54:25.679 align:start position:0%
cents uh
 
01:54:25.679 --> 01:54:26.629 align:start position:0%
cents uh
uh

01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
our tax rate is a lot higher than 20
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
cents it's 20 dollars and
 
01:54:35.189 --> 01:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.199 --> 01:54:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
dollars

01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
are you all set representing me yeah
 
01:54:46.629 --> 01:54:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i need to spend some time
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this and looking at any
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%

01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so for the committee
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
remember in the last meeting we i talked
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
about the idea of trying to create an
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
enablement statute for this to allow to
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
go town by town to see if towns wanted
 
01:55:09.510 --> 01:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
to wave that
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that was not going to happen
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
i worked at ols and the drafting of that
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
amendment was pretty dramatic and pretty
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
drastic it was basically going to create
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
where we have like pilot programs for
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
solar programs those can create they
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
called it a silent program services in
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
lieu of taxes and it was a pretty
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
significant lift um and maybe you know
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to take that on for a
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
future bill that may be possible
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
but under the current bill the way it
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
was written it would so dramatically
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
change it i'm not sure it wouldn't be
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
germaine anymore because it creates a
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
whole new set section of law so that was
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
abandoned just to let everybody know
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
that's why that i i did try to do that
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
we did try to work through it it was
 
01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
we did try to work through it it was
unable

01:55:49.510 --> 01:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
unable
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
i am concerned about the bill is written
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily improve expansion
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
services it gives a tax break and that's
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
for sure but it doesn't necessarily
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
approve expansion services so
 
01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:01.750 align:start position:0%
approve expansion services so
um

01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to already update on that
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
because i did bring it up last meeting
 
01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.030 align:start position:0%
because i did bring it up last meeting
okay

01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions on
 
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.589 align:start position:0%
any further comments or questions on
1494.

01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
i want to go to house bill 1509
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
relative determination of the firearm
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have mr buffetti from the attorney
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman members of the
 
01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.030 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman members of the
committee

01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh last week there were some questions
 
01:56:47.599 --> 01:56:49.830 align:start position:0%
uh last week there were some questions
about

01:56:49.830 --> 01:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
what state government has done uh after
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
the frm um
 
01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:56.390 align:start position:0%
the frm um
debacle

01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
debacle
 
01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.189 align:start position:0%
debacle
uh

01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
to and so i can respond to that to the
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
extent that the committee wants to
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
hear that
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh so um in 2014 the legislature
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
passed um a statute it's rsa chapter 21u
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
which uh deals with interagency
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
information sharing by financial
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
services regulators
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh so this was an attempt uh to make
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
those agencies specifically
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
the bureau of of securities regulations
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
the banking department the insurance
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
department and the department of justice
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
who receive consumer complaints related
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
to financial services issues that
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're talking to each other
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
and i i can tell you because i was the
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
consumer protection bureau chief for
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
nine years uh and i was
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
i was chief when this statute was passed
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
and implemented that it has resulted in
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
much higher level of
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh exchange of information between those
 
01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:04.310 align:start position:0%
uh exchange of information between those
agencies

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
so the the statute requires that there
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
um there'll be regular meetings
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh with people from those agencies to
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
talk about complaints that uh that
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
they're seeing that may be a mutual
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
interest to the other agencies those
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
meetings have been happening regularly
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
since the statute was passed
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
there were also common interest
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
agreements between those agencies to
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
share the information in some cases the
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
information has to be kept confidential
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
so there's there's um
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
there are terms that would require
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
certain information
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
especially sensitive financial
 
01:58:40.390 --> 01:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
information to be get to be kept
 
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
confidential and there has been a
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
regular dialogue uh with these agencies
 
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:47.189 align:start position:0%
regular dialogue uh with these agencies
uh

01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
especially with uh with the bureau of
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
securities regulation
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
um to talk about in uh cases of
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
investment fraud and so my office and
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
bsr has worked uh very closely over a
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
number of years to to make sure they
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
were talking about cases that they're
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
looking at they also may have criminal
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
components and that where they were
 
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
working these cases together
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
there was also a statute that was passed
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
by for the banking department
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
um one of the one of the issues here has
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
been that by state law the consumer
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
which is what empowers the attorney
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
general's office to to to to function in
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
this area
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
contains what's called an um exemption
 
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.109 align:start position:0%
contains what's called an um exemption
clause

01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
clause
 
01:59:39.270 --> 01:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
and so essentially what that says is
 
01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:40.310 align:start position:0%
and so essentially what that says is
that

01:59:40.310 --> 01:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:41.189 align:start position:0%
that
any

01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:59:43.589 --> 01:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
trade or commerce that is under the
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of certain agencies like
 
01:59:48.950 --> 01:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
banking insurance
 
01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:50.709 align:start position:0%
banking insurance
securities

01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
securities
 
01:59:50.719 --> 01:59:51.990 align:start position:0%
securities
puc

01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
puc
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
that that that trade or commerce is
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
exempt from the consumer protection act
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
so it in effect ties the hands of the
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general so that we cannot act
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
in those areas
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
that uh where the trade and commerce is
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of
 
02:00:12.390 --> 02:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
of those of those other state agencies
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
so one of the responses to that was and
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
i was bureau chief we worked very
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
closely with the banking department
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
to pass a a comparable statute
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
in uh the banking statute that pro that
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
that prohibits unfair and deceptive
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
practices and that requires that our two
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
offices be coordinating in
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
investigations and prosecutions of these
 
02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
investigations and prosecutions of these
cases

02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
so i i can say that um
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
those those were difficult lessons that
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
were learned i became bureau chief post
 
02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:45.830 align:start position:0%
were learned i became bureau chief post
frm

02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
frm
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
most of my nine years as bureau chief i
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
was focused on making sure
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we didn't
 
02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:53.750 align:start position:0%
that we didn't
miss

02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
miss
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
important issues that we needed to be
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
addressing on a statewide level that had
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
to do with investment fraud banking
 
02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:02.310 align:start position:0%

mortgage fraud and that we were talking
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
to each other in ways that we could
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh head off
 
02:01:12.550 --> 02:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of a of a bigger issue down
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
the road
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that things won't get
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
missed it does but it does mean that we
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
have all
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
focused on trying to make sure that
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking to each other sharing
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
information and working much more in a
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
cooperative way to address um issues
 
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
that that we may hear about uh and that
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
to be addressed by state enforcement
 
02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:37.910 align:start position:0%
to be addressed by state enforcement
people

02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%

we have some members here who weren't
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
here in the first
 
02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.149 align:start position:0%
here in the first
hearing

02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh can you can you just give us uh it
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
sounded like for not hearing that
 
02:02:00.070 --> 02:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
that the train is down to track on this
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
and how just refresh your memories again
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
how close are we to actual checks going
 
02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:05.350 align:start position:0%
how close are we to actual checks going
out

02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like we're getting there pretty
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
close uh but can you just
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
say that one more time please sure so
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
last week um the director of the of the
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
charitable trust unit at the ag's office
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
tom donovan testified before you um this
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
has been has been uh delegated by
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
legislation to
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
to his unit within the ag's office
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
they've hired someone they have a we
 
02:02:33.510 --> 02:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
have a 10 million dollar victims fund
 
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
have a 10 million dollar victims fund
we

02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
began just a couple of weeks ago
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
soliciting um
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
applications for victims under that fund
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
we expect to be processing those i think
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's a deadline of of uh six eight
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
weeks or so before uh so we can process
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
those with the hope of being able to to
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
to get money out as soon as the statute
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
allows us to do so i think that the
 
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
money doesn't go out until the end of
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
the year by statute
 
02:03:00.719 --> 02:03:01.750 align:start position:0%
the year by statute
but

02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
the process is in place we've hired
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
somebody we have it on our website we've
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
put out a press release we've encouraged
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
those who think that they were victims
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
of firearm to come forward and to and to
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
apply for uh the funds uh in that
 
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.270 align:start position:0%
apply for uh the funds uh in that
account

02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i asked this question in a preliminary
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
way when we
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
were talking about this bill last time
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
but the it relates to what's available
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
for public uh review
 
02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.669 align:start position:0%
for public uh review
um

02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
we we've got a process now where
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
applicants can respond to this new
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
setup that you have and uh
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
and request and identify themselves as
 
02:03:50.950 --> 02:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
victims if that's the right word and
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh identify a claim
 
02:03:58.149 --> 02:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
and other details i suppose so what's
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to be available
 
02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
can you speak to the
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
public records aspect of this thing yes
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
so certainly the amounts that are paid
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
out of the fund and to whom they're paid
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
will be public there has to be
 
02:04:15.679 --> 02:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
will be public there has to be
uh

02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
that level of transparency um
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
the actual uh application information
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
may contain
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
some confidential sensitive information
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
that that should be shielded
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
disclosure so i think we're going to
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to look at that you know as it
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
comes forward but
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
clearly these are public funds
 
02:04:40.719 --> 02:04:41.430 align:start position:0%
clearly these are public funds
they

02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
that that the public has a right to know
 
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
who ultimately receives them and how
 
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um are there
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
existing lists of uh
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
of claimants uh from uh
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know the time when you were there
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
and on uh that
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
might also be subject to public review
 
02:05:05.199 --> 02:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
might also be subject to public review
um

02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
i so i don't know the answer that
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
certainly people that have come forward
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i know that
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
that we were that we are aware of
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
a potential pool of applicants and so as
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
part of our outreach in launching this
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
application process
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
we we sent letters directly to them
 
02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
we we sent letters directly to them
so

02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not they uh apply um
 
02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:38.229 align:start position:0%
whether or not they uh apply um
um

02:05:38.229 --> 02:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
we'll have to see
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's public
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's not a a question i i'm
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable answering right now i don't
 
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that then there may
 
02:05:52.069 --> 02:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
be reasons why that they they um their
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
identities don't become public
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
information at this point uh but there's
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
there were certainly people that were
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
that were public about it and um and if
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
their names are in the public forum
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
obviously that's that's information that
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.679 --> 02:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair i beg
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
permission to ask about this exemption
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
clause in a more general way
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
than just this particular this is the
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
first time i have ever heard the
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
department talk about it
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
since i was told that they exempt
 
02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with condominiums
 
02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.030 align:start position:0%
anything to do with condominiums
uh

02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%

02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
does this also
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
why does it include condominiums and
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
does it
 
02:06:43.599 --> 02:06:44.870 align:start position:0%
does it
on

02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
also include all of the trades and
 
02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
professions that are regulated under the
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure
 
02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
so representative thank you but so let
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%

02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
issue about condominiums
 
02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:02.069 align:start position:0%
issue about condominiums

02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
we are not exempt from dealing with
 
02:07:05.199 --> 02:07:06.709 align:start position:0%
we are not exempt from dealing with
condominiums

02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
condominiums
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
um we only deal with a certain aspect of
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
it so
 
02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:11.669 align:start position:0%
it so
um

02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%

02:07:12.550 --> 02:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
we register condominium
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
projects with the ag's office
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
what we don't do and it's not that we're
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
exempt from it it's just we don't have
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have a function to do that what
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
we don't do is resolve disputes between
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
condominium owners
 
02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
once the project is developed and the
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
reason for that is simple this is a
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
consumer protection step to make sure
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
that if people if if people are buying a
 
02:07:38.079 --> 02:07:39.430 align:start position:0%
that if people if if people are buying a
condominium

02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
that they that they will get what they
 
02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
were promised in the in the the
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
statements that were advertising the
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
condominium so if it says you're going
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
to have this condominium with a pool and
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
tennis courts and all of these amenities
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that that is
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
actually what the consumer gets and that
 
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
it meets certain standards so it's a way
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
up front to make sure that the developer
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
is is fulfilling their promises to
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
consumers and so we we're very active in
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
that registration of condominiums and
 
02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:09.350 align:start position:0%
that registration of condominiums and
subdivisions

02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
the exemption clause
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
is in 358a
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
section 3 which exempts
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
trade and commerce under
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
under highly regulated um
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
industries uh
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
parts of the economy
 
02:08:29.189 --> 02:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
that was the theory of it so again
 
02:08:29.199 --> 02:08:30.310 align:start position:0%
that was the theory of it so again
banking

02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
banking
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of of state on or
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
federal banking authorities
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
insurance state federal or other state
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
insurance authorities
 
02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
insurance authorities
securities

02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
securities
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh both state and federal uh and and puc
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh so the idea was that because they
 
02:08:50.550 --> 02:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
were highly
 
02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:51.830 align:start position:0%
were highly
regulated

02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:52.709 align:start position:0%
regulated
that

02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
that the consumer protection act which
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits unfair and deceptive business
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
practices generally
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
that that wouldn't apply to those
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the issue of the
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
exemption clause um
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
has been a perennial issue although i
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it's come up this year but i
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
think i've been involved in that issue
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
for nine to ten years testifying in
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
front of the house commerce committee
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative john hunt
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
is very familiar with that issue he's
 
02:09:25.430 --> 02:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
probably one of the experts in the state
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
on on the exemption clause
 
02:09:29.990 --> 02:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we have gone back and forth with
 
02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.589 align:start position:0%
and we have gone back and forth with
that

02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
that was a choice that was made new
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire sort of is a in a very small
 
02:09:38.709 --> 02:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
number of states that exempts the
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act from from
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
in in in this way
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i've testified to try and change
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
that exemption clause frankly uh we were
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
successful in the banking context we
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
were able to reach a compromise that we
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
could put the same protections in the
 
02:09:57.669 --> 02:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
banking statute we haven't done the same
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
thing with insurance and with securities
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
but it it does exist um
 
02:10:05.510 --> 02:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
and it but it is only for those those
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
highly regulated in terms of oplc
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
02:10:11.990 --> 02:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
um so
if

02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh if if an if a nurse is engaging
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
in unfair or deceptive business
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
practices and the nurse is licensed by
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
we can bring a consumer protection act
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
against that nurse in fact i've done
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
that um you know that they've actually
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know but you have to you have to
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
actually be putting out your services
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know publicly that you advertise
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
that you have certain credentials that
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
that could be a potential consumer
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
protection act and we could bring action
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:48.239 --> 02:10:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:10:51.430 --> 02:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question i have two questions
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
the same ones i ask of one of the
 
02:11:00.229 --> 02:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill uh first is
 
02:11:04.149 --> 02:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
does uh is the current process a
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
used terminology used by others a make
 
02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
used terminology used by others a make
whole

02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
whole
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
process that is under the current
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
process is the
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh person who is defrauded made whole in
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form
 
02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.149 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form
no

02:11:16.149 --> 02:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that was the answer that i
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
think you asked that last week to mr
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
donovan and the answer was no thank you
 
02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.830 align:start position:0%
donovan and the answer was no thank you
i

02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
just and the other question is a
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
philosophical one and uh
 
02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.950 align:start position:0%
philosophical one and uh
um

02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the state has
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
no liability for the bureaucratic miss
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
and malfeasance associated with this and
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
use your term debacle
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
no uh i i think that there was a a a
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
failure um
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
to uh identify the issues
 
02:11:54.149 --> 02:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
that were going on in frm
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
um you know there have been lots of
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
reports that were written about that uh
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
to try and figure out exactly what
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
happened there was a lot of finger
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
pointing uh
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
and that's not particularly helpful uh
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
02:12:09.589 --> 02:12:09.599 align:start position:0%
we needed to fix it and we need to make
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't happen again and
 
02:12:14.310 --> 02:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
put in in in
 
02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:15.189 align:start position:0%
put in in in
place

02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
um systems so that we are talking to
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
each other and trying to identify
 
02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
problem areas and it's and it doesn't
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
get missed because agencies are talking
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative schamberg
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the public
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
review we had on this i had a question
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
that i haven't found an answer yet to
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
was the state
 
02:12:45.119 --> 02:12:46.229 align:start position:0%
was the state
found

02:12:46.229 --> 02:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
found
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be in a court of record liable and
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
thus responsible for the loss
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
of these monies
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
that were invested with frm
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
i i i don't know the answer
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh that i can say with certainty i don't
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
think so
 
02:13:06.629 --> 02:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't think so but i i can't
 
02:13:09.430 --> 02:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
tell you um i wasn't that familiar i i
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't i wasn't doing that work when
 
02:13:14.470 --> 02:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
firm happened and i was more focused on

that the reason i asked for us to get
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
the chapter law
 
02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:56.709 align:start position:0%

so that we could read it on was that
 
02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.669 align:start position:0%
so that we could read it on was that
we

02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
there is some kind of some sunset in the
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
chapter law and
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to get chapter law
 
02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to get chapter law
since

02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
eldon thompson's sold
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
the rights to our rsas to himself

02:15:37.510 --> 02:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
but they are in the lbao somewhere and i
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't know i presume the attorney
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
general's office has it
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it would be nice to be able i mean
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
frequently it would be nice to be able
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
to get the chapter law do you have the
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
number of the chapter
 
02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:50.790 align:start position:0%
number of the chapter
no

02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:53.430 align:start position:0%
no
jim

02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
so representative i
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
are you asking for the statute that
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
established this fund
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
yes and the chapter law that came out of
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
that i can get that to you and i can i
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
can email it to the committee great
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you here
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
any anything else we need on
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
1509 if not
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%

house bill
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
1565-f and i shouldn't have made that
 
02:16:32.719 --> 02:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
1565-f and i shouldn't have made that
statement

02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the opioid abatement
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%

02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
corresponds do we need what else do we
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
need to address
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
does the attorney general's office have
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
any comments on
 
02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.830 align:start position:0%
any comments on
your

02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement trust fund
 
02:17:15.990 --> 02:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman james buffetti
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general's office um i
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
i hope i got almost all of you
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh in email with attachments i
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh the last time there was questions
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
about if there was any information
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
from hhs about
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
drug overdoses
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is probably much more than you
 
02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:39.349 align:start position:0%
this is probably much more than you
wanted

02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
and it may not be in the form that you
 
02:17:43.669 --> 02:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
wanted but it there is that i so i sent
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh to all the committee members i could
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
find by email the new hampshire drug
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring initiative
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
which breaks down some information
 
02:17:51.519 --> 02:17:52.870 align:start position:0%
which breaks down some information
geographically

02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
geographically
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
so i hope that was helpful to you
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
i also because i think there was a
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:02.399 --> 02:18:03.509 align:start position:0%
 
included

02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
two charts which have
 
02:18:08.549 --> 02:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
the the distribution
 
02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh using the 2020 the 2010 census
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
figures and the 2020 census figures
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
these are the um
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
the 23 litigating subdivisions
 
02:18:26.389 --> 02:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh under the statute 126 a colon 83
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
that qualify
 
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:28.709 align:start position:0%
that qualify
for

02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
at the ti at the present time the 15
 
02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:32.709 align:start position:0%
at the ti at the present time the 15
percent

02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
which is how the current statute
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
is structured so that any opioid
 
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
settlement funds that come into the
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
state or to any subdivision
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
that 15 percent off the top
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
go to those
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that filed opioid
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
related lawsuits prior to september 1st
 
02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:55.429 align:start position:0%
related lawsuits prior to september 1st
2019

02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
2019
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
and so we made one distribution because
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
we got that money from them from that
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
that settlement with um mckinsey
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh it was about 415 000
 
02:19:11.349 --> 02:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
and it is it was based on the 2010
 
02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
census because that's what this the
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
current statute says
 
02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:15.030 align:start position:0%
current statute says
um

02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
so so just as a
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
as a if it's if it's not self-evident
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
which i hope it was i tried to make it
 
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.030 --> 02:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
so you see the numbers for each county
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
in the first column
 
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
belknap 6088
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
and then you see the actual percent of
 
02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
distribution that they would get of the
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
15 percent
 
02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
15 percent
so

02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
so because in belknap
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
um laconia and belmont have
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
both participating subdivisions then
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
according to the statute you would
 
02:19:51.439 --> 02:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
according to the statute you would
deduct

02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
deduct
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
their numbers from the total number of
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
people who live in belmont county to get
 
02:20:00.309 --> 02:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
the belmont share at belknap county to
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
get the belknap share and the reason you
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
do that is because if you don't then you
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
end up double counting people
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh you would count them twice so if you
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't if there's no mechanism for
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
instance in hillsborough
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
um you know there was um there's 109 000
 
02:20:17.670 --> 02:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
people who live in manchester and 86 000
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
who live in nashua if you didn't do that
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
then then then then the the
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
would be counting those people in
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
manchester and nashua twice uh and that
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
mathematically there's no way of getting
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
to a hundred percent of the population
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh so you have to do that in order to
 
02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
have a fair distribution of the funds
 
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:43.349 align:start position:0%
have a fair distribution of the funds
so

02:20:43.349 --> 02:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh so this is the the two thou i just wa
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to show you that the the the
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
2020 census figures so you have a sense
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
of how things have changed it hasn't
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
really changed that much the population
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
has gone up
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
by about
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
50 000 or so people but to see where
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
those changes are and so
 
02:21:04.469 --> 02:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh with the current statute this is what
 
02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
we would use
 
02:21:09.429 --> 02:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh as a a distribution formula
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
um so that for instance if we got 10
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars in
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
then under the current formula 15 of 10
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
million would be distributed to these 23
 
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
counties on with that percent so that so
 
02:21:26.469 --> 02:21:26.479 align:start position:0%
so carroll county we get 3.6 of
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that didn't confuse you too
 
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:32.790 align:start position:0%
hopefully that didn't confuse you too
much

02:21:32.790 --> 02:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to answer any questions if
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
i did
questions

02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative aaron
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr befetti
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chair for allowing my
 
02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:46.710 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chair for allowing my
question

02:21:46.710 --> 02:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
question
so

02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
you you talk about
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
but is it true that the counties
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
have different programs than what the
 
02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
individual municipalities may have
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
and that they serve different purposes
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
well similar they're similar purposes
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
but they are different programs
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
sure and primarily because the counties
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
run the houses of corrections so each
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
county has a house of correction and
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
most of them have programs run out of
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
their houses of corrections that deal
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
with opioid use disorder
 
02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:26.070 align:start position:0%
with opioid use disorder
inmates

02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
inmates
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
and so the the town of
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
of keene
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that sign of a program
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
but the counties
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
is is it true that the counties don't
 
02:22:42.309 --> 02:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
only just have
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
um these map programs
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
through the jail system they have other
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
programs that are opioid abatement
 
02:22:51.439 --> 02:22:52.710 align:start position:0%
programs that are opioid abatement
programs

02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:22:54.790 --> 02:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
that they are paying for right now
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
sure i mean it of course it differs by
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
county so
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
stratford county uh which probably has
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
the most in terms of programming
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
also they have the the the the suboxone
 
02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:08.630 align:start position:0%
also they have the the the the suboxone
um

02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment kind of
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
services that they that they distribute
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
that which is very expensive but they
 
02:23:15.830 --> 02:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
also have
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh have uh treatment programs that are
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
provided for inmates while they're
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerated but not all counties have
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
that so it depends it varies county by
 
02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.990 align:start position:0%
that so it depends it varies county by
county

02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
county
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%

02:23:39.830 --> 02:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i've been trying
 
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
to match this overdose
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
drug overdose um
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%

02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
cities
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
on i don't have any problem with
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
distributing more to the counties
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
because the counties add up to the state
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
and everybody gets to participate what i
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
have trouble with is picking out
 
02:24:11.750 --> 02:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh 12 cities and one town
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
on from the rest of the towns
 
02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:17.270 align:start position:0%
on from the rest of the towns
and

02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%

once from the county
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%

more than five places that are small

enough an area that you can't
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
see the names without taking more time
 
02:25:34.389 --> 02:25:34.399 align:start position:0%

02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i think given the fact that lebanon
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
only is in the 26 to 100 that this is
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
based on where the people
 
02:25:52.950 --> 02:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
who overdosed were living
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
rather than where they ended up in
 
02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:57.590 align:start position:0%

hospital
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's from it's where the
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
incident was where the interaction was
 
02:26:02.640 --> 02:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
incident was where the interaction was
with

02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
with whoever the first responders or
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
whoever for instance if they if they
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
they happened to be in manchester um
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
because they went there for
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
to look for treatment resources but they
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
lived in dover then uh
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
and they were given narcan
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
that it would be a manchester incident
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
not from where they were living but from
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
where i think it's from where the
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
incident i can clarify that with hhs but
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
that would be my
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
sense because it because it it has to do
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
has to do with really where the services
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
are being administered
 
02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:38.710 align:start position:0%
are being administered
um

02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
and so not if not not where they were
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
where they would claim as their as their
 
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:45.830 align:start position:0%
where they would claim as their as their
residents

02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
residents
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
pathetic because i did ask you that
 
02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
question last week about
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
the geographic distribution and i
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the charts you did send
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
and so my question is if you're looking
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
at to be equitable and fair in the
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
distribution of the funds available
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
my question simply i guess would be is
 
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
it your opinion that
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
forty percent of the the increase number
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
now forty percent of the the the
 
02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:15.030 align:start position:0%
now forty percent of the the the
um

02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh the the
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
people affected by the drug overdoses in
 
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
the opioid crisis are in the 23 entities
 
02:27:23.590 --> 02:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned because
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
if i look at the charts
 
02:27:28.550 --> 02:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
the ems overdose incidences and abuse in
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
the narcan administration is fairly
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
diffused throughout the state
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
02:27:37.190 --> 02:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
in fact if the 23 townships or
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities represent 40
 
02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:40.790 align:start position:0%
municipalities represent 40
of

02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the need then it's fair but when i
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
look at the charts in the map it doesn't
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
make sense to me in some ways so is your
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that
 
02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:52.150 align:start position:0%
opinion that
40

02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
40
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
is represented within those 23 areas no
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
um and i think representative army just
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
read a whole list of give your answer
 
02:28:00.319 --> 02:28:01.190 align:start position:0%
read a whole list of give your answer
again

02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
no okay so representative army we had a
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
whole list of of of communities
 
02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:07.590 align:start position:0%
whole list of of of communities
that

02:28:07.590 --> 02:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
did not
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
hire outside counsel to file lawsuits
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
that would not even though that they
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
have significant needs hudson
 
02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh happens to be my my neighbor i live
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
in litchfield so
 
02:28:19.359 --> 02:28:20.150 align:start position:0%
in litchfield so
uh

02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
huds hudson
 
02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.790 align:start position:0%
huds hudson
um

02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
would not
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
share in that 40 percent um so i mean
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
here's my
 
02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
my my point there is this the system
 
02:28:33.910 --> 02:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we have now would say that 85 of
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
the opioid money
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be available to any community
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
based on their need
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
so that we don't need to at this point
 
02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:43.990 align:start position:0%
so that we don't need to at this point
decide

02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
decide
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh based on these figures
 
02:28:49.270 --> 02:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
who has the most need that needs going
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
to fluctuate so this is over 18 years
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
right we're going to be dealing with
 
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
this so um so what the town of of
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
of of lebanon has a particular issue
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
that they want to address
 
02:29:02.309 --> 02:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
they should be able to come to the
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
commission we can evaluate all of those
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
grant applications there's a system
 
02:29:11.190 --> 02:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
there and decide how to distribute
 
02:29:14.070 --> 02:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
fairly the 85 percent in a way that does
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
the most good for the most people that
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
system is there that system hasn't had a
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
chance to work yet that system i believe
 
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
will work and be more fair to address
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
the needs that fluctuate over time with
 
02:29:29.429 --> 02:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
this opioid crisis
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and if this bill went through
 
02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
that 85 would go down to sixty percent
 
02:29:39.590 --> 02:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
it would be we have forty percent right
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
sixty percent okay yes correct
 
02:29:47.190 --> 02:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
represent aaron
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
profetti for taking my question
 
02:29:53.359 --> 02:29:54.309 align:start position:0%
profetti for taking my question
so

02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:54.319 --> 02:29:55.270 align:start position:0%
so
you

02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh say that the um there is a system in
 
02:30:00.469 --> 02:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
place already for these municipalities
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
to file for grant money
 
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
and you know how long it takes between
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
or what can you explain the criteria
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
first of all and secondly the time that
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
it will take for municipality from the
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
time that they claim
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh an amount to receiving the funds
 
02:30:23.510 --> 02:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
so as we talked about last week um
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
we hope that the
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
that the gel car will approve the rule
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the first
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
getting it established is the is is the
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
biggest the biggest chore we're there we
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
have the rules
 
02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:35.590 align:start position:0%
have the rules
done

02:30:35.590 --> 02:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
um we hope that it gets approved in the
 
02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
next month or so
 
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
um the goal and i think it's in the
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
rules is that we would distribute the
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
money as quickly as we could and and so
 
02:30:49.750 --> 02:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
if there was um 500 000
 
02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
in that account in that fund
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
that would trigger
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:30:58.469 --> 02:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
the asking for grant applications so
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
whenever that happened because the money
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
could come in in in spits uh and
 
02:31:07.270 --> 02:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
starts and spurs uh so we'd have to uh
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
we could we get a level of five hundred
 
02:31:09.990 --> 02:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars at five hundred
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we would try and get
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
that money out as quickly as we could
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so once the rules get approved the
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
expectation is that we would be sending
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that money out on a fairly regular basis
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's a pretty tight timeline from
 
02:31:26.389 --> 02:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
when we would solicit applications we
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
have 30 days the commission has a has a
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
time after receipt of it that they have
 
02:31:33.750 --> 02:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
to meet and make some decisions the
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
decisions of course would be
 
02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
would have to go to the government
 
02:31:40.230 --> 02:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
council because they would make the
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
final decisions about the grand awards
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
that we recommended to them
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
but i think the hope would be to to get
 
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
this money out uh as quickly as possible
 
02:31:58.150 --> 02:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you again for taking a
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
saying if you if gelcar does it
 
02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
saying if you if gelcar does it
approve

02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
the plans or for your your uh
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
your method of distributing funds
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
and then you said there's a there's a
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
step of going through the executive
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
council and so forth how long does that
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
period of time take
 
02:32:28.950 --> 02:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
well i mean usually
 
02:32:30.710 --> 02:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
you need a few weeks notice to get
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
something on the on the government
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
council agenda
 
02:32:34.319 --> 02:32:36.790 align:start position:0%
council agenda
so

02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
we have two point three million dollars
 
02:32:40.469 --> 02:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
that us that's the sitting in the trust
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
fund so once the rules get approved
 
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
we would have applications we would
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
solicit applications as quickly as we
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
could after that within the next few
 
02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:50.950 align:start position:0%
could after that within the next few
days

02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
um and then we would receive those
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
applications the commission would go
 
02:32:57.190 --> 02:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
through them they would they would they
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
would try and and sort them out to
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
what what what are the best uh the best
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh ways to use that money for the for
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
the best effect
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and then make those
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh applications makes that uh available
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
to the for the governor council to act
 
02:33:16.389 --> 02:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
on as quickly as possible i mean it's it
 
02:33:18.309 --> 02:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
is government so you know you're giving
 
02:33:18.319 --> 02:33:19.270 align:start position:0%
is government so you know you're giving
away

02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
essentially government funds and there
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
has to be a certain process in which to
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
do that you know so no matter where it
 
02:33:27.990 --> 02:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
goes i'm assuming if it goes
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
into a city you know there has to be a
 
02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
certain appropriations process receiving
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
and accepting funds figuring out what to
 
02:33:37.590 --> 02:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
do with it you know there's no
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
there's no governmental entity that can
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
take the money and spend it the next
 
02:33:42.389 --> 02:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
week you know because there's certain
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
public disclosures of public hearings
 
02:33:46.309 --> 02:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
there are things that have to happen
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
02:33:49.349 --> 02:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
but but the goal is to try and get this
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
as streamlined as possible which is what
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
the rules reflect
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh and that we would hope to get the
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
money out like i say as quickly as we
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
could do we have somebody else
 
02:33:58.080 --> 02:33:59.910 align:start position:0%
could do we have somebody else
questions

02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
questions

so we're talking about the mckinsey
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
settlement right now 2.7 ish 2.76
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars of which would you say
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
400 114 i think 1000 went out to the to
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
those 23 subdivisions okay thank you so
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
follow follow up so
 
02:36:09.349 --> 02:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
but if we the change this change from 15
 
02:36:11.429 --> 02:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
to 40 we're really really looking down
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
the road here as well
 
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
and there's probably
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
even bigger settlements coming down the
 
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
road is that safe to say so
 
02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:20.790 align:start position:0%
road is that safe to say so
um

02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to report that uh we so we
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
joined a national uh settlement with the
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
three major opioid distributors
 
02:36:31.910 --> 02:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh companies named mckesson
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
corporation cardinal health and
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
amerisource bergen it's a national
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
settlement with 21 billion dollars
 
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so we've done a sign-on process to
 
02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:43.910 align:start position:0%
and so we've done a sign-on process to
get

02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
get
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
support from new hampshire it looks like
 
02:36:48.150 --> 02:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying subdivisions in new hampshire
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
have joined us in signing on which is
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful news so we should get the
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
maximum amount uh which is approximately
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
115 million dollars over 18 years
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
from that settlement alone so that'll be
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
a steady stream of income that will be
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh to the state in addition there are
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
other settlements that are working
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
through you've probably seen the things
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
on on uh purdue pharma and the oxycontin
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
maker and there's a there was announced
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
that there's a potential
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
settlement with the sackler family
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
that would provide for
 
02:37:28.469 --> 02:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
we would have a certain amount of that
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
money would come in uh millions of
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
dollars would come in and there were
 
02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
other cases so
 
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's it's
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
probably 150 to 180 million dollars that
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
could come into the state over the next
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
18 years
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
mr buffett
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
johnson and johnson just announced a
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
settlement does that affect new
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire no
 
02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
so so johnson so johnson johnson um
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
they also entered into a national
 
02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:01.670 align:start position:0%
they also entered into a national
settlement

02:38:01.670 --> 02:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:38:04.550 --> 02:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
with uh with states
 
02:38:06.790 --> 02:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
we opted not to
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
join that um we have a trial scheduled
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
the trial was was was supposed to start
 
02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:14.469 align:start position:0%
the trial was was was supposed to start
yesterday

02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
but the court had to continue it because
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
of covert concerns and concerns about
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
about how do we keep a jury he has a
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
jury trial
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
so the case is continued until right
 
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
after labor day but we we're still
 
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
planning on going to
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
trial uh here in concord against johnson
 
02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:36.630 align:start position:0%
trial uh here in concord against johnson
johnson

02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
johnson
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
so the 115 million dollar settlement
 
02:38:44.469 --> 02:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
for the
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
against the distributors or with the
 
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.429 align:start position:0%
against the distributors or with the
distributors

02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
distributors
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
so did any counties or cities or towns
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh were they part of this or is it
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
or how's this going to work so they so
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
so under the current statute it doesn't
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
make any difference if
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
if if a a county a city or town
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
filed an opioid related
 
02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:08.070 align:start position:0%
filed an opioid related
lawsuit

02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
02:39:09.510 --> 02:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
prior even if they didn't name the
 
02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
particular defendants for instance none
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
of them named mckinsey as a defendant
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
but because there was opioid related
 
02:39:19.590 --> 02:39:19.600 align:start position:0%
money that under the current statute
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
even though they didn't they didn't
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
actually name them they didn't join any
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against them
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
they were entitled to their share of 15
 
02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:27.910 align:start position:0%
they were entitled to their share of 15
so

02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:29.990 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:39:29.990 --> 02:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
for those 23 who had filed opioid
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
related lawsuits as a matter of fact
 
02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
though most of them probably all of them
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
did name these three distributors as
 
02:39:44.469 --> 02:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
defendants in the lawsuits that they
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
filed all their lawsuits like i said
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
they were filed in federal court they've
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
all been stayed in the federal court in
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
cleveland ohio
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
with no action being taken on them for
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
the last two years just to follow
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is interesting so
 
02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
because they took action early on
 
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to benefit quite a bit
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
going forward with this these kind of
 
02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
settlement numbers correct right i mean
 
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
just 15
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
is is a significant amount they will get
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
that but remember also
 
02:40:14.399 --> 02:40:15.110 align:start position:0%
that but remember also
that

02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't prevent them from also
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
applying for grants under the 85 percent
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's no bar
 
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
so if if uh if the if the if the town of
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
um of nashua will get their share the 15
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
of any money but they could also come in
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
and ask for
 
02:40:36.469 --> 02:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh for us to consider funding a grant
 
02:40:38.469 --> 02:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
under the 85 percent there's no bar for
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
them to do that
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
spellsbury

02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
spellsbury
 
02:40:49.349 --> 02:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um attorney
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
bethetti very complicated topic and i
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the patience you've given the
 
02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:55.590 align:start position:0%
appreciate the patience you've given the
questions

02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh you've clearly indicated your
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
but as my my simplistic understanding is
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
that the bill proposes two different
 
02:41:04.319 --> 02:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
that the bill proposes two different
things

02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
one is to eliminate the
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
apparent uh population penalty uh that
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
hits the counties
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
and the other is to raise the percentage
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's shared
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
under this formula
 
02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:21.190 align:start position:0%
under this formula
so

02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:23.429 --> 02:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering are you objecting to
 
02:41:25.110 --> 02:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
both of those and if so are you
 
02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
objecting to them with equal vehemence
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes and for different reasons so
 
02:41:33.349 --> 02:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think the math works if you
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't if if you don't exclude uh from
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the county's number
 
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:39.910 align:start position:0%
the county's number
those

02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
those communities that were also going
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
to be getting money then you can't get
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
to a hundred percent i mean you're
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
double it's it's not a and i i
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a population penalty
 
02:41:53.910 --> 02:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's a double counting people so
 
02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:55.190 align:start position:0%
it's a double counting people so
manchester

02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
and and nashua um a big chunks out of
 
02:42:00.550 --> 02:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county that doesn't work so
 
02:42:02.150 --> 02:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
well for hillsborough county as an
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
entity because they had their two
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
largest communities uh join these
 
02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:07.590 align:start position:0%
largest communities uh join these
lawsuits

02:42:07.590 --> 02:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
but if you don't then then then
 
02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county would get a windfall
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
because they would count they they would
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
count the people in manchester and
 
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
nashua in their total the total
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
population for the county of
 
02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:21.990 align:start position:0%
population for the county of
hillsborough

02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
even though that they were hillsborough
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
and and nashua were getting separate
 
02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:28.070 align:start position:0%
and and nashua were getting separate
checks

02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
checks
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
for for their share of the 15
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
so if you do that
 
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
how do you get to 100
 
02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know at the end of the day you have
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
to have you know this is the population
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
and we divide up a share of the total
 
02:42:43.269 --> 02:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
population like the charts show
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
um so it it what it does it it it and
 
02:42:48.389 --> 02:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's what the current statute does it
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't double count
 
02:42:50.319 --> 02:42:51.590 align:start position:0%
it doesn't double count
people

02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
02:42:56.790 --> 02:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
i understand your logic
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
about double counting and windfall
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
i'm not totally
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm convinced
 
02:43:05.439 --> 02:43:06.230 align:start position:0%
sure that i'm convinced
as

02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative omni
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
indicated before the counties in the
 
02:43:13.349 --> 02:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
aggregate comprise the entire state
 
02:43:13.359 --> 02:43:14.389 align:start position:0%
aggregate comprise the entire state
and

02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:16.550 --> 02:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
they have their own programs
 
02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
they have their own programs
and

02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know to the extent for example that
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
those are administered through their
 
02:43:23.190 --> 02:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
jail operations they
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
benefit all of the communities within
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
the county
 
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
without regard to whether one city
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
within the county happened to be a
 
02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:31.190 align:start position:0%
within the county happened to be a
litigant

02:43:31.190 --> 02:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
litigant
 
02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:32.150 align:start position:0%
litigant
but

02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:43:35.429 --> 02:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
why couldn't we do both why couldn't we
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
accord weight to each county according
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
to their full population
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
so as to give
 
02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
a relative benefit for the probable size
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
of their program and its cost
 
02:43:49.429 --> 02:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
while at the same time recognizing that
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
these 13
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
cities did in fact take the initiative
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
to litigate
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.309 --> 02:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
so you know in in some cases
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
in some of the smaller towns
 
02:44:03.910 --> 02:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know some of the smaller counties
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
with smaller towns
 
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
that might
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
might make some sense to me
 
02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
i don't want to speak for manchester but
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm going to guess having worked closely
 
02:44:14.950 --> 02:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
with the with the city attorney in
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
manchester that they
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
would object to them getting
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
less money because they manchester and
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
nashua do have a lot of of opioid
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
related programs that they run a lot of
 
02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
people go to those cities from other
 
02:44:32.309 --> 02:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
places in new hampshire looking for
 
02:44:32.319 --> 02:44:33.910 align:start position:0%
places in new hampshire looking for
services

02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
so um i mean i i do think that that you
 
02:44:38.469 --> 02:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
could certainly you could certainly
 
02:44:39.830 --> 02:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
figure this out i mean you could give
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
all the money to the counties you know
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
you could say we're going to just give
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
all we're going to just give the money
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
to the counties and let the counties and
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
the cities you know figure out how they
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to share that
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
you could do that that's a policy
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
question for this legislature
 
02:44:55.520 --> 02:44:57.349 align:start position:0%
question for this legislature
my

02:44:57.349 --> 02:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
my my biggest concern was that
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
that to to single out just those who
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
filed lawsuits
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
to the exclusion of others
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
is profoundly unfair it doesn't address
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
the need so because you hired an outside
 
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
law firm on a contingency fee basis and
 
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
they filed a a complaint
 
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's all you did that's i mean that's
 
02:45:25.429 --> 02:45:25.439 align:start position:0%
all you did in this case so
 
02:45:25.439 --> 02:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
all you did in this case so
um

02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
and that they then get a windfall
 
02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
because they did that
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh to the exclusion of communities that
 
02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:35.030 align:start position:0%
uh to the exclusion of communities that
didn't

02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:45:37.590 --> 02:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
um doesn't seem to be fair and it
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't address
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
the problems that exist in other parts
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the state where they didn't file
 
02:45:45.990 --> 02:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
these lawsuits they shouldn't be
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
penalized at this point because really
 
02:45:51.750 --> 02:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
this is about abating a crisis and
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
stopping people from dying of of opioid
 
02:45:57.910 --> 02:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses and so they're dying in hudson
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
and they're dying in manchester but
 
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
because hudson didn't file
 
02:46:05.030 --> 02:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't get a disproportionate
 
02:46:07.670 --> 02:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
amount of money to manchester because
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
they did hire outside counsel who filed
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
a complaint on their behalf that's my
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're the prime sponsor on this
 
02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:31.590 align:start position:0%
you're the prime sponsor on this
and

02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
if there was a public hearing
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
you got me
 
02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:38.870 align:start position:0%
you got me
representative

02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to grasp understand i miss
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing so i'm trying to get
 
02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
catch up to speed here but as as the
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
exists now 85
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the fund is used for the disbursement
 
02:46:54.630 --> 02:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
those funds are dispersed are used for
 
02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
basically directed fires right allow
 
02:46:58.630 --> 02:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
people to apply for grants and apply for
 
02:46:58.640 --> 02:46:59.830 align:start position:0%
people to apply for grants and apply for
programs

02:46:59.830 --> 02:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
and and be able to take care of
 
02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
immediate needs of what's going on in
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
the you know a dynamic response to the
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to this opioid epidemic is that correct
 
02:47:11.349 --> 02:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
in my understanding so not people well i
 
02:47:13.349 --> 02:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
mean communities i understand community
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
so it would be it'd be for 85 would be
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
available to any
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
any political subdivision in the state
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
who had an idea now it has to be with
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
one of those approved uses for opioid
 
02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
abatement has to be for opioid abatement
 
02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:28.630 align:start position:0%
abatement has to be for opioid abatement
but

02:47:28.630 --> 02:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:47:30.070 --> 02:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
they could they could come up with a
 
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
very different idea and the the and so
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
what you know what goffstown proposes
 
02:47:38.309 --> 02:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
may be very different from what berlin
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
proposes and that's fine you know but as
 
02:47:44.070 --> 02:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
long as it's one of those approved uses
 
02:47:47.110 --> 02:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh then they could apply uh and they
 
02:47:48.630 --> 02:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
could be considered for
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
their share of the 85 percent and should
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
i i should say also remember the state
 
02:47:55.990 --> 02:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
is taking no money here you know uh in
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
in other states the state took a cut of
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
the money
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh we opted not to do that we wanted as
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
much as possible to go
 
02:48:07.830 --> 02:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
for abatement of the crisis so that we
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
could get this money out now some of the
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
money may go to state agencies
 
02:48:14.550 --> 02:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
my guess is that commissioner hanks is
 
02:48:17.110 --> 02:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to be looking for funding
 
02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
for the state prison system
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
and there may be programs at hhs there
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
may be other things so state agencies
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
can certainly apply but they would be in
 
02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
an equal footing to
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
to hillsborough county
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
who applied for funds
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you one follow-up
 
02:48:35.110 --> 02:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
so just let you know uh
 
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:36.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you for

taking my question i'm curious that 13
litigants

02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
litigants
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
that are gonna
 
02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
get a settlement uh can they be refused
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
these funds that are set aside
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
as it as it sits right now the 13 so i
 
02:49:08.640 --> 02:49:10.389 align:start position:0%
as it as it sits right now the 13 so i
mean

02:49:10.389 --> 02:49:10.399 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
the entities that that are going to get
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
a separate settlement
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
can they be denied
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
these funds the the 85 percent
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
i apologize i'm not sure i understand
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
they apply
 
02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
if the city of manchester for instance
 
02:49:29.429 --> 02:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
gets a settlement
 
02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
specific to a certain agreement
 
02:49:35.110 --> 02:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
and they apply for funds
 
02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:36.230 align:start position:0%
and they apply for funds
that

02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:37.429 align:start position:0%
that
this

02:49:37.429 --> 02:49:37.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
this settlement will
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
be in the pool can they be denied those
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
funds through the process of application
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
sure i mean any application can be
 
02:49:49.990 --> 02:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
denied and there's no there's nothing
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
that says that the commission would
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
recommend funding of any particular
 
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
project but
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
but if manchester got a separate
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
settlement under state law that money
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
has to go into the opioid abatement
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
so if manchester got a settlement with
 
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
with with a opioid manufacturer over and
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
above it
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
the state law requires that all opioid
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
settlement funds go into the opioid
 
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund and that the 15 off
 
02:50:22.230 --> 02:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
the top get distributed by population to
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
those litigating subdivisions and the 85
 
02:50:27.269 --> 02:50:27.279 align:start position:0%
percent is going to be used by the state
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
for opioid abatement purposes so
 
02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:31.110 align:start position:0%
for opioid abatement purposes so
so

02:50:31.110 --> 02:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.469 align:start position:0%
so
manchester

02:50:32.469 --> 02:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
they could i suppose they could
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
try and do a separate settlement but
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
they couldn't keep the money they would
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
have to give it to the opioid abatement
 
02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
are you all set
 
02:50:46.710 --> 02:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative romney
 
02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
don't know beat this to death but
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
so let's just use the johnson johnson
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
example because we're doing this on our
 
02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:56.230 align:start position:0%
example because we're doing this on our
own

02:50:56.230 --> 02:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
as a state
 
02:50:59.830 --> 02:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
so just just to reinforce this these 23
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions although the ones that are
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
going to get that 15 only still those 23
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
for the johnson johnson there were no
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
other litigants
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:51:13.990 --> 02:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:51:15.590 --> 02:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:18.389 align:start position:0%
um
well

02:51:18.389 --> 02:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
there so there were these 23
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions who filed opioid lawsuits
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
prior to september 1st 2019 right
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
they uh and all of them i believe named
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
johnson johnson and jansen but um
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
interestingly there were five school
 
02:51:38.160 --> 02:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
interestingly there were five school
districts

02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
districts
 
02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh in this state who also filed opioid
 
02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:44.309 align:start position:0%
uh in this state who also filed opioid
lawsuits

02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuits
 
02:51:47.790 --> 02:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
but they filed them after september 1st
 
02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
2019 so they don't qualify to share in
 
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the 15 percent
 
02:51:54.870 --> 02:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
by state law all right so just get the
 
02:51:56.150 --> 02:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
tentacles a little bit more it's a
 
02:51:58.150 --> 02:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
little more complicated okay now the
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
interesting it's it's an interesting
 
02:52:01.990 --> 02:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
question about j and j right because
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're not accepting the we're not
 
02:52:06.870 --> 02:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
joining the national settlement
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
so interesting question is
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to those cases that the
 
02:52:14.070 --> 02:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions filed against them that are
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
now stayed in federal court in cleveland
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm hoping that those counties and if
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
there are people here that that talk to
 
02:52:24.950 --> 02:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
the counties that they encourage their
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
council to have those cases remanded
 
02:52:29.429 --> 02:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
back to new hampshire for trial because
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to trial they could do the
 
02:52:33.750 --> 02:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
same thing they could go to trial
 
02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
um but that's up to them and their
 
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
outside the national council what they
 
02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
decide to do but as it stands now
 
02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know there would be there could
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
potentially be
 
02:52:44.479 --> 02:52:45.590 align:start position:0%
potentially be
uh

02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
24 trials against j and j in new
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire because we're going to go to
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
trial against them
 
02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
the only way that the subdivisions can
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
resolve their case is to go to trial
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh or to try and settle it with them in
 
02:53:00.950 --> 02:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
some way but
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping that they will actually
 
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
have their cases remanded back to
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
federal court in concord and try their
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair just
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
from my understanding of federal court
 
02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
activities the federal court could also
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
deny all those and combine them into one
 
02:53:25.269 --> 02:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
large case um
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
file and
 
02:53:28.070 --> 02:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
to heck with it
 
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
and that's sort of what they did so it's
 
02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
this they call it this multi-district
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
litigation some of these these these
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
huge uh tort cases so
 
02:53:41.190 --> 02:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
so every
 
02:53:44.230 --> 02:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
every case that was filed against by a
 
02:53:46.710 --> 02:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivision in the country
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
they all were consolidated in one court
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
with one judge in cleveland ohio and
 
02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
those case
 
02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
cases have basically been been sitting
 
02:53:57.910 --> 02:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
there doing nothing he's the judge has
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
tried a couple of cases but they've been
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
sort of these test cases but there are
 
02:54:04.070 --> 02:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of cases that are sitting in
 
02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
the cleveland mdl that have stayed that
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
nothing's happening with them
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
and at some point the judge is going to
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
have to do something with them you know
 
02:54:15.349 --> 02:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
he can either try them in cleveland so
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
sullivan county could have a trial in
 
02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
sullivan county could have a trial in
cleveland

02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
cleveland
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
on their case against j and j or he
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
could send them we manda back to new
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire for a trial in front of a
 
02:54:29.349 --> 02:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.389 --> 02:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.399 --> 02:54:36.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:54:36.790 --> 02:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:38.950 --> 02:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
i don't understand what damage was done
 
02:54:41.269 --> 02:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
to a school district
 
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
when the services provided
 
02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
to the individual were provided by the
 
02:54:47.670 --> 02:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
community not by the school
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
how did they get where's their standing
 
02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:51.830 align:start position:0%
how did they get where's their standing
well

02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
i mean standing's a different issue
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
whether they can prove any damages you
 
02:54:58.150 --> 02:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
know again is another issue as well i i
 
02:54:58.160 --> 02:54:59.030 align:start position:0%
know again is another issue as well i i
mean

02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:55:01.750 --> 02:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
listen anyone can file a complaint and
 
02:55:03.990 --> 02:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
um but and because representative
 
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
because there's been no litigation in
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
those cases right we litigated those
 
02:55:10.230 --> 02:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
issues we had hearings on the
 
02:55:11.990 --> 02:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
defendant's motion to dismiss our
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
complaint and that was litigated that's
 
02:55:16.309 --> 02:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
what i mean when i say that these these
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions never litigated anything
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
because the cases have been stuck in
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
this federal court in cleveland so you
 
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
know it's very possible that if this
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
these cases went forward against the
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
school districts that they would have
 
02:55:31.670 --> 02:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
had motions to dismiss and the judge
 
02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:35.359 --> 02:55:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:55:36.870 --> 02:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
since we're a dylan rule state
 
02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't that
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
kind of i mean doesn't that kind of
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
already say that the separate suits
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
black standing i'm sorry i missed the
 
02:55:49.269 --> 02:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
first part of your question since new
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a dillon rules state
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
and the towns and cities and school
 
02:55:54.800 --> 02:55:55.670 align:start position:0%
and the towns and cities and school
boards

02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:55:58.790 --> 02:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't have anything
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
that don't have any ability to do
 
02:56:02.550 --> 02:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
anything that the state doesn't say that
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
they can do doesn't that kind of
 
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
preempt their ability to file these
 
02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:09.110 align:start position:0%
preempt their ability to file these
suits

02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
suits
 
02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious you know actually uh
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
you're on to something uh and uh it's so
 
02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
i doesn't i wouldn't preempt them
 
02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
the ability to file it it could uh it
 
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
could prompt the state to go to court to
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
say these estate claims you can't bring
 
02:56:29.269 --> 02:56:29.279 align:start position:0%
these claims um we've not chosen to take
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
that we've chosen to try and uh and and
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
work with the cities towns and counties
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
to try and and figure out a way to do
 
02:56:39.269 --> 02:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
this but we could have
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
moved to extinguish all of these
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
complaints filed by cities towns
 
02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
counties school districts we just didn't
 
02:56:50.309 --> 02:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
want to we thought there was more
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
helpful in the long term to work
 
02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
together and trying and you know come
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
together on this thank you sir thank you
 
02:56:57.910 --> 02:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair for that
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr buffetti
 
02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to contribute
 
02:57:10.110 --> 02:57:10.120 align:start position:0%
to house bill
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
1565 with questions or requirements
 
02:57:15.510 --> 02:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
saying none
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative aaron yes
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
county manager ferland had sent us some
 
02:57:25.750 --> 02:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
information as well and i was wondering
 
02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
if he may come up and speak to the
 
02:57:32.070 --> 02:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
the accounting manager from
 
02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
the accounting manager from
berlin

02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
berlin
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
sense it
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
close to lunchtime
 
02:57:59.750 --> 02:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you would
 
02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
concentrate on any new
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
information and then we can ask
 
02:58:07.750 --> 02:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:58:09.269 --> 02:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair ladies and
 
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
gentlemen of the committee uh derek
 
02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
ferlin the sullivan county manager
 
02:58:15.510 --> 02:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
i did send an email with a couple of
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
attachments earlier this week
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit to make sure that
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions or if there's
 
02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
any misunderstandings about what i
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
provided but i'd also like to
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
also respond to what i just heard from
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
mr befetti
 
02:58:33.830 --> 02:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
in general with the documents i provided
 
02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
it was an attempt to i think reframe
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
this discussion about fairness versus
 
02:58:38.319 --> 02:58:40.710 align:start position:0%
this discussion about fairness versus
effectiveness

02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's possible
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
to have a fair
 
02:58:47.670 --> 02:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
distribution but one that would not be
 
02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
very effective conversely i would argue
 
02:58:51.590 --> 02:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
that an effective distribution would
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
also be inherently
 
02:58:53.680 --> 02:58:55.030 align:start position:0%
also be inherently
fair

02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
fair
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
speaking of the issue of fairness the
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
population penalty or the double
 
02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
counting it's there are two sides of the
 
02:59:02.230 --> 02:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
same coin
 
02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
my position is that the population
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
penalty is inherently unfair
 
02:59:07.279 --> 02:59:08.230 align:start position:0%
penalty is inherently unfair
um

02:59:08.230 --> 02:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
sullivan county population of about 44
 
02:59:11.590 --> 02:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
000 people
 
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 30 percent
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
from the city of claremont alone
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
the city of claremont decided to join
 
02:59:19.030 --> 02:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
so therefore sullivan county share is
 
02:59:24.550 --> 02:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
decremented by the population of
 
02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:25.750 align:start position:0%
decremented by the population of
claremont

02:59:25.750 --> 02:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
02:59:27.429 --> 02:59:27.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at the sullivan county
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
department of corrections population
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
today you won't be surprised to see that
 
02:59:33.670 --> 02:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
about 30 percent of our population
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
is comprised of people from claremont
 
02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:38.399 align:start position:0%
so the opioid abatement programs and
 
02:59:40.790 --> 02:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
activities we run
 
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
services population we don't submit a
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
separate bill to the city of claremont
 
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
we are responsible for those programs
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i suspect most counties in the state
 
02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
are in the same situation with a
 
02:59:52.230 --> 02:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
proportional share
 
02:59:53.910 --> 02:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
of their inmates
 
02:59:55.830 --> 02:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
from municipalities that may or may not
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
have joined the lawsuit
 
02:59:58.950 --> 02:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the importance of making sure
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
that we get our full calculated share of
 
03:00:02.950 --> 03:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
these funds to make sure that these
 
03:00:02.960 --> 03:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
these funds to make sure that these
programs

03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
programs
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
are offered to those citizens as well
 
03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
it's a compromise solution and i
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in my in my letter
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of getting to a
 
03:00:15.110 --> 03:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
hundred percent as mr buffett mentioned
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh if you establish a pool of
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
funding that needs to be distributed yes
 
03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
that's how the hundred percent just
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
03:00:26.469 --> 03:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
the revised formula in this in this bill
 
03:00:28.790 --> 03:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
is a direct calculation
 
03:00:31.510 --> 03:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
for each of the 23 entities that decided
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
to join the litigation prior to
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
september 1st 2019
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
because we have counties and
 
03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:37.750 align:start position:0%
because we have counties and
municipalities

03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:00:39.190 --> 03:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why this direct
 
03:00:41.190 --> 03:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
calculation results in a bit of a
 
03:00:43.750 --> 03:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
mathematical anomaly it's not a perfect
 
03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
mathematical anomaly it's not a perfect
solution

03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
but i would i argue that it's far more
 
03:00:49.750 --> 03:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
fair than the legislation has currently
 
03:00:52.550 --> 03:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
written in rsa 126
 
03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
that is unfair so if fairness is our
 
03:00:56.790 --> 03:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
guiding principle
 
03:00:56.800 --> 03:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
guiding principle
um

03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
i firmly believe that fixing the
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
population penalty is an absolute must
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
as to the
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
question of whether these are equitably
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
distributed with a 40 allocation factor
 
03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
i provided two attachments from the same
 
03:01:13.190 --> 03:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
data set that mr befetti referenced the
 
03:01:15.670 --> 03:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
state's drug monitoring initiative
 
03:01:17.910 --> 03:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
attachment one is a color-coded map
 
03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
showing the overdose deaths in 2021
 
03:01:22.950 --> 03:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
the bright colors jump out
 
03:01:25.590 --> 03:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
and it proves that roughly
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
50 percent of the deaths last year in
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
this state
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
were from seven municipalities those
 
03:01:34.469 --> 03:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
same seven are among the 13 that joined
 
03:01:35.910 --> 03:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
the litigation so
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i think a reasonable person would have
 
03:01:40.070 --> 03:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
a hard time arguing that overdose deaths
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
is probably not the most important
 
03:01:43.990 --> 03:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
metric when it comes to the opioid
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
crisis after all it's about lives saved
 
03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
and so if half of the deaths are
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
occurring in just
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
seven of these municipalities i'm sorry
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the 13.
 
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
i misspoke the 13 municipalities that
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
are part of this lawsuit
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
comprise 50 of the deaths last year
 
03:02:05.429 --> 03:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
if i'd had time to go back beyond 2021 i
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
would have i just between last wednesday
 
03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
and this wednesday i didn't
 
03:02:08.960 --> 03:02:09.750 align:start position:0%
and this wednesday i didn't
so

03:02:09.750 --> 03:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
the revised funding formula is going to
 
03:02:15.030 --> 03:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
provide a proportional amount
 
03:02:17.349 --> 03:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
of settlement dollars that is very
 
03:02:21.190 --> 03:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
roughly in line with overdose deaths
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
that makes a heck of a lot of sense i
 
03:02:25.269 --> 03:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
think that's an effective way to quickly
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
and effectively distribute the funds
 
03:02:29.590 --> 03:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
where they are needed most
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
without waiting for weeks and months of
 
03:02:34.070 --> 03:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic processes again
 
03:02:35.349 --> 03:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
the commission's going to operate in the
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
best interest i think of the residents
 
03:02:38.790 --> 03:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
of this state but as mr buffett pointed
 
03:02:40.550 --> 03:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
out it's government
 
03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to inherently take a lot of
 
03:02:42.080 --> 03:02:43.030 align:start position:0%
it's going to inherently take a lot of
time

03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's an exaggeration
 
03:02:46.950 --> 03:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
to say that this issue is literally one
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
of life and death
 
03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:50.070 align:start position:0%
of life and death
um

03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
again go back to the to the overdose
 
03:02:51.920 --> 03:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
again go back to the to the overdose
deaths

03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
03:02:53.040 --> 03:02:54.389 align:start position:0%
deaths
um

03:02:54.389 --> 03:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:57.510 --> 03:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
so if the 40 allocation factor provides
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
a greater share of resources to the
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
communities that experienced fifty
 
03:03:03.830 --> 03:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
percent of the overdose deaths last year
 
03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think that makes a heck of a lot of
 
03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:06.550 align:start position:0%
i think that makes a heck of a lot of
sense

03:03:06.550 --> 03:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
attachment two
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
was the the color-coded map that showed
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
where the ems
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
overdose and abuse incidents were
 
03:03:17.190 --> 03:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
and it's hard to calculate a specific
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
number because the data are aggregated
 
03:03:20.950 --> 03:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
and they're binned
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
so i assumed a midpoint for every
 
03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:24.710 align:start position:0%
so i assumed a midpoint for every
category

03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
category
 
03:03:27.110 --> 03:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
and for again for the 13 municipalities
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
on that map they account for
 
03:03:29.279 --> 03:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
on that map they account for
78

03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
78
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
of all of the ems uh
 
03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
overdoses and incidents
 
03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
so again whether you're talking deaths
 
03:03:39.510 --> 03:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is 50 percent or
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
responses which is 78
 
03:03:44.870 --> 03:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think it makes a lot of sense to
 
03:03:47.190 --> 03:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
provide a greater share
 
03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what this formula in the
 
03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
house bill does
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
one other point that really
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
has not come out either the public
 
03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
hearing or the subsequent work sessions
 
03:03:58.230 --> 03:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
mr befetti has characterized our joining
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the national litigation as all we did
 
03:04:02.469 --> 03:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
was sign on the dotted line
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
i mentioned in the public hearing that
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's not true we spent hundreds of
 
03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
hours with our national attorneys
 
03:04:11.349 --> 03:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
helping with the negotiations that are
 
03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
going on in the in the case in ohio
 
03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:14.790 align:start position:0%
going on in the in the case in ohio
um

03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
validating past claims detailing future
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
abatement programs and their
 
03:04:21.429 --> 03:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
evidence-based efficacy that we expect
 
03:04:22.469 --> 03:04:22.479 align:start position:0%
to achieve
 
03:04:24.070 --> 03:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so again hundreds of hours and that
 
03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
was just for sullivan county i suspect
 
03:04:29.190 --> 03:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
the other 23 have done much the same
 
03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
an important part of that is back in
 
03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
2018 when we decided to join this
 
03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
national lawsuit there was no trust
 
03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
the trust wasn't created until last year
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
so at that time the state had only taken
 
03:04:44.150 --> 03:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
legal action against just a handful of
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
defendants i don't know if it was three
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
and there was no expectation that the
 
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
state was going to share in any of the
 
03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:53.830 align:start position:0%
state was going to share in any of the
proceeds

03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
proceeds
 
03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
should they have resulted in any kind of
 
03:04:58.150 --> 03:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
legal claims um
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
in our favor
 
03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
so the only hope that we had at that
 
03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:02.630 align:start position:0%
so the only hope that we had at that
time

03:05:02.630 --> 03:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
of getting any funding to help with our
 
03:05:07.190 --> 03:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
local programs was to join the national
 
03:05:09.190 --> 03:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
litigation so it wasn't a case of well
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's all we did it was our only option
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
it was our only option of trying to
 
03:05:15.910 --> 03:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
obtain a share of the litigation that we
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
and one other point again i just want to
 
03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we're clear when mr buffett
 
03:05:33.269 --> 03:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
says that this this revised formula
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
provides more funding to the 23
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
to the exclusion of the others that
 
03:05:39.670 --> 03:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
simply is not true
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh the 40 allocation factor as was noted
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
by some members
 
03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
means that 60 percent still goes to the
 
03:05:48.230 --> 03:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
trust that is not the same thing as
 
03:05:50.230 --> 03:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
saying to the exclusion of to the
 
03:05:51.990 --> 03:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
exclusion of would mean that nobody else
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
gets anything
 
03:05:55.030 --> 03:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
and so we were very careful in the
 
03:05:56.950 --> 03:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
crafting of what would the number be
 
03:05:59.190 --> 03:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
because the 40 factor quite frankly was
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
a number on a spreadsheet it could it
 
03:06:02.950 --> 03:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
could have been something different but
 
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
we wanted to land somewhere that we
 
03:06:06.309 --> 03:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
thought was equitable
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
and fair and still provided ample
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
resources for those
 
03:06:12.070 --> 03:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
numerous communities that decided in
 
03:06:13.110 --> 03:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that they had a
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
15-month window and the bar was very low
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh to not join this national litigation
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that we've achieved that uh
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
the pie charts show
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
how that mckinsey settlement was
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
actually distributed uh versus how it
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be distributed and any future
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
settlements would be distributed
 
03:06:32.790 --> 03:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i really hope mr befetti and his
 
03:06:32.800 --> 03:06:33.830 align:start position:0%
and i really hope mr befetti and his
team

03:06:33.830 --> 03:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
team
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
actually put the wood right to johnson
 
03:06:36.870 --> 03:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
and johnson i hope that when this case
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
is heard later this year
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
they emerge victorious
 
03:06:40.479 --> 03:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
they emerge victorious
um

03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:43.429 --> 03:06:43.439 align:start position:0%
i provided a couple of links to some
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
recent articles to suggest that the that
 
03:06:48.389 --> 03:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
might not be as easy as it sounds uh
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
johnson and johnson prevailed in
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
california and in oklahoma two states
 
03:06:54.070 --> 03:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to assume have
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
significant resources at their disposal
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the state to try those
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
cases and so far johnson and johnson is
 
03:07:00.560 --> 03:07:03.429 align:start position:0%
cases and so far johnson and johnson is
2-0

03:07:03.429 --> 03:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
and so if if new hampshire tries that
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
case and loses
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
we get nothing and so that at that point
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
the math becomes very simple fifteen
 
03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
percent of zero is zero eighty-five
 
03:07:17.349 --> 03:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
percent of zero is zero
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
forty percent of zero is zero
 
03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't matter you know we can
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
haggle about it all we want but if if we
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
try and lose
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
the trust gets nothing
 
03:07:29.110 --> 03:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
the national settlement could be our
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
best and only hope in some cases to
 
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
provide funding that will benefit
 
03:07:33.120 --> 03:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
provide funding that will benefit
everybody

03:07:34.230 --> 03:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
whether it was the 23 entities that
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
decided to take action or the 200 odd
 
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
entities that decided to to not they
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
important to note i think the the
 
03:07:54.150 --> 03:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
the methodology and the rationale behind
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
the the adjustments
 
03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
um when you look at the data and i'm a
 
03:08:00.230 --> 03:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
big fan of data-driven decision-making
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh where half of the people in this
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
state died last year those communities
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
are going to get more funding directly
 
03:08:07.910 --> 03:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
without having to navigate additional
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
layers of bureaucracy and if we're
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
really worried about helping with this
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
problem we should be worried about the
 
03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
the best way
 
03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
maybe not necessarily the fairest way
 
03:08:18.389 --> 03:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
but if we do it the best way i think
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to be inherently fair
 
03:08:22.469 --> 03:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i'm happy to
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:29.750 --> 03:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i have this trouble with both
 
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
charts though yours is a lot harder
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
because it was very fuzzy
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
as it came through it's impossible to
 
03:08:36.960 --> 03:08:37.910 align:start position:0%
as it came through it's impossible to
read

03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
read
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
but on they do look similar
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
on there is this enormous
 
03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
on there is this enormous
on

03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
1 to 25 i can't read it on yours but i
 
03:08:49.750 --> 03:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
could read it
 
03:08:49.760 --> 03:08:50.550 align:start position:0%
could read it
on

03:08:50.550 --> 03:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:08:52.389 --> 03:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
on his
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
one to 25
 
03:08:55.680 --> 03:08:57.990 align:start position:0%
one to 25
incidents

03:08:57.990 --> 03:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
all the way up to a hundred and then all
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
the way up to 200 and such and you're
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
taking a median which
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
middle point which may or may not be
 
03:09:09.680 --> 03:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
middle point which may or may not be
real

03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
real
 
03:09:13.510 --> 03:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
did they refuse to provide
 
03:09:15.750 --> 03:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
actual data
 
03:09:18.389 --> 03:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
for each municipality which i'm i'm much
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
more concerned with the municipal
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
problem because a lot of the
 
03:09:25.910 --> 03:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities that i thought should
 
03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
municipalities that i thought should
have

03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:09:30.389 --> 03:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
joined this lawsuit if they knew all
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
this stuff was coming
 
03:09:33.200 --> 03:09:34.870 align:start position:0%
this stuff was coming
would

03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
have been left out
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i did contact
 
03:09:39.760 --> 03:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i did contact
the

03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
people that maintain the data on that
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
website i did get a response and the
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
response was the data are aggregated if
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
you want it disaggregated you have to
 
03:09:50.309 --> 03:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
contact these other people and that was
 
03:09:52.469 --> 03:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
as of friday last week i didn't do that
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
because i didn't think i'd have time to
 
03:09:56.309 --> 03:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
get it and make sense of it so yes i did
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
make an assumption by taking the
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
midpoint of that pooled uh of those
 
03:10:01.510 --> 03:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
pooled categories
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
you could argue whether that was
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not so the the 78 percent
 
03:10:06.710 --> 03:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
could be a plus or minus i suspect it is
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
a big plus or minus but i think it
 
03:10:10.389 --> 03:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
proves the point though that the
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
majority whether that's vast majority or
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
a simple majority of ems overdose and
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
abuse incidents occurs in those 13
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
communities i think it'd be a hard point
 
03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
to refute even with the limitations of
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
that data set as presented
 
03:10:28.630 --> 03:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i'd disagree with that but uh
 
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
can the committee ask to get this stuff
 
03:10:33.910 --> 03:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
disaggregated so that we've got some
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
distribution across the municipalities
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
we do have the problem that the more
 
03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
rural municipalities probably didn't
 
03:10:45.269 --> 03:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
report things that got reported
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
would you um
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
take it upon yourself to check with hhs
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
and see if they could provide that oh
 
03:10:57.359 --> 03:10:59.269 align:start position:0%
and see if they could provide that oh
boy

03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
boy
 
03:11:01.190 --> 03:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
apparently this is coming out of the
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
medical examiner's office or that's just
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.349 --> 03:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
so that's two places i i can i can try
 
03:11:17.990 --> 03:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
since we now have tomorrow and friday
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:25.349 --> 03:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair real quick so
 
03:11:29.670 --> 03:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
i i'm worried about dynamic i spent a
 
03:11:31.750 --> 03:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
decade as a cop and i know that drugs
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't stand still they move
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
and from community community the new
 
03:11:38.389 --> 03:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
drug that comes up maybe show up in a
 
03:11:39.990 --> 03:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
different part of the state
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
how does
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
under the change that's proposed how
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
does we deal with that dynamic nature
 
03:11:47.110 --> 03:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
like all of a sudden sullivan county
 
03:11:48.950 --> 03:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
solves its problem because it gets us 40
 
03:11:50.389 --> 03:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
and it deals with its problem and it no
 
03:11:52.630 --> 03:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
longer has an issue but we're locked in
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
to this 40 percent
 
03:11:56.550 --> 03:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
over the next 18 years right so my
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
concern is about dynamic nature of drugs
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
and dynamic nature of of uh communities
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
right so again as we talk about
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
workforce housing and things that are
 
03:12:05.590 --> 03:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
going on that communities change and
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
people move and and i'm a little
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that at least the 85 percent
 
03:12:12.550 --> 03:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
that can be targeted and focused on our
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
communities that have the most
 
03:12:15.190 --> 03:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
significant problem and as that target
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
moves it can adapt
 
03:12:19.269 --> 03:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
um whereas i'm not sure under the
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
proposed bill that that would do that so
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
can you respond to that and answer that
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh thanks representative lang for
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
that question well just bear in mind
 
03:12:29.190 --> 03:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
that the trust will still have roughly
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
half the funds so i think
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
it does preserve a great deal of
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
resources for whether it's the other
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
communities or a changing landscape as
 
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
you're referring to i think that would
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
be one way
 
03:12:41.750 --> 03:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we can still respond
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
in other in other ways
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in sullivan county we're
 
03:12:48.550 --> 03:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
we're establishing the first uh recovery
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
housing facility in the county uh we're
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
probably just about a month away from
 
03:12:54.710 --> 03:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
cutting the ribbon on that um that's
 
03:12:56.710 --> 03:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
going to be a 30-year commitment for us
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
based on the financing that we had to do
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
to put in place for that project that's
 
03:13:02.229 --> 03:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
one example just for our county
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
of of um
 
03:13:05.670 --> 03:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
of the commitment that will extend
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
beyond this 18-year settlement that we
 
03:13:09.750 --> 03:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
hope to have some of these funds provide
 
03:13:12.389 --> 03:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
additional programs that will be offered
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
as far as the changing landscape of
 
03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:22.070 align:start position:0%
as far as the changing landscape of
drugs

03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
this is an opioid related settlement so
 
03:13:27.110 --> 03:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
the dollars are laid out by statute what
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
the eligible purposes are so even if
 
03:13:30.870 --> 03:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's a new drug that we haven't
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
conceived of yet or if it's
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
in response to meth or bath salts or
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think those are kind of two separate
 
03:13:39.190 --> 03:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
issues i don't know that the trust
 
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
commission would adopt or amend its
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
rules to address those other
 
03:13:45.830 --> 03:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
contingencies but i will say and this is
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
another point that we haven't talked
 
03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
about a lot there is a reporting
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's already established in
 
03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
the original legislation
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
every year the 23 entities that receive
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
funds have to report back to the
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:14:00.309 --> 03:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
how those funds were used
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
dhhs in turn has to provide an annual
 
03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
report i believe it ends up at the
 
03:14:06.870 --> 03:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office among others
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
i would think that as part of that
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
accountability process there could be a
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
way to say well look
 
03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county or sullivan county
 
03:14:16.710 --> 03:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
we don't like how they're using their
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
funds we don't think they're being used
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the law
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
we think that they're you know
 
03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
they're just
 
03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're being frivolous with those funds
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
there should be an accountability
 
03:14:28.950 --> 03:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism and i hope that there would be
 
03:14:30.710 --> 03:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
such that an if entity didn't need the
 
03:14:32.469 --> 03:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
money they wouldn't take it but that's
 
03:14:34.469 --> 03:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
an individual matter i would think for
 
03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
each of the 23 entities and how the
 
03:14:37.520 --> 03:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
each of the 23 entities and how the
commission

03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
the department and the attorney
 
03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
general's office decides to deal with
 
03:14:43.830 --> 03:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
the data that they receive from those
 
03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
annual reports about how the funds were
 
03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:46.790 align:start position:0%
annual reports about how the funds were
spent

03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
spent
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
the law currently is silent on what
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
happens if there's considered to be a
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
violation um that the the money was
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
spent not in accordance with the uh
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
the programs as laid out so
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the what the recourse
 
03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
but i think that there's a mechanism in
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
place to at least open the aperture and
 
03:15:07.110 --> 03:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about the funds
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
being used appropriately or
 
03:15:10.950 --> 03:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriately as the case may be
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:15:20.309 --> 03:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
represent ames
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah um so
 
03:15:25.030 --> 03:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
under the present system
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:30.790 --> 03:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
those that
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
were are part of the 23
 
03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.990 --> 03:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the money
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
will be available
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
to applicants
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
who will apply
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the process that we've heard
 
03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
about that's being set up
 
03:15:51.190 --> 03:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's the way i understand it so in
 
03:15:53.590 --> 03:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
your case
 
03:15:56.309 --> 03:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
sullivan county will get a piece of the
 
03:15:56.319 --> 03:15:58.309 align:start position:0%
sullivan county will get a piece of the
15

03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then it's eligible
 
03:16:02.550 --> 03:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
to apply
 
03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
for a piece of that 85 percent
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
and if
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
the application is solid and
 
03:16:11.279 --> 03:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
the application is solid and
the

03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
um identification of reasons for
 
03:16:16.640 --> 03:16:18.309 align:start position:0%
um identification of reasons for
needing

03:16:18.309 --> 03:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
needing
 
03:16:21.429 --> 03:16:21.439 align:start position:0%
a larger slice of that 85 percent
 
03:16:23.349 --> 03:16:23.359 align:start position:0%
are stated there are more deaths or
 
03:16:23.359 --> 03:16:25.830 align:start position:0%
are stated there are more deaths or
whatever

03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:16:27.190 --> 03:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
sullivan county will then get
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
more money above the allocation that got
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the first instance
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
and i i wonder why
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
we would want to freeze in
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
to place not only that 15 but 40 percent
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
03:16:45.920 --> 03:16:46.870 align:start position:0%
going forward
um

03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
that is based on
 
03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:50.150 align:start position:0%
that is based on
uh

03:16:50.150 --> 03:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:16:52.790 --> 03:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
the filing or lack of filing
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
of uh of
 
03:16:57.910 --> 03:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
complaint complaints by council that are
 
03:17:00.070 --> 03:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
not charging anything
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
but does take some time to respond to
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
questions produce produce data i
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:08.710 --> 03:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
why we would
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
set up that forever system or until
 
03:17:16.870 --> 03:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:19.830 --> 03:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
in place of a system that will
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
enable grants to be issued based on
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
the application the merit of an
 
03:17:25.200 --> 03:17:27.750 align:start position:0%
the application the merit of an
application

03:17:27.750 --> 03:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:17:29.190 --> 03:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
in which
 
03:17:32.389 --> 03:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
a sullivan county or a claremont or
 
03:17:32.399 --> 03:17:33.910 align:start position:0%
a sullivan county or a claremont or
manchester

03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
03:17:35.349 --> 03:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh could
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
make its case
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
against all other cases and get a share
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
of the money
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
another way of saying this is why even
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
is a 15 allocation
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
a reasonable thing to freeze into
 
03:17:50.399 --> 03:17:55.510 align:start position:0%
a reasonable thing to freeze into
statute

03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:57.190 --> 03:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question so are you
 
03:17:58.870 --> 03:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
asking me to comment on the
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh well let me let me say why are you
 
03:18:07.510 --> 03:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
pushing for 40 given that context well
 
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
the the 15 percent as as was discussed
 
03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the previous meetings was
 
03:18:14.229 --> 03:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
100 percent arbitrary
 
03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
it was a 70 15 15 allocation model that
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
was suggested by uh the judge in ohio
 
03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
said for the states that are going to
 
03:18:23.429 --> 03:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
set up
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
trusts which they were pushing states to
 
03:18:25.840 --> 03:18:26.630 align:start position:0%
trusts which they were pushing states to
do

03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
as part of the negotiation on the
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
national front they said if the state
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
has a trust and the defendants have
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
assurances that the trust will protect
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
those funds and ensure that they're
 
03:18:37.269 --> 03:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
spent on opioid abatement activities
 
03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
you'll get more money so that was the
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
the rationale behind pushing everybody
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
to establish trust
 
03:18:46.150 --> 03:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
the 70 15 15 was simply a default
 
03:18:46.160 --> 03:18:48.070 align:start position:0%
the 70 15 15 was simply a default
suggestion

03:18:48.070 --> 03:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:49.110 align:start position:0%
suggestion
so

03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:51.190 --> 03:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
i guess based on the data that i
 
03:18:53.910 --> 03:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
presented from the states database
 
03:18:55.269 --> 03:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more rationale that you
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
can defend based on a 40 allocation
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
factor in this bill than there is for
 
03:19:00.870 --> 03:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
the 15
 
03:19:02.550 --> 03:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
certainly if we look at over overdose
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
deaths as the primary metric
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
we should be interested in putting more
 
03:19:08.469 --> 03:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
funds where it's going to have the
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
greatest impact and save the most lives
 
03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
greatest impact and save the most lives
so

03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the rationale pure and
 
03:19:18.389 --> 03:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
simple is to get more funding directly
 
03:19:20.309 --> 03:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
to those communities and not have to
 
03:19:20.319 --> 03:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
to those communities and not have to
wait

03:19:21.110 --> 03:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
wait
 
03:19:24.550 --> 03:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
for weeks and months to submit a grant
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
process have the commission
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
approve it and then have it be further
 
03:19:30.710 --> 03:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and executive
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
council i think it's a matter of
 
03:19:34.950 --> 03:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness and to
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
provide resources directly where the
 
03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
problem is
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that the data substantiate
 
03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:46.309 align:start position:0%
and i think that the data substantiate
that

03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.070 --> 03:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:19:56.790 --> 03:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
um it would there be a difficulty in
 
03:19:56.800 --> 03:19:57.750 align:start position:0%
um it would there be a difficulty in
making

03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
making
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
two pools of money one for the counties
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
and one for the municipalities
 
03:20:07.269 --> 03:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
and not restricting it to a
 
03:20:09.830 --> 03:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
percentage for the municipalities in
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
that way
 
03:20:13.590 --> 03:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
the population is essentially counted
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
twice like you would like
 
03:20:16.160 --> 03:20:17.510 align:start position:0%
twice like you would like
and

03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:20:18.710 --> 03:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
by my
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
rude calculation the counties receive
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of the funding from
 
03:20:26.229 --> 03:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
this mckinsey settlement
 
03:20:29.349 --> 03:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe that's an idea we could
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
toss about to
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
separate the counties and municipalities
 
03:20:35.190 --> 03:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
so you're not competing
 
03:20:36.710 --> 03:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
funding i don't know just an idea
 
03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
thanks uh representative gamarlo uh we
 
03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time coordinating with
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
the 10 counties and the 13
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities that were part of this
 
03:20:50.469 --> 03:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
the overarching concern from the
 
03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities was that any adjustment
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
was going to come at their expense
 
03:20:56.309 --> 03:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
which is what led to this the the
 
03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
process of doing a direct calculation
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
for each entity that way
 
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i know mr buffett alluded that the
 
03:21:04.790 --> 03:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
city of manchester's share would be
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
reduced that's not the case
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
they would get their full share based on
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
their population and the counties get
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
their full share based on their
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
populations the direct calculation
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
method was really the only way that i
 
03:21:15.359 --> 03:21:16.469 align:start position:0%
method was really the only way that i
could

03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
think that would be a reasonable
 
03:21:21.429 --> 03:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
justifiable process and formula
 
03:21:23.510 --> 03:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
even though it does as we've covered
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
result in this mathematical anomaly of
 
03:21:27.190 --> 03:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
double counting
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
i still think that's a less
 
03:21:31.830 --> 03:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
bad outcome than trying to share and get
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
to this 100 percent pie where
 
03:21:36.469 --> 03:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
where the counties are absolutely
 
03:21:36.479 --> 03:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
where the counties are absolutely
penalized

03:21:37.750 --> 03:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
penalized
 
03:21:37.760 --> 03:21:41.670 align:start position:0%
penalized
unfairly

03:21:41.670 --> 03:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.680 --> 03:21:43.590 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
not much of the money has been dispersed
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
and that it sounds like there's going to
 
03:21:53.279 --> 03:21:54.229 align:start position:0%
and that it sounds like there's going to
be

03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:21:56.950 --> 03:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
more settlements as time goes on
 
03:21:56.960 --> 03:21:57.990 align:start position:0%
more settlements as time goes on
and

03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
and to representative lang lang's piece
 
03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
about the shifting
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
complexity of the problem
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
it just seems like
 
03:22:09.510 --> 03:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
due to the population size of those
 
03:22:13.670 --> 03:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
cities they would get
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
what they needed and then so would you
 
03:22:18.790 --> 03:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
know a smaller place up in
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative tucker's area
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
it seems like we should put aside that
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
these 13 municipalities had a problem
 
03:22:29.269 --> 03:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
now more and more other
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
more and more other municipalities do
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
and we should just share it there's
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to be enough to go around in
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:45.190 --> 03:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
my perspective
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
so you said 70 15 15. okay i'm a little
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
thick so
 
03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
the 85 gets split
 
03:23:00.710 --> 03:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
to 70 15 and the other 15 we understand
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
you said seven what is the other 15 oh
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
that yes you're talking the default
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
model the 70 15 15 was 70 percent to the
 
03:23:10.950 --> 03:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
trust 15 to the state 15 to the entities
 
03:23:13.190 --> 03:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
that sued uh mr buffett mentioned that
 
03:23:15.510 --> 03:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the state dumped its portion into with
 
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
the 70s so the 85 is the 70 and the 15.
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
right so that was the ohio that was
 
03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
there the judge's recommendation but we
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
didn't follow that we just well we did
 
03:23:26.309 --> 03:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
but the state then decided to put its
 
03:23:28.630 --> 03:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
share into the the trust pot got it
 
03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
saying none then i'm going to close the
 
03:23:41.790 --> 03:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
work session on house bill
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
1565 and we'll be
 
03:23:44.479 --> 03:23:46.309 align:start position:0%
1565 and we'll be
attending

03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
attending
 
03:23:49.110 --> 03:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
going back to the work session next week
 
03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
saying that it's 12 30
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take a break for lunch
 
03:23:59.120 --> 03:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take a break for lunch
in

03:23:59.830 --> 03:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
45 minutes and we'll be back here at
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.309 --> 04:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open the works session on
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairman major and
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for having
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
me today
 
04:18:03.040 --> 04:18:04.149 align:start position:0%
me today
uh

04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
i've been working with my colleague tom
 
04:18:09.670 --> 04:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
prasall and uh he was keeping me updated
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
from the um from the session last week
 
04:18:12.960 --> 04:18:13.830 align:start position:0%
from the um from the session last week
that

04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh it might be helpful to make myself
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
available today to the committee if
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
there are any questions uh on the rental
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
car fleet
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire by number of locations
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
or a number of overall vehicles
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
or to make myself additionally available

customers that that the car rental
 
04:18:41.590 --> 04:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
industry sees so i just wanted to

and make myself available for any
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions relative to the car rental
 
04:18:52.550 --> 04:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
industry that may help you as you
 
04:18:56.790 --> 04:18:56.800 align:start position:0%

representative romney
 
04:19:01.030 --> 04:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
so i know some data was handed out
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
last week
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
or stated anyway
 
04:19:07.439 --> 04:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
or stated anyway
that

04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot more
 
04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
local people
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
renting cars
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
than out of staters
 
04:19:20.309 --> 04:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i said well i asked well where'd the
 
04:19:23.349 --> 04:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
data come from they said from enterprise
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
so but i know enterprise has a kind of
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
unique model i mean you're you you have
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
you have offices everywhere and you your
 
04:19:32.790 --> 04:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
model is to do
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
the local stuff i mean
 
04:19:37.750 --> 04:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
when you deal with car dealerships that
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
they have and i've
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
i've experienced that
 
04:19:45.189 --> 04:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
they'll pick you up and they you get the
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork and then when you come back
 
04:19:48.630 --> 04:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
they'll drop you back home
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
so yes your date is going to show that
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more local
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
i i have to be convinced that's that's
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
my my feeling is that that's not the
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
case with the others avis you know hurts
 
04:20:02.880 --> 04:20:03.830 align:start position:0%
case with the others avis you know hurts
whatever

04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:20:05.590 --> 04:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
so can you add some clarity to that
 
04:20:05.600 --> 04:20:06.389 align:start position:0%
so can you add some clarity to that
please

04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to thank you
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes the the data um
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
that that that was probably shared with
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
you was enterprises data but to give
 
04:20:17.830 --> 04:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
some contrast and as you referenced as
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
we've spoken earlier about your
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
experience you know renting from the the
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
enterprise in exeter
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh our largest uh you know the one of
 
04:20:28.070 --> 04:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
the other largest rental car companies
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
is hertz and if you
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
looked at hertz's locations in new
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire they have nine locations i
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
hope that's correct i i did an internet
 
04:20:38.560 --> 04:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
hope that's correct i i did an internet
search

04:20:39.510 --> 04:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
search
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
last week they have nine locations in
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
whereas the enterprise model has been
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
successful of servicing the local towns
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
and cities it's a successful model
 
04:20:52.830 --> 04:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
overall for the industry of hertz's nine
 
04:20:55.349 --> 04:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
locations uh their only one that's at an
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
airport uh is the one at manchester um
 
04:21:01.110 --> 04:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
so they have eight locations uh you know
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
between salem uh manchester off airport
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
northampton laconia nashua glenn keane
 
04:21:10.389 --> 04:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
and claremont so
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know of the nine locations i
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what their associated fleet
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
sizes at each location are vis-a-vis
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
their location at manchester uh but i
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
can speak to enterprises and over the
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
last 12 months the enterprise rental car
 
04:21:25.910 --> 04:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
fleet in new hampshire has been
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 3 500 vehicles
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
we have 34 locations across the state of
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
and only one airport location which
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
predominantly services uh out of out of
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
state uh you know customers
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
um our fleet at manchester airport is
 
04:21:47.750 --> 04:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
400 vehicles so for 400 vehicles so of
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
our 3 500 vehicles that we operate
 
04:21:53.269 --> 04:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
04:21:55.110 --> 04:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
i wasn't a math major but i think that's
 
04:21:57.189 --> 04:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
around 12 percent maybe a little bit
 
04:21:57.199 --> 04:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
around 12 percent maybe a little bit
less

04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh is is at an airport location and if
 
04:22:01.600 --> 04:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
uh is is at an airport location and if
you

04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
were to look a little bit deeper and
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
peel the onion back a little bit a
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have 116 vehicles at our hookset
 
04:22:10.880 --> 04:22:12.550 align:start position:0%
we have 116 vehicles at our hookset
location

04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
location
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
150 vehicles at the keane location
 
04:22:17.279 --> 04:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
150 vehicles at the keane location

04:22:20.469 --> 04:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
you know those are local residents you
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%

04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
very rarely i would assume would get to
 
04:22:23.920 --> 04:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
very rarely i would assume would get to
keen

04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
keen
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know into new hampshire get to keene
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%

uh
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
do others have the same relationship
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
you guys do with
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
all of the auto dealerships for
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%

replacement cars while cars are being
repaired

04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
repaired
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
can't speak for all of them uh
 
04:23:27.110 --> 04:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
avis and budget
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
they do have some home city is what what
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
the industry calls the off airport
 
04:23:35.110 --> 04:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
locations but hertz uh maybe about 20
 
04:23:36.550 --> 04:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh their branding is called hertz local
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
edition and the we we compete for the
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
same type of customers with the
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
dealership uh you know the dealerships
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
to to use us when their customers need
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh in effect the loaner vehicle and then
 
04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
also with the major you know the
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
insurance companies when in the event
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
there's an automobile accident to
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
provide transfer replacement

04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
so is it
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like if it's a good percentage
 
04:24:07.110 --> 04:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
of your business
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
that the car dealership or the insurance
 
04:24:12.309 --> 04:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
company is actually paying
 
04:24:12.319 --> 04:24:13.110 align:start position:0%
company is actually paying
the

04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:24:15.189 --> 04:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
cost of the vehicle plus the tax is that
 
04:24:15.199 --> 04:24:16.149 align:start position:0%
cost of the vehicle plus the tax is that
correct

04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would in most circumstances yes
 
04:24:20.469 --> 04:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
that would be correct
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:24:29.830 --> 04:24:29.840 align:start position:0%

vermont

04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%

and of the three states is it just one
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
simple tax or does it vary
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
it varies the tax rate varies across
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%

04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:25:06.000 --> 04:25:07.030 align:start position:0%
yes
thanks

04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
follow up on that follow up so let's
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
talk about that
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i traveled just about every state
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
in the country when my job for over
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
for years
 
04:25:15.840 --> 04:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
for years
and

04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
the eight and a half percent is a
 
04:25:18.080 --> 04:25:19.189 align:start position:0%
the eight and a half percent is a
bargain

04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
bargain
 
04:25:20.790 --> 04:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
to me
 
04:25:23.429 --> 04:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
you go to most airports and they tech on
 
04:25:25.590 --> 04:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
they take on all these other fees
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:25:28.790 --> 04:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
battery replacement fee
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
tire you know i mean it's unbelievable
 
04:25:31.439 --> 04:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
tire you know i mean it's unbelievable
sometimes

04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
what you pay for the car rental equals
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
what you're paying taxes and fees it's
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
equal to the rental cost itself
 
04:25:40.000 --> 04:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
equal to the rental cost itself
so

04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:25:45.030 --> 04:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
would you agree that we're a bargain in
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
terms of our tax rate
 
04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and uh it's
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more complex than a yes
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
or no that it's a bargain when you fly
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
to an airport there's
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally concession fees and very
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know what you see on a rental
 
04:26:07.590 --> 04:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
agreement receipt if you run it at an
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
airport across the country
 
04:26:11.429 --> 04:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
there there will be different concession
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
fees airport access fees that are the
 
04:26:16.550 --> 04:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
cost of being a concessionaire
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
at the airport
 
04:26:20.950 --> 04:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
the the overall tax rate
 
04:26:20.960 --> 04:26:24.309 align:start position:0%
the the overall tax rate
um

04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
it's about new hampshire's about middle
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
middle of the pack it's it's not the
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
worst but it's not the lowest tax rate
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh but but to your point if you just
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:26:37.189 --> 04:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
which many of you all which many of you
 
04:26:39.349 --> 04:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
may do when you when you do travel out
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
of state you'll see a an itemized
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
receipt at the airport that looks very
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
different uh in most states
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
comparatively to if you rented from one
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:26:48.479 --> 04:26:49.429 align:start position:0%
of the
local

04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
enterprise locations or carbon locations
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
in your in your town where you live if
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
you if you rent it at an airport
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair may follow
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
just just
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
the worst was san francisco
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
they have the shuttle train that goes
 
04:27:03.359 --> 04:27:04.870 align:start position:0%
they have the shuttle train that goes
around

04:27:04.870 --> 04:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:27:04.880 --> 04:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
around
and

04:27:05.750 --> 04:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
the last stop is the car rental
 
04:27:07.680 --> 04:27:08.790 align:start position:0%
the last stop is the car rental
places

04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
places
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
25 bucks
 
04:27:10.720 --> 04:27:11.429 align:start position:0%
25 bucks
and

04:27:11.429 --> 04:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
i i actually questioned that fee one day
 
04:27:15.189 --> 04:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
and she said well it used to be like
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
five bucks
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
but but the sam but san francisco proper
 
04:27:20.710 --> 04:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
puts that tax on that
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it and it's like every they're
 
04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
looking for money they just keep on
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
raising that that tax let's
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
let's get to taurus i mean let's get to
 
04:27:30.790 --> 04:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
travelers i mean that's what it is we
 
04:27:32.070 --> 04:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that philosophy in new
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire you know it's straight tax
 
04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't allow
 
04:27:38.870 --> 04:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
these add-ons but i guess there's really
 
04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.670 --> 04:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
i have one further question if the tax
 
04:27:50.229 --> 04:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
was removed
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
would you be renting more cars
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.720 --> 04:28:00.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:28:00.070 --> 04:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
represent malloy mr chair thank you
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
this is a maybe a question for the group
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
and clarification did we not pass a
 
04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh attacks on ride-sharing
 
04:28:11.680 --> 04:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
uh attacks on ride-sharing
companies

04:28:13.110 --> 04:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:28:14.710 --> 04:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:28:17.189 --> 04:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
last year we did okay
 
04:28:18.870 --> 04:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:28:21.110 --> 04:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
but it so would this would this bill
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
apply to the ride sharing companies as
 
04:28:24.870 --> 04:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
well because it just says
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh rentals of generally rentals of motor
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
vehicles and
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
would there need to be a specific
 
04:28:32.080 --> 04:28:32.870 align:start position:0%
would there need to be a specific
uh

04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
codicil in here that refers to ride
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
sharing and all the other
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.800 --> 04:28:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
king

04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for my taking my
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you committee
 
04:28:54.479 --> 04:28:59.269 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you committee
members

04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.279 --> 04:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.149 --> 04:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
guy from enterprise would you fill out a
 
04:29:05.269 --> 04:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
pink card
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
kane the question is
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
is the tax
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles rental
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
as well as the right shares
 
04:29:27.680 --> 04:29:45.110 align:start position:0%
as well as the right shares
vehicles

04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.710 --> 04:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
main one from the department of revenue
 
04:29:49.110 --> 04:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
so um from my understanding is looking
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
at the uh the current bill it removes
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
the reference to renter
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh from the bill and um
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be honest i have not looked into the
 
04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
the right sharing but then i do have a
 
04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
note here that when i was researching
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
this that the definition of renter would
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
mean any persons who for
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
any for consideration paid to another is
 
04:30:14.630 --> 04:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
provided a vehicle and rental agreement
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
so if this renter here applies to the
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
right sharing
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
business so then removing this
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
reference to renter will remove uh
 
04:30:28.950 --> 04:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
the tax from that as well
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
this is all repealed mental facilitator
 
04:30:31.279 --> 04:30:32.309 align:start position:0%
this is all repealed mental facilitator
and

04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:38.149 --> 04:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
well no yes
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
it is it's in the bill okay yeah right
 
04:30:40.239 --> 04:30:41.349 align:start position:0%
it is it's in the bill okay yeah right
yeah

04:30:41.349 --> 04:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:30:46.229 --> 04:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:30:50.389 --> 04:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
represent almei
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:55.590 --> 04:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out when you're
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
looking at section two
 
04:30:58.159 --> 04:31:00.149 align:start position:0%
looking at section two
collection

04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
collection
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
they're removing rental from everywhere
 
04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
but we are also a hotel tax
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
but does this need to be rewritten if we
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
were going to pass this to
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's clear that we're
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
my apologies are represented army um so
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
you're referring to line
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
six onwards
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
section two out of collection
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the question is no because certain
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
things that are rented are the cars
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's what has taken the renters out
 
04:32:06.720 --> 04:32:07.750 align:start position:0%
that's what has taken the renters out
so

04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:10.149 --> 04:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
so occupant would be the hotel yeah so
 
04:32:13.750 --> 04:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
occupant is clearly in the definitions
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
the hotels right yes
 
04:32:19.030 --> 04:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
so that's not being removed that's still
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the yeah that's my understanding yes
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative spellsbury
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman i do think
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
we should just check the statute to be
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
certain of ourselves but my recollection
 
04:32:33.830 --> 04:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
of hb
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
was that
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
rental was the classification
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
specifically for the cars and rental
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
facilitator is what we were and what we
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
did in hp 15 is amend definitions
 
04:32:44.239 --> 04:32:46.469 align:start position:0%
did in hp 15 is amend definitions
primarily

04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
primarily
 
04:32:46.479 --> 04:32:47.670 align:start position:0%
primarily
so

04:32:47.670 --> 04:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:49.590 --> 04:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
this probably suffices but we should be
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
sure right we should and what this does
 
04:32:55.110 --> 04:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
is it just strikes out rental it keeps
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
it keeps the rental which is the cars so
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
we we should double check it i guess
 
04:32:59.520 --> 04:33:00.389 align:start position:0%
we we should double check it i guess
yeah

04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:33:02.309 --> 04:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
good point
 
04:33:02.319 --> 04:33:03.349 align:start position:0%
good point
representative

04:33:03.349 --> 04:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i believe it says on line 11
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
that the tax on meals and rooms is
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
included for the cost of meals and
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
lodging only
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
so that if we were talking about
 
04:33:16.070 --> 04:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
occupants or whatever i believe i
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
believe it stated in here that that
 
04:33:17.279 --> 04:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
believe it stated in here that that
stays

04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
representative tucker
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding is listening to
 
04:33:28.320 --> 04:33:29.670 align:start position:0%
my understanding is listening to
enterprise

04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
we should eliminate the tax
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
because it's used by local people
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
the cars are being rented by locals
 
04:33:43.429 --> 04:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
rather than out of states but i don't
 
04:33:45.269 --> 04:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
see that this applies when i go to the
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
grocery store
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
and buy a prepared meal
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
i imagine most of the supermarkets that
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
sell prepared meals
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
that get charged
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
meals tax they're probably local people
 
04:34:02.310 --> 04:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
too and we're not suggesting that
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
we should eliminate the tax on that
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand why it is that
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of state or in-state or local
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.400 --> 04:34:17.109 align:start position:0%
 
it

04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's just inconsistent i go to the
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
polish princess at lancaster
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
and buy an apple dumpling i'm
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
charged uh meals tax on that
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
most of the people who go to the bakery
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're local people so it isn't a
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
criteria here
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
to consider out of state in the state as
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
as an important factor i just don't
 
04:34:42.240 --> 04:34:43.429 align:start position:0%
as an important factor i just don't
understand

04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:50.639 --> 04:34:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
represented

04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think at the
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
time that we put in the car rental tax
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
which we were both involved in
 
04:35:03.199 --> 04:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
which we were both involved in
accepting

04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
accepting
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
in the poo-poo platter that did the
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:16.879 --> 04:35:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:35:18.470 --> 04:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:35:19.590 --> 04:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
it was
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
it was put in at that time think we were
 
04:35:24.470 --> 04:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
still thinking that most of the rooms
 
04:35:26.470 --> 04:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
and mails tax was on
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%

04:35:28.639 --> 04:35:29.910 align:start position:0%

04:35:29.920 --> 04:35:30.789 align:start position:0%

uh

04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:33.189 --> 04:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
but that since then there have been
 
04:35:33.199 --> 04:35:35.029 align:start position:0%
but that since then there have been
studies

04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
studies
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
on by plymouth state and i think the dra
 
04:35:40.400 --> 04:35:41.349 align:start position:0%
on by plymouth state and i think the dra
data

04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
data
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
on showing for instance the percentage
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
of the meals tax that comes from fast
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
food restaurants which usually isn't

tourists
that

04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
indicated that we were
 
04:35:58.150 --> 04:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
and also during the great recession
 
04:35:58.160 --> 04:36:01.429 align:start position:0%
and also during the great recession
we

04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.439 --> 04:36:02.390 align:start position:0%
 
lost

04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
lost
 
04:36:02.400 --> 04:36:05.189 align:start position:0%
lost
a

04:36:05.189 --> 04:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
fair amount of rooms and meals at first
 
04:36:09.990 --> 04:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think but we lost
 
04:36:10.000 --> 04:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
i think but we lost
uh

04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
a lot less than we were expecting and it
 
04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
was because the local people were used
 
04:36:19.109 --> 04:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
to eating out and were still trying to
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
eat out at the fast food places
 
04:36:21.600 --> 04:36:26.070 align:start position:0%
eat out at the fast food places
so

04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we are with this taxing mostly
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
tourists we're taxing ourselves
 
04:36:35.119 --> 04:36:37.109 align:start position:0%
tourists we're taxing ourselves
uh

04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:39.750 --> 04:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
on in general
 
04:36:42.230 --> 04:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
devon not as much in the rooms do you
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%

reading out
 
04:37:01.680 --> 04:37:06.390 align:start position:0%
reading out
okay

04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to if you don't mind circle
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
back to the question about the
 
04:37:11.429 --> 04:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
definition of renter yes
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%

sorry what was the question
 
04:37:45.510 --> 04:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
this is occupant which is hotels
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%

representative lang sorry i do have one
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
more question with d.r.a robertson go
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
ahead sorry i just want to make sure
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
that the revenue
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
differential is around seven million
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
dollars is that we're talking about
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
annually if we're to repeal just this
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:53.349 --> 04:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal note based on fy 21
 
04:38:56.719 --> 04:38:58.310 align:start position:0%

04:38:58.310 --> 04:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
and assuming uh in you know
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
factoring in the eight and a half
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
percent rate that was passed last year
 
04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
the total
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.150 --> 04:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:23.910 --> 04:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
is house house bill 1450
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
an act including agricultural resources
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
under the lantern community heritage
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments
 
04:39:46.868 --> 04:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
i had a comment represent tucker yes
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
i received a note from
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
the new head of el chip
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
paula belmore
 
04:39:56.708 --> 04:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
and she apparently had been watching the
 
04:39:58.470 --> 04:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
streamed version
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
and heard me say that i would find out
 
04:40:00.798 --> 04:40:01.830 align:start position:0%
and heard me say that i would find out
about

04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:40:03.510 --> 04:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
land trusts
 
04:40:03.520 --> 04:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
land trusts
that

04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
have agricultural interests
 
04:40:08.400 --> 04:40:09.190 align:start position:0%
have agricultural interests
and

04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:12.150 --> 04:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
although the computer program was down
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
at that particular moment
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
she assured me that yes most land trusts
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
do have
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to save agricultural lands
 
04:40:24.550 --> 04:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
she did agree
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
that the definitions
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
of what is agricultural whether it would
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
include being a working
 
04:40:31.440 --> 04:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
include being a working
farm

04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
farm
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
all of those questions
 
04:40:37.990 --> 04:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
may vary how they're answered land trust
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
to land trust and those are complicated
 
04:40:40.718 --> 04:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
to land trust and those are complicated
questions

04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:40:41.840 --> 04:40:42.948 align:start position:0%
questions
but

04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:40:44.868 --> 04:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
she did feel that there were
 
04:40:44.878 --> 04:40:46.390 align:start position:0%
she did feel that there were
other

04:40:46.390 --> 04:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:40:46.400 --> 04:40:47.350 align:start position:0%
other
groups

04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
groups
 
04:40:49.590 --> 04:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
that were very interested and were
 
04:40:51.110 --> 04:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
active in
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh agricultural resource uh preservation
 
04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that was what i'd agreed to find out
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.708 --> 04:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
represent elmi
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and i and i don't know which
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
others but i was told that they'd
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
contacted several other people on the
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee heard from the head of the
 
04:41:16.230 --> 04:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
forest society
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
and the head of the nature conservancy
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday they called me up i called the
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
forest society
 
04:41:31.190 --> 04:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
guy back and discussed it with him
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
and they both
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
felt that they would be much more
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this bill being itled
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
and the reason was that they are
 
04:41:44.708 --> 04:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
attempts in the past to remove the
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
l-chip funding or severely reduce it
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that they would rather be going on
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
with what they've got now and not risk
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
looking too greedy
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
essentially that's what they were saying
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
and they represented what
 
04:42:04.080 --> 04:42:05.270 align:start position:0%
and they represented what
the

04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:07.450 --> 04:42:07.460 align:start position:0%
new hampshire society for the
 
04:42:07.460 --> 04:42:09.590 align:start position:0%
new hampshire society for the
[Music]

04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
protection of new hampshire forests
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the nature conservancy new hampshire
 
04:42:16.000 --> 04:42:20.390 align:start position:0%
and the nature conservancy new hampshire
branch

04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative lang representative
 
04:42:26.948 --> 04:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
so i i happen to agree i think the
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
l-chip program is an extremely well
 
04:42:31.670 --> 04:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
targeted program that's been extremely
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh successful and functional and in
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
protecting both our open lands as well
 
04:42:38.070 --> 04:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
as our historical buildings and i think
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
expanding this puts it at risk
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
or increased risk and i would wholly
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
represented tucker
 
04:42:54.708 --> 04:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
i also heard from the nature conservancy
 
04:42:54.718 --> 04:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
i also heard from the nature conservancy
and

04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
we discussed at some length
 
04:42:58.080 --> 04:42:59.190 align:start position:0%
we discussed at some length
the

04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:01.990 --> 04:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
saving of three percent of the land
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
mass of new hampshire some years ago
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
on the predecessor l-chip and at that
 
04:43:07.840 --> 04:43:08.788 align:start position:0%
on the predecessor l-chip and at that
time

04:43:08.788 --> 04:43:08.798 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
in order to save the lands around
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh the old champion lands
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of money
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
was spent on one project and that had
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
the negative effect
 
04:43:20.400 --> 04:43:21.430 align:start position:0%
the negative effect
of

04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
shutting down
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
what became l-chip
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
for a year or two
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
these are delicate balances in which the
 
04:43:33.750 --> 04:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
public supports what's being done now
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
because of its great success
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
but that's always a jeopardy
 
04:43:40.550 --> 04:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you change it too much
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
and you allowed any kind of greed to
 
04:43:48.150 --> 04:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
appear on the on the horizon so i agree
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
with representative lang
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
further comment
 
04:43:52.480 --> 04:43:55.430 align:start position:0%
further comment
questions

04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
i see nothing else so
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
the work session on house bill
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
1450 is over
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:12.868 --> 04:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
relative to the business profits tax
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
applicable to certain large low-wage
 
04:44:17.440 --> 04:44:28.470 align:start position:0%
applicable to certain large low-wage
employees

04:44:28.470 --> 04:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
questions or comments additional
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
information needed representation yeah
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
again i i'm not sure what additional
 
04:44:36.868 --> 04:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
information needed uh
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
at best it's questionably constitutional
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
at worst it is definitely
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um and and
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
again i i think this is an end around
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
that belongs over in the labor committee
 
04:44:50.470 --> 04:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's an attempt to
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage laws um that belongs in the
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
wholly in the policy domain of labor so
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.470 --> 04:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
mr chair um for other comments yeah
 
04:45:08.480 --> 04:45:10.230 align:start position:0%
mr chair um for other comments yeah
representative

04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
we did pass this which i i don't think
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
we are but i hope not
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
i mean how
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
totally unworkable i mean how do you
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to dra is going to
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of companies with 100
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
or more people or less people and then
 
04:45:26.470 --> 04:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
they have to keep track of the average
 
04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
salary being 15
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%

04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
above or 15 an hour
 
04:45:31.760 --> 04:45:33.110 align:start position:0%
above or 15 an hour
below

04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
below
 
04:45:35.190 --> 04:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
it's an impossible task for dra you may
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
want to ask them to comment on that but
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
um that's my view i don't know how this
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
how can you how can this
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
even work
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay without adding a cast of thousands
 
04:45:49.030 --> 04:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
in dra to make it work
 
04:45:52.310 --> 04:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
straw poll
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
i knew it was never going to fly but
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
again i thought the conversation needed
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
to be had and i have a friend that works
 
04:46:21.200 --> 04:46:22.948 align:start position:0%
to be had and i have a friend that works
for

04:46:22.948 --> 04:46:22.958 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
hhs and i called her
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
while we were
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
caucusing and said how often do you get
 
04:46:31.040 --> 04:46:32.230 align:start position:0%
caucusing and said how often do you get
clients

04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
clients
 
04:46:33.990 --> 04:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
that are looking for benefits that work
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
for these large companies and she said i
 
04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
had two from walmart today said i'm on
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
the call still with one of them so it's
 
04:46:42.390 --> 04:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
just something that
 
04:46:44.150 --> 04:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
i think we should be enlightened about
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
that happens that we're subsidizing
 
04:46:48.550 --> 04:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
people that these corporations could
 
04:46:50.550 --> 04:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
very well take care of
 
04:46:54.550 --> 04:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my piece thank you
 
04:46:57.750 --> 04:46:57.760 align:start position:0%

representative
 
04:47:04.150 --> 04:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree with that but i think
 
04:47:06.628 --> 04:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
that there's a much clearer
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
there must be a clearer way to write a
 
04:47:19.830 --> 04:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
