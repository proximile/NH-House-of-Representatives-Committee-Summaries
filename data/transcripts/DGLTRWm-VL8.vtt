we don't need a roll
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
call this is uh this for I usually don't
 
00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:33.879 align:start position:0%
call a roll call for the hearing uh
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
much all right could you could you

okay talk right inway that
 
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
better all right so the board consists
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
of 10 municipalities and organizations
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
that send their sewage to the program's
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
Regional treatment plant in Franklin the
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
regional collection system in the
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
treatment plant is operated in Hampshire
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
Department environmental services and
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
the advisory board's main function is to
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
review the capital Improvement program
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
review the contracts to plan design and
 
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
constructive Capital Improvements that
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
require approval by the governor and
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
executive councel and to review the
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
program's budget 10 member communities
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
pay all costs associated with the
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance of the system
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
the only state funds the program
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
receives are from Grants and loans that
 
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
any sewage treatment plant can receive
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
in the state there have been no major
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
changes to the systems cost distribution
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
plan since the 1980s when the uh system
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
began operations the board its member
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
communities and the program
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
administrator have been working for
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
several years on changes to the funding
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
model to reflect more
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
closely the the current usage of the
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
system of by the member communities and
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
organizations the reason why this is
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
necessary is Municipal growth rates do
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
not reflect what they were predicting
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
back into the 1980s we have found that
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
water consumption changes
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
water consumption itself is dropping due
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
to changes in the more efficient systems
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
that you find in homes and the
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance and repair of the municipal
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
old own system varies between
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
communities the members are build to
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
support costs of four functions the
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
methods for updating the distribution of
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
costs or three of the four functions can
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
be updated without any change to the
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
existing laws the fourth the replacement
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
fund can only be updated through
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
legislation the replacement fund is the
 
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:04.839 align:start position:0%
account the Department of Environmental
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
Services uses to fund the cost of
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
unanticipated repairs that cost between
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
that cost more than they can be funded
 
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
through the operation maintenance
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
account and they're really less than you
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
you do with a bond so it's in that
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
spot presently the cost or repairs
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
funded through the replacement fund are
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
distributed to member communities based
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
on their use of that portion of the
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
system that failed the impacted
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to pay back
 
00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
that fund the cost of those repairs over
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
10 years the proposed change approved by
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
the member communities will have the
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%

Anderson Mr
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
chair yeah first I wanted to comment
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
that I can hear this are you hearing me
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
through a speaker okay the gentleman who
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
just testified I did not hear him
 
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
through my speaker and it didn't sound
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
like the mic was working all that well
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if it's just you have to
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
get closer or is the red and everyone
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
should know the red light has to be on
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
for you to be able to hear people
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
through the speaker um but the question
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
I have for you um Mr Anderson is the um
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
I might have missed this but the the uh
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
in quite a few places like on line 13 of
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
the bill it changed total fund to Total
 
00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:54.990 align:start position:0%

fund
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
capital and I wondered uh the reason for
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
that change
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%

be tasked with
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
you the contrast between
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
servicing Environmental Services versus
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection I would suggest
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
to you is similar to the the difference
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
between the words may and shall May
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
grants you a little bit of latitude to
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
do something shall means you're going to
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
do something and that's the distinction
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
I think from looking at Environmental
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
Services to Environmental Protection I
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
think historically when Dees was first
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
approved back in the 80s it was a brand
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
new agency just for the lack of a better
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
term getting getting their feet wet and
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
here we are in
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
2022 you know the state of New Hampshire
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
is probably faced with the most
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
compelling challenge that we're we're
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to face over not
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
just my generation or your grandkids
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
generation but I would suggest maybe
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
your great great grandkids generation
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be making sure that
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
the air especially our water and the
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
soil remains as pristine as possible
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
that will allow New Hampshire to
 
00:53:58.990 --> 00:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
continue to provide the quality of life
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
and grow and flourish
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
now Dees I can say with a fair degree of
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainty having served on The Drinking
 
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.190 align:start position:0%
certainty having served on The Drinking
Water

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
Water
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
Commission the individuals along with
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
the commissioner from top to bottom they
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
are committed they're qualified they're
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
competent and they're absolutely F
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
mission focused on trying to deliver the
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
best possible that Dees can provide as
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
it relates to Environmental Quality in
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
our St state but changing the name from
 
00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
services to protection means pivoting
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
the mission it doesn't necessarily mean
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be confusing people
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
with what de Dees is already doing I
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
would suggest to you that changing the
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
name to protection only amplifies
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
amplifies our mission and highlights the
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
fact that this is a state that remains a
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
tourist state that provides people 4,000
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
foot mountains to hike trails to paramet
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
beaches to visit Forest to to to go play
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
in I mean I don't mean to sound polanish
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
to my colleagues but New Hampshire has
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to provide outdoor
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
amenities to the people that come to New
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and believe in what New
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is offering them not if you're
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
visiting as a tourist but also for those
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
that reside here in terms of quality
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
life issues so I would to contend to you
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
that the name change is is Phil I will
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
suggest it is philosophical and I think
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
we're at this particular point that a
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
name change from a philosophical
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
perspective is going to be necessary
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
considering the issues that this state
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
has begun to deal with most specifically
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
as it relates to propo and other
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
contaminants that are permeating the air
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
the water and the
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
soil as it relates to the the PIV the
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
private drinking
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
Wells the reason why that was added to
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
the bill is I have my my father-in-law
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
my father Law's neighbor um received a
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
letter from Dees was well put together
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the groundwater contamination
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
notification program and they reached
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
out to
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
roughly 103 private well owners um
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
amorist Hollis Bedford Londoner meramac
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
P in in their private
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
Wells all of these homeowners are
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
outside the decree that Dees negotiated
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
with sang go Bain as it relates to the
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
to the to the pollution problem that
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
they did as it relates to marac Villa
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
District Wells four and
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
five these private these these private
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
Wells the notification program Dees has
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
kindly sent these individuals a letter
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
basically explain we've tested you Wells
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
and it's Ted with
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
pooa goes on in the letter that says New
 
00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has limited resources
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
available to sample private
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
Wells you can submit a d you can submit
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
a request to have you all sampled by you
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
know by DS or you can have have it done
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
privately I think there should be an
 
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
expectation the dees should just not be
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the position of saying you your well
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
has a problem you need to do something
 
00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
about it I think there needs to be more
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
of an enforcement capability where
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
they're using the analytes and they're
 
00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
going after fingerprints and we know
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
that they can do it based on what Dees
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
has done as it relates to Wells 4 and
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
five and meramac they're able to
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
identify specific poas based on the
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
makeup the makeup is what they call the
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
is what I would call a fingerprint and
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
they can identify what company
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured that particular chemical in
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
in in a given given
 
00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:48.950 align:start position:0%
in in a given given
period

00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
so the second Point regarding
 
00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
Wells is a community in Auburn New
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire new subdivision saddle SLE
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
Hill Estates had a level of iron in
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
their wellwater which is not
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
treatable the standard for subdivisions
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is that you have access
 
00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
have access to water does not get into
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
the planning boards local local land use
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
boards they don't get into portability
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
they don't get into quality that just
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to provide a
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
standard that you're able to provide
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
water to that particular
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so Dees had did a report
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
that that identified the level of iron
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
and it was rising to the level that it
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be treated by any type
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
of point of service system that a
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
homeowner could could put in so I raised
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
because circling back to my initial
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
comment about water being probably the
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
most important commodity that this state
 
00:58:58.270 --> 00:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
will be facing for for Gen
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
Generations it's really
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
important as I feel and even if you
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
don't change the name from Dees to D I
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
do think it's important for Dees to to
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
step up and take the lead to provide and
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
and amplify the things that they've
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
already done but take it a step further
 
00:59:17.789 --> 00:59:17.799 align:start position:0%
as it relates to sampling training and
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
doing next steps uh in going after what
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
may be responsible for contamin
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
private wells in in New in New Hampshire
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
as as all of you are well aware you know
 
00:59:35.069 --> 00:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
P it's it's man-made it's not it's not
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
something that's organic that grows from
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
the ground I mean there's a reason why
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
that these Wells you know are developing
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
a level of taint of contamination that
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
deserves further examination it
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be you you Well's contaminated
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
you need to do something about it I
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
honestly think and I'm hoping that with
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
the with my bill that were taking the
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
necessary next steps for either Dees or
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
D whatever the recommendation is of this
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.270 align:start position:0%
D whatever the recommendation is of this
committee

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
to have a further I don't like to use
 
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
the word oversight because you're
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
treading into private property and I
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
respect that and I understand that there
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
are people that may have objections to
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
that and I certainly respect that but
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a level of enforcement
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
that de should have to be able that once
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
they've analyzed private weals that
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
they're able to do what they need to do
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
to pursue it and to answer the first
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
question that's probably on your mind
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
yes it's going to cost money it
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely has got going to cost money
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
if not changing the name on the letter
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
ahead from DS to D but you know tasking
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
with the people that work at at the
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
agency to do the necessary research and
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
Analysis to be able to identify the
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
source of the pollutants in those
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
private Wells so I said five minutes I
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
think I I think I spoke for eight I
 
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.069 align:start position:0%
think I I think I spoke for eight I
certainly

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
want to thank my esteemed colleagues for
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative for
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm sure you read
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
the letter that we all received from
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
Robert R Scott Commissioner of
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
Dees um in his letter he states that
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
he's opposed to the change of the name
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
and says in one of the sections he
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't think that the requirement to go
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
on to private Wells is needed can you
 
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
have a response to his letter please
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
well if if if I have my neighbor who's
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
getting a letter from Dees that's
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
telling them that they have a level of
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
they have a level of poas that are
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
exceeding the the limits as prescribed
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
by law and we're not following
 
01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
through on on it's one thing to
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
remediate the well whether that's done
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
with public funds or private funds
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but to not begin an
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
investigation to begin tracing
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
how those chemicals got into that
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
particular private well then to me the
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
need is there to elevate going from
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
services to protection because we're
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
asking them to protect the very
 
01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
investment that these folks have by by
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
by when they buy their house and they on
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
a private wealth they're investing you
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
know they're they're investing money
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
into into that because you know I'm old
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
school you know my my dad's my dad's 79
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
he bought his my house his house back in
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
1971 that's his investment people look
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
at housing as as an investment these
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
days and when there's a taint on the
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
investment potentially you could have a
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
taint on their ability to make it
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
marketable for resale assuming you know
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
that they they do the point of point of
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
service Tre whether it be a Gak filter
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
or reverse osmosis um that I mean that
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
certainly is out there but circling back
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
you know outside of hooking up to to
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
public water you know I I truly I truly
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
believe that if if Dees is outreaching
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
to people with private Wells and they're
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
saying that there's an issue then we
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
need to be taking a step further I'm not
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
sure if that answers your question but I
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
don't think it does but I your response
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
I I I apologize representative that's
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I got this uh via email from uh
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
the commissioner so I'm assuming it went
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
to everybody on the committee I received
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
it on Monday Mr chairman I believe it
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
was Monday Mr
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to give you my
 
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.269 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd be happy to give you my
hard

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:04:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
copy

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
forgot to forgot to turn my mic on
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
sorry it'll it's a bad habit uh
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative G for a
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
question okay I'm still a little conf
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
confused about the well issue sure um it
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
says oversight of wells in the title of
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
the bill here correct and uh I don't
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
know the sequence of things that will
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
happen what you're talking about I can't
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
had quite determined that and uh could
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
someone just come onto my property and
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
measure my well water or did so I mean
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
why would they come onto my property to
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
know Outreach was done as it relates to
 
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
my neighbor that they thought that there
 
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
might be an issue regarding private
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
Wells that were outside the decree
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
Circle so they did an examination of
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
those particular houses that were just
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
outside the decree Circle okay and
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
actually that happened to me they came
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
to my house and I'm quote unquote
 
01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
outside of the circle correct and and
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
that's and that's how this this um this
 
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
contamination program came into
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
they they started creeping outside the
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
that decree Circle and started examining
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
so it it it begs it begs the question
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
um it's it's it's getting it just it
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
begs the question as
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
to I feel that there should be a level
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
of oversight what you feel that level of
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
oversight should be I you know to be
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly CED with you if if you know
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
people are not going to want people on
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
people are not going to want Dees on
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
their property just randomly so I would
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
I would presume that protocols or some
 
01:06:16.829 --> 01:06:16.839 align:start position:0%
type of a plan would want to be put in
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
put into place but I would think that
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
there should be some level of
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that de has as it relates
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
to what marac is going through like
 
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
coming outside of that Circle you know
 
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
there needs to begin you know as it
 
01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
relates to marac you know more more of a
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
discussion of getting on to identifying
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
other private Wells making the
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate Outreach and
 
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:44.359 align:start position:0%
ascertaining whether or not a pollutant
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
not for a followup yeah I think I think
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
my followup would be um
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
with the people outside of the area sure
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh would have to be an area that's
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
already um being investigated like the
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
one in marac for examp cor correct so I
 
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you that there needs
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
be appropriate radius original radius
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
for identifying and then working working
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
outwards I would think that would be
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
their I would assume that would I don't
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
like to assume but I would assume that
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
would be their how they would approach
 
01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
it with within their jurisdiction
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
okay for third followup okay I think
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
just then so the people would have to be
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
either sent a letter perhaps so that
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
would be part of this bill so exactly
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's how that's how my
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors were were notified my my
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
notified who
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
else okay represent reprentative post
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
Cohen yes okay
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't you let um homeowners
 
01:08:14.910 --> 01:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
call in to say I think I have a problem
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
with my well or them have an inspection
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
done just to be careful like you would
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
do when
 
01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:25.950 align:start position:0%
do when
you

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
on all this and then
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
create more funding necessary to I
 
01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't stop them that's certainly what
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
their prerogative to do representative
 
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
so so why would we need this if
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners know in their area there has
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
been or even if they're on the fridge
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:03.030 --> 01:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
bill because I feel that there should be
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
more oversight by Dees as it relates
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
to not just and I'm not getting into the
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
management of the well but if somebody
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
is managing their well and you take a
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
contaminant like posos that's that's a
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
man that that's man-made it has to be
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
coming from has to be coming from
 
01:09:24.269 --> 01:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere so that's why
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
Dees or Dees would be equipped to have
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools to be able to do
 
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:31.759 align:start position:0%
that level of
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
Investigation in in in collecting the
 
01:09:38.950 --> 01:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
sample testing the analytes revie the
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
data and being able to make a decision
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
to conduct an
 
01:09:43.719 --> 01:09:45.669 align:start position:0%
to conduct an
investigation

01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
followup um oh that's no that's true
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:59.229 align:start position:0%
 
never

01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
in it seems like too wide of a net there
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay that's fair and and is there any
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
solution to
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
that that you could make an amendment on
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
so I would I would I would want to sew
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
up the net to make it narrow so that
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
it's narrowly focused for a specific
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
contaminant as opposed
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
to every known
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
chemical or organism that that permeates
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
water today so that's a that's a great
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
you can you hear me representative Boyd
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
understand the urgency and critical
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
nature of the past problem in this state
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
and I like what you're trying to do
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
which you're proposing that we do to
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
meet that in this bill particular I also
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
know the bill is going going to go
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
through possibly through through some
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
changes after the public hearing of
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
everyone's testimony and I'm wondering
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
in my mind what happens to this bill if
 
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
we do not change the name of the
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
department but we would add something
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
like a line to the bill that changes the
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
charter of the dees to include
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
protection and then another line in the
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill that expands the responsibility to
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
private Wells especially around PS I
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
just want your opinion if that's going
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
to water down too much what you're
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish so I I read commissioner
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
Scott's letter and and I have a very
 
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
strong working relationship with
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott along with
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner assistant commissioner
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
sandborn and I certainly would be
 
01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
amendable to anything I'm I'm being I'm
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
being honest with you I just that I feel
 
01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
like we're at a point where there's an
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
expectation at least in my community
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.709 align:start position:0%
expectation at least in my community
that

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
that that the general court needs to be
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
providing some direction as to how we
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
handle not just you know not just public
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
water but how we handle private water so
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
I certainly would be receptive to to
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing expanding the
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
mission and and including including the
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
wells not necessarily changing the name
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
so I you know I I'm it's a friendly
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I certainly would be
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
gracious thank you for your response
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I
 
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:32.629 align:start position:0%
thank you I
somewhat

01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
especi but also it is one that is not
 
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
simply tested for in home testing kits I
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
know when I was having trouble with
 
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
know when I was having trouble with
discoloration

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
discoloration
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
in my uh sink and toilet and shower um
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
Dees advised me to get a water test done
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
which cost $80 but it tested for arsenic
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
iron manganese copper and lead a host of
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
other things but not past and then I was
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
able to do some remediation work on my
 
01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
own so
 
01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
um the the bill seems
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
very Lim vague to me almost because it's
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
you say it's to have them do compliance
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
but what I read here is it's just for
 
01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
carrying out inspection and take water
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
samples so is there any way you can like
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
clarify it a little bit better maybe you
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
know the bill entirely because it's I
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
mean it does say or rules adopted under
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
it uh Provisions with this title and I
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the title and it pretty much
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
is Just duties of Dees
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you representative I I
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a a question on again changing the
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
name from services to protection your
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh indicated that you you
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to change the mission so that
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
they were more proactive in
 
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.910 align:start position:0%
they were more proactive in
enforcement

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh having received many changes in
 
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
Mission In My Life a one word change in
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
Mission seems like uh it could be taken
 
01:14:42.189 --> 01:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
in a lot of different ways the cost of
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
that could be quite
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
substantial uh and I'm not sure the
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
mission analysis that was
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
done to achieve whatever wanted it to go
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
mission analysis it says here's the
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
effect that we want and changing this
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
one word is going to achieve that
 
01:15:12.830 --> 01:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
effect simply put and I appreciate the
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you when I think Services
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
I just think I just think it's generic
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
and when I think protection it's like
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
it's good teeth it's and I don't again
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
like I I don't mean to be myopic about
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
it but that's you know that that's how I
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
really look at it I mean that sincerely
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
you know it just when when when you use
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
the word protection it's it's saying you
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
teeth thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative void uh my question I I I
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
kind of want to go back um a little bit
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
um I mirror the concerns of some of my
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the idea of um just
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
entering privately owned I I agree with
 
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
you I'm not gonna I can see the point so
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
my question is because from what you
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
were saying it appears to me that you
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
are more focused on the idea of say like
 
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
a corporate contaminant or something and
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
trying to trace that back couldn't if
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
that was a investigation wouldn't a like
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
a search warrant or or something to that
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
effect to you know uh probable cause uh
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
to collect evidence wouldn't that do
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
suggesting I'm not a
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
lawyer I did stay at a holiday and
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
exence once um sorry just trying to be
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
funny folks I apologize
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it should rise to a
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
level of a search warrant to when I
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
think search warrant I
 
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
think criminal I think you you're going
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
in there to to look for
 
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
um looking for you're looking for
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
information you have you have probable
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
cause um as a you know anecdotally
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
looking at at meramac and as I explain
 
01:17:07.229 --> 01:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
how we have that consent decree and we
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
have this race radius and now the the
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
radius the mission creep is is going
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
outside that radius because there is you
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
know to use the word there is some
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
probable cause to suggest that you know
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
the the P the p is the posos you know
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
the C8 you know FL chemicals you know
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's expanding into into into
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
private Wells
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
so knowing in my experience with how
 
01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
Dees has worked in in marac and and as I
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
said all little to the're they're very
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
thorough and they they know exactly what
 
01:17:44.189 --> 01:17:44.199 align:start position:0%
they're doing um I don't think it should
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
get to a level of the certain laws that
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.629 --> 01:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
provide them the enough level of of
 
01:17:59.639 --> 01:18:00.930 align:start position:0%
provide them the enough level of of
discretion

01:18:00.930 --> 01:18:00.940 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:02.310 align:start position:0%
discretion

to casually Outreach to people and say
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
hey you're just outside the circle we'd
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
like to come in and look at your wells I
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
think right now is is has been has been
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.550 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
questions

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative for a question
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you Mr chair um so I'm going to
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
piggyback a little bit on the whole
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
government entity taking the water
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
sample on private property um I take a
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
lot of water samples with my business
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I do happen to know that Pasa
 
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
testing is available at a lot of the
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
local Labs um Nelson Analytical in
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester is one of them you do have to
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
request the test but they can't handle
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
it um would you be open to possibly
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
having those tests made available and
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
homeowners being able to test their own
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
notified short answer is yes but I
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
didn't know I actually and I'm
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to say this I did not know
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
existed so that may be something in my
 
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
role with the drinking water and
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
groundwater advisory
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
commission would consider because we do
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
we've done pilot programs over the last
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
couple of years for for a variety of
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
different things perking new wells for
 
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
people up in the North Country uh we've
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
done some Source water development um
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
we've done done a lot of small pilot
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
projects in that particular that
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
actually is is a great idea um and I
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
certainly would be receptive to that
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
whether it is incorporated directly
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
through Dees or uh through the role of
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
fund um
 
01:19:58.030 --> 01:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't um it it is a special
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
any any more questions from the
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll pass uh with that uh thank you
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
very thank you very much Mr chairman to
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
you and the committee thank you very
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
much for your time okay the next uh
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
person looking to testify is Brandon and
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's K RN and the rest of the number
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
together and so how do you how do you
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
spell the how do you spell the last part
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
of your name I'm sorry a e r n as a
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
Nancy e n is a Nancy
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm well good morning Mr
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
I'm Brandon kernin I'm the administrator
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
of the drinking water and groundwater
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
Bureau here to testify on House Bill uh
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
1452 um there's two aspects to the bill
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
that are not directly related so I
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
didn't indicate if we opposed or had or
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
or supported the bill just because we
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
have quite slightly different takes on
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
the two aspects of the bill as far as
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
reaming could you speak uh into the
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
microphone bring it bring it a little
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
you all right is that better right thank
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
you so there's two aspects to the bill
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
one renaming department environmental
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
services the Department of Environmental
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
Protection um the department is opposed
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
to that change and we believe Services
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
is a good way to describe how we achieve
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection we not only
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
rely on our statutory Authority and the
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
rules we make but we largely uh rely on
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
providing technical assistance financial
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
assistance education Outreach
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration with stakeholders and
 
01:22:07.229 --> 01:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
communities and then ultimately um
 
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
regulation and to the degree that we are
 
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
proactive in our administration of our
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
programs it's really dictated by the
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
statutes and what's required of us so to
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
the extent someone feels that we're
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
being passive on something we probably
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
should look at more the statute opposed
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
to the name in my opinion but I feel
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
like the current approach under Services
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
is very effective it's always most
 
01:22:31.149 --> 01:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
effective to work with people first and
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
you get 98% of the problems addressed
 
01:22:35.709 --> 01:22:35.719 align:start position:0%
before you get to the more difficult
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory enforcement aspects so that's
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
why we oppose that it also would be very
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
costly at a time that the agency is very
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
busy um we're addressing past
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
contamination Statewide arsic magines
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
and a number of other issues so divert
 
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
resources time and probably cause
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
confusion all the while the other aspect
 
01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill about giving the department
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
explicit authority to enter private
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
property to collect water
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
samples and also administer the
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of the Safe Drinking Water
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
Act we have no position on we do work
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
with the water well board um who
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
oversees private well construction
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
maintenance and pump installation and we
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
do address groundwater contamination and
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have found we've had great success
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
working with property owners to
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
voluntarily gain access to their
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
properties to sample Wells when we have
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and we do have a process when
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's contamination and sending out
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
letters there actually a law that
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
requires we notify people within 500
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
feet of a known exceedence of a state
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
regul state drinking water standard and
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
then for the case of past we're actually
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
offering to sample the well at no cost
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
to the homeowner it's it's off up to the
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
property owner though to respond to that
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
request and and have us come on the
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
property where we have instances that
 
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:54.280 align:start position:0%
where we're really concerned about
 
01:23:56.790 --> 01:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
public health and safety and an acute
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
sense that something really bad could
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
happen immediately if actions not taken
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
we have worked with local Health
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
officers who have extensive authorities
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
to enter properties to address public
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
health and we have a recent example of
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
that of a site in Lancaster where a
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
landlord put a well in a wetland in a
 
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
contaminated Wetland and was serving the
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
tenants at water supply and we worked
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the local Health officer and the
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
local police to gain access to the
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
property to to stop that situation
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
and so for those reasons we we don't
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
take a position but I can't show a lot
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
of examples in my 20 years at the
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
department where we have not been able
 
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
to access a property I will just point
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
out if we have reasonable um information
 
01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
to suggest someone's polluting the
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
environment on a property there was a
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
whole another process to compel somebody
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
to do investigations um using licensed
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
professionals if they're not going to
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
let us on site and so that's how we
 
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
address those situations and I'd be
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.310 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
questions

01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative Smith thank you
 
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr kerin for
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the letter that
 
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott wrote he said that
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
even with the language in this bill that
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
enables the department to enter
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
privately owned lands a land owner May
 
01:25:19.149 --> 01:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
refuse entry um and they must obtain an
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
administrative warrant so is that so is
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
that different I mean right now anyone
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
can refuse entry onto their property so
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
even with this bill they could do that
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not really going to fix
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
everything that's correct um I could
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide you the legal analysis for that
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
our enforcement document for the agency
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
talks about inspections of properties
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
and even where we have clear statutory
 
01:25:49.229 --> 01:25:49.239 align:start position:0%
Authority Under other unrelated statutes
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately anybody can refuse our
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
immediate entry and require we get an
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
administrative search warrant and that's
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
actually the case for many non-law
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement statutes out there where
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
that you know private property owners
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
are afforded that one opportunity where
 
01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
we have to go through that procedure my
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
20 years I've never had to go there yet
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
I know it's been done before but yes for
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
Dees any inspection could be put off
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
until we have that administrative search
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
warrant if the property owner wants to
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
take advantage of
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
Cohen thank for taking my question I
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
just need some clarification on entering
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
private property for well you gave a
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
great example I think of Lancaster what
 
01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
happens if a tenant on a property or
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
apartment complex has the water tested
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's through the state or wants
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
the water tested through private person
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
or state and it's polluted somehow but
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
the property owner refuses to allow the
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
state or private um testing company on
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
the property to conduct the test what
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
would the tenant's rights be in that
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
case so there's a a specific statute and
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
I can get the number for you I don't
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
have it memorized that actually states
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
that land owners that have tenants must
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate water supply and
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's about the that's the essence of
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
the wording I might be off a little bit
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
and so that protection's there and it
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
would be up to the health officer to
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
enforce it I will say I'm aware of many
 
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
less than satisfying instances
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
where the very situation you present
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
someone who's renting something is not
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
happy about the water quality either
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
aesthetically or from a health
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint and they sort of get stuck in
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
limbo because we don't have authority to
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
jump in on that but we don't compel the
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
property owner to fix the problem and so
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's really up to the health
 
01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
officer and they interpret an adequate
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
supply of water many different ways
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's not defined mind and so it is an
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
issue that's come up from time to time
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
that hasn't always been perfectly
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
resolved there was a bill a couple years
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
ago I think it may have stalled due to
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
covid you know many of the bills sort of
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
lost progress when Co set in that was
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to have more testing requirements
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
for landlords I think it was potentially
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
going to a study committee because it
 
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
was complicated and also when you get in
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
these situations sometimes when you
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
start we try to help in those situations
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
we say it's not our problem but often we
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
start learning there's other issues
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
between the renters and the and the
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
owner and about who's paying or not
 
01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
paying what and so it gets complicated
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
you really have to think out how you
 
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
would do that if you're going
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
to add more to that process okay thank
 
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.109 --> 01:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Mr chair thank you sir
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um given this
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
bill has a fiscal note but there's a
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
zero number in there and and you alluded
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
to the phrase costly um as well as it's
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
reference in the letter do you have an
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
estimate of the cost and if since the
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
agency was contacted why there's no
 
01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:04.870 align:start position:0%
agency was contacted why there's no
fiscal

01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
note so the the primary cost isn't so
 
01:29:09.910 --> 01:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
much with the inspecting the wells
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
because we are already sampling Wells
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry let me clarify the name I
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
think starting with the name change so
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's really indeterminable we have
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
probably over 20,000 documents on our
 
01:29:22.510 --> 01:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
website our rules
 
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
um our
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
stationary it we staff would have to go
 
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
in and reproduce every document you see
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
on our website to change that that name
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
possibly a logo and so that that's just
 
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
really difficult to estimate the cost
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
followup I'm aware that the department
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
of resources and economic development
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
changed their name to the Bea um so
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
that's been done there's probably a cost
 
01:29:49.709 --> 01:29:49.719 align:start position:0%
analysis that has been done by state
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
Administration is that something that
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
the AG he can look into so that we can
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
understand what the true fiscal note
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
would be we can certainly ask admin
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
Services if they have an estimate of
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
what that cost was thank you
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
sir representative post for a
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:13.719 align:start position:0%
you today for testifying um I do have
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
two questions so if I could do a
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
followup um after this um currently you
 
01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
said if a homeowner calls do you can go
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
out and do a posos test is that
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
correct not not exactly what we're doing
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
right now is we have targeted areas
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
where we found contamination and by
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
state law we have to notify all Property
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
Owners within 500 feet where we have an
 
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
exceedence and for past because the
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has provided some funding
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
for it within that 500 feet notification
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
letter we are offering to sample the
 
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
well at no cost to the homeowner where
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
staff will come out and collect the
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
sample that has not always been the case
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
but for past we've been funded to do
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
that but just anyone can't call it has
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
to be in a in a focused area we do have
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
um a web survey for where people could
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
put in requests to be sampled and as we
 
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
um discover new areas of contamination
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
we often go there first to see where we
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
can get other sampling sites quickly
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
before our notifications go out but
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
right now just anybody can't um request
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
it or anyone can request it but not
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
everyone will get sampled unless you're
 
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
in a target targeted area
 
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:23.430 align:start position:0%
in a target targeted area
follow

01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
up so in that when you find that there
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
is contamination outside of the area and
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
someone has responded to a letter you've
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
sent do you then start
 
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
tracing yes that process of going out
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
500 feet notifying sampling then as more
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
exceedances another 500 foot circle and
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's why we have such a backlog now
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
the representative boy is right there's
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
a serious problem New Hampshire with
 
01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:56.119 align:start position:0%
past contamination and the more harder
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
we work the more work we have it just
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
keeps going out and out because of the
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
extent of contamination the population
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
center of the state so it just continues
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
on to St we have a backlog of hundreds
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
sampled another followup please
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
um the funding that you're receiving is
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
there is this covid funds is it um arpa
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
funds is it
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
how at what point are those funds going
 
01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
to be expended with the knowledge that
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
growing so I would have to get back to
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
you on that assessment um you know
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
there's the funds $6 million believe
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
from The Advisory commission is to
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
investigate past where there's no
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
responsible party and do another number
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
of other things such as figure out
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
destruction Technologies for getting rid
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
of P out of the environment
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
you know ultimately what the state needs
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
and there's litigation with the
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice on this at this
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
point is every well needs to be sampled
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the state and pest is pervasive it's
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
just not in southern Hampshire it's in
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
downtown Center Harbor it's in stratom
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's in Windam and the the only way to
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
know if it's succeeding due to the
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
extent of so many sources is to actually
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
sample the wells and so hopefully
 
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
someday we will get the resources from
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
responsible parties to address the
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
situation fully
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
followup um and as you've been involved
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the posos is there have you found
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
cancer clusters um in the areas that you
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
have been um sampling and is that one of
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
the problems that um has arisen so in
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
our state that's a complicated question
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
um is it's a lot of science behind that
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
and the epidemiology is little be on my
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
expertise but I am aware of one Cor
 
01:33:53.590 --> 01:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
correlation but causation might not
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
exactly be established and that is in
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
aramac there's been found to be a higher
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
incidence of kidney cancer and based on
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
some recent data from EPA on pfoa that
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
is one of the large health concerns of
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
PF is kidney cancer two haven't been
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
connected so I don't want to misstate
 
01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
that and maramax had other contaminants
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
back in the 80s in their water supply
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
Wells too that that they've since
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
addressed so it's a complicated issue
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
but there is that one correlation I'm
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very
 
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh Al I actually have a
 
01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.149 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh Al I actually have a
question

01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:30.159 --> 01:34:32.189 align:start position:0%
question
uh

01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
knowing the uh level of supervision or
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh Authority you have over the
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
other uh sources of
 
01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
water uh if you have authority over
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
Lakes you have authority over uh ground
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
you have authority over groundwater you
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
have authority over
 
01:34:56.119 --> 01:34:58.910 align:start position:0%
have authority over
commercial

01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh activities with water uh would
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
would this bill uh allow you to have
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
that level of control over the
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
residential Wells that are in homes
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
now uh that you have over commercial
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
Wells and all of the other sources of
 
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.510 align:start position:0%
Wells and all of the other sources of
water

01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
it would give us the same level of
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
access potentially but as far as
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
authority to propel a homeowner to take
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
action if they had natural or man-made
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
contaminants no right now there's no
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
State regulation of private wellwater
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
quality or even a testing requirement
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
for private wellwater quality right for
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
for now but could this then apply all of
 
01:35:48.870 --> 01:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
a sudden to all if you get if this bill
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
were passed could all of the uh uh
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
levels of various contaminants that are
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
that are in that may be appear in uh
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
commercial water or in other or lake
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
water things of that nature will be now
 
01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
appli to
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
homeowners so if a homeowner has a
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
contaminated water supply and we're
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
aware of responsible party we can compel
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
the responsible party to mitigate that
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
homeowner's water supply right now
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
homeowner wants that they but they have
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
a right to say I want nothing to do with
 
01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
responsible party or Dees this bill
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change that it would just give
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
us access to actually collect a water
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
sample uh the way I read the bill it
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
says you have you know
 
01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:44.270 align:start position:0%
says you have you know
you

01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh the purpose of carrying out
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
inspection and for the purpose of taking
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
water samples and to determine comp
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
compliance with provisions of this title
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
or rules adopted under it so you can
 
01:36:59.590 --> 01:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
adopt rules once you have jurisdiction
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
you can adopt rules in pretty much uh
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
any way you would you would wish to
 
01:37:08.430 --> 01:37:08.440 align:start position:0%
expand the authority of the uh Dees over
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
local over
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
residential uh Wells so the Safe
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Act which is what this
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
references RSA
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
485 98% of it pertains to Public Water
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
Systems which
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
is larger water system a larger entity
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
serving a lot of people water more than
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
15 connections or 25
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
people um under the state Drinking Water
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
Act there's only one provision for
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
private Wells and that has to do with
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
the es and a health officer being able
 
01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
to order a well not to be used if we
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
believe it poses a health risk and then
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
there's a a fencing requirement for
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
certain types of Wells the statute that
 
01:37:52.589 --> 01:37:52.599 align:start position:0%
pertains to private Wells say 483 I
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
believe B the water well board and
 
01:37:57.629 --> 01:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
that's where well construction standards
 
01:37:59.709 --> 01:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
are established for all wells in the
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
state including private Wells so we have
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
no rule making authority to make water
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
quality standards for private Wells we
 
01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
have guidance and we provide that
 
01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
guidance to towns and some towns have
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
adopted local regulations that require
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
new wells when they're drilled be tested
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
there was legislation again I think
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
pending During the period right
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
preceding Co that was and pursued by the
 
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislature but it stalled out when Co
 
01:38:26.669 --> 01:38:26.679 align:start position:0%
took us off
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
track and and a final final
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
question you you stated that if someone
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
is at the present time if someone
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
has uh received a a letter from you
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
that that uh there's been water F water
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
well contamination within
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
500 is it 500 feet that you will test
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
their well for past only at this time
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
fore gee I got a letter like that a
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
month or so ago and nobody said that
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
nobody said you would do that it didn't
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
offer to sample your well of course
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
not why would I be asking yeah I see
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
that please and I could get back to you
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
on why that okay uh well I think I know
 
01:39:20.589 --> 01:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
why it's in the town of Hudson not in
 
01:39:23.070 --> 01:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
any of the other towns that
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh rep the representative voyd
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is one exception I I
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
should correct that we offered a sample
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
when there's no viable responsible party
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
so like inside this centree area St Goan
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
we are telling them to go sample the
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
private Wells um but when you're outside
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
the area or like in downtown Center
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
Harbor where there's no obvious
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
contamination Source that's where DS
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're not spending State resources when
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
there's a viable responsible party that
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
has to use their own funds for that okay
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I okay we'll talk later thank
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
you anyone else for a
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
question representative Healey
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative Healey for a question
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker okay I sit on the
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
737 commission and um there was a couple
 
01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
of over sites and I just want to know if
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
this would even help um what we found is
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
on a couple of the occasions you were
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
only going 7 F feet out from the wells
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
and now you're going out to 500 feet I'm
 
01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
not going to get into the why that
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
happened it just it did happen so we
 
01:40:33.149 --> 01:40:33.159 align:start position:0%
added like 130 or 40 more users that you
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
had to go out and
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
test the big thing that I have an issue
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
with now there are people out there now
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
that have been for three years have been
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
on bottled water delivered to the
 
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
house I'm talking about pallets of
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
water bottles of
 
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
water and I think at this point that
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
there should be some remediation for
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
them whether it be I know you keep
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
talking about we may tie them when we
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
may tie them in some people of these
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
people are way away from any water
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
supply that you ever going to tie them
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
into why aren't we looking at um trying
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
to get point of entry systems in these
 
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
houses at this time it this is something
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at and I I I
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
know you can't say you can't do this but
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be done
 
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.510 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be done
right

01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:41:23.229 --> 01:41:23.239 align:start position:0%
now yes it
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
Wy so we understand there's a large
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
number of Wells that are impacted with P
 
01:41:31.149 --> 01:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
fasts that don't have a viable
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
responsible party and that a long-term
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
solution to extending water supply could
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
be hundred million dollar in certain
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
areas of the state very costly with
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
again no viable responsible party and
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
bottle water achieved one thing that's
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
really important it stopped the exposure
 
01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
of past and drinking water but it's
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
really unsatisfactory it doesn't make
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
people whole and for that reason reason
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
just last Monday the drinking water
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
advisory commission which represent Boyd
 
01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
is on and very much supported this
 
01:42:01.109 --> 01:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
concept approved $5 million to provide a
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
rebate program for people that have
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
contaminated Wells it' be $1,500 so
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's approved it probably take a month
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%
or two for staff to stand up the program
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
because it's a whole new program that we
 
01:42:14.350 --> 01:42:14.360 align:start position:0%
we have but it's really the first time
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
the state has put a lot of funding out
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
there to help private well owners who
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't receive the tax the grants that
 
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems get from the
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
federal government to address an issue
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
like this it's not perfect but it's at
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
least a big incremental improvement from
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
where we have
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
been and there there is a lot of work
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
going on with London da and all Southern
 
01:42:38.750 --> 01:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there multiple studies uh
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
conceptualizing how to extend water how
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
to get the right who has enough water to
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
extend there what would be the cost be
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
what would be the legal mechanisms of
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
Water Systems it's incredibly
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
complicated um but I I understand your
 
01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.750 align:start position:0%
complicated um but I I understand your
frustration

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
frustration
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions from the
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
a uh Mark sandor assistant commissioner
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
you wish
 
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
to speak on the bill
 
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record Mark Sor
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner New Hampshire
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
Dees um I just wanted to offer a couple
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
clarifying points to some of the
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions Brandon got just to make sure
 
01:43:39.629 --> 01:43:39.639 align:start position:0%
they were on the record uh correctly um
 
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
first and foremost and this is really
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
important to commissioner Scott um often
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
a bill like this um and I'm referring to
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill access um
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
increasing access um um sometimes it can
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
come across as if an agency has asked a
 
01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislator um we have an issue could you
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
help us with this we want to make sure
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the record um uh Dees did not ask for
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
this U motion to be brought forward um
 
01:44:10.669 --> 01:44:10.679 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and I have a ton of
 
01:44:12.589 --> 01:44:12.599 align:start position:0%
respect for the sponsor of this bill
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
I've known him 20 years and I know he's
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
looking out for his community and his
 
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
constituents um but we really think that
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
this is a solution looking for a problem
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh the challenges particularly with
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
pfest don't relate to access for testing
 
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues and there's a
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons and you've talked about
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
them but we have not had a challenge
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
sampling through the current process so
 
01:44:42.669 --> 01:44:42.679 align:start position:0%
this would not help address the P issues
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
that we have in Southern New Hampshire
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
mentioned

01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.910 --> 01:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
and um but I will reiterate we feel the
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
current name regardless of the cost is
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
much more in the spirit of the New
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire approach to state regulatory
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
um in terms of serving our constituents
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
versus oversight and the last thing just
 
01:45:16.030 --> 01:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
because it's such a sensitive issue um
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
to the question about cancer clusters uh
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
we really DS should really be referring
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
you to um Health and Human Services they
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
have done a test there's a report that
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
came out recently um that is not our
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
area of expertise and um while Brendan
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's correct and you know
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
we've learned it from our colleagues
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
there I I really would refer you to
 
01:45:41.709 --> 01:45:41.719 align:start position:0%
those questions um to HHS is that's
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
their area of expertise and and and um
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know their responsibility to to look
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
at on behalf of the uh citizens of the
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:55.149 align:start position:0%
at on behalf of the uh citizens of the
state

01:45:55.149 --> 01:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
representative post for a question yes
 
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for um allowing me to
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
ask this question um could the change of
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
name be chain be be done in a different
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
way and put in like a mission statement
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
or something um rather than changing
 
01:46:16.270 --> 01:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
your name and having to go through all
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
of that so protecting the natural
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
resources and environment of uh of New
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is already in our mission
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
statement um and again I I very much
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the motivation of the
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
sponsors um and the feeling out there in
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
some communities that um um are they
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
being protected by the state I you know
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
with some of the issues that have been
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
brought to light I I I totally
 
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that sentiment I just don't
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
think this is the way to uh solve it the
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
way we'll solve it is to continue
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
sampling find out where the past
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
clusters exist coming up with solutions
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
for either well or public um sources of
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
drinking water um and continuing to make
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
the progress we've made in working with
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
the folks that we can identify as
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay for their cost and
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
where we can't find out with Public
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
Funding Solutions um to the folks are
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
there outside those areas that
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
That's How we'll make progress on these
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
issues um but it is already in our
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
mission to protect the natural resources
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
the environment um and the the waters um
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
drinking water um and and recreational
 
01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
Waters of the state and we take that
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
charge um very wholeheartedly and do our
 
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
best to to live up to that
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
mission I have a question oh I'll get
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'll give I'll return to you is it the
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
is would you feel that it is within the
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
purview of the legislative branch to
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
determine the name of what the executive
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
branch calls
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
itself uh sure I mean you you think it
 
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
is within our purview okay I mean I I I
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
mean I think you know I mean that that
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
we have a you know classic system of of
 
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
checks and balances and if uh the folks
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
that determine our funding feel they
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
they want to call our agency something
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
else well you know we'd respect that I
 
01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:28.679 align:start position:0%
just I I you know just speaking as a
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
lifelong granted stator I think I think
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
the name reflects the culture and
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
approach of New Hampshire and and and
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
state agent and and state
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory um more so than protection
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
and um I I I I I I we have a very often
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
not always but we have have good working
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
relationships with communities and
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
residents and and I think part of it
 
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
comes from we view them as our customers
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
and our constituents not as folks we're
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
there to bring oversight towards and I
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
I'd just be nervous that a change of
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
name would would would give it a
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
different feel but we certainly respect
 
01:49:12.669 --> 01:49:12.679 align:start position:0%
the con state constitution and the
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
authorities uh of of the fine
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:20.629 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative post for a follow on
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much um just um
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
they talked the last speaker talked
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
about responsible party um they would go
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
to them for the funds is there any have
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
you kept a an account where there isn't
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
responsible parties that um now the
 
01:49:46.270 --> 01:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
state is paying for and is that part of
 
01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
the litigation that's going forward yeah
 
01:49:50.510 --> 01:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we got have to be a little careful
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
given there is pending legislation but
 
01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:53.870 align:start position:0%
given there is pending legislation but
broadly

01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
speaking um with some parties we've been
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
able to come to agreement on
 
01:50:03.070 --> 01:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility um and as a result you
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
know there there and I understand why
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
especially in the world we live in and
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know as we start
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
2022 we haven't talked a ton about what
 
01:50:15.070 --> 01:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
has been done the over 400 Wells that
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
have been addressed the new public water
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
sources that have been um put in place a
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
lot has been done um to this point and a
 
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
lot more needs to be done um there are
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
still people using bottled water so it
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's you know I totally understand both
 
01:50:38.350 --> 01:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
sides of that coin um but um
 
01:50:42.069 --> 01:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
I um sorry I lost my train thought uh uh
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
there so number so where there has been
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
agreement among parties on where there
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
is responsibility we've been able to
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
move forward where there hasn't been
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
agreement on responsible parties one of
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
two things is happening either we are
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
looking uh we are reviewing if we can
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
identify who we could show data that we
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
believe um a responsible party has been
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
identified um and there is pend pending
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
leg legislation in other areas where we
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
believe our responsible party has been
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
identified and they haven't agreed to
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
that on their end so you know it's kind
 
01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
of three-prong we're in the process of
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
having the court system agree with us
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
we've been able to come to a mutual
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
agreement with some parties and we're
 
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
areas the last one um yeah so um do you
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
have an amount of um
 
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures that haven't been covered
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
by the responsible parties
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
um um a little bit of that is I
 
01:51:51.550 --> 01:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
identified in some of the pending
 
01:51:56.830 --> 01:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuits so I um need to be careful but
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
um I I I in conjunction with the
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office we are
 
01:52:06.589 --> 01:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
ensuring that any amount we bring
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
forward we can justify in terms of we
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
feel it is um the appropriate cost for
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh mitigation for uh an
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.790 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:52:27.790 --> 01:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay for a second for a second time
 
01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.430 align:start position:0%
okay for a second for a second time
representative

01:52:32.430 --> 01:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
Healey um I I will remind the with the
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh committee that we are a half an hour
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
over talking about uh what Bill said
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
about a little bit more teeth uh
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
recently you sent a letter to uh s
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
gobain about
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
bypassing the RL do you think just
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
sending a letter was going to be good
 
01:52:57.310 --> 01:52:57.320 align:start position:0%
enough where he was saying whether would
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
be more teeth in it would you think more
 
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
teeth would have been better about
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah so the letter is the form part
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the formal process to get on the
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
record what we have um uh identified and
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
information that has uh come our way I
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
promise you we are uh working with st
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
Goan right now um about what happened in
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
the permitting process um uh why um the
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
stack that is in question um was built
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
um what we believe outside of the
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
permitting process I do want to get on
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
the record In fairness um what they
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
built is can get a receive a permit they
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
didn't do something that um is against
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
Statute in and of itself it just um they
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
hadn't been permitted for it so we will
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
work with them as we do with any um
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
entity um commercial or private where
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
there um uh what we believe was a
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
mistake uh or
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
improper uh development in the
 
01:54:12.189 --> 01:54:12.199 align:start position:0%
permitting process and um uh part of
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
that will be um action on their part and
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
which also could
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
include uh mitigation for what has
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
happened um I will say this um and from
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
a public safety perspective all of the
 
01:54:27.790 --> 01:54:27.800 align:start position:0%
tests and our folks are on there when
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
they are testing them and ensured that
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
the U bypass stack was not in use uh the
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
stacks they use in their everyday um did
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
meet all of our air requirements so from
 
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
a public health standpoint um we don't
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
believe there's any uh public health
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
risk um with what happened um they they
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't didn't follow the permitting
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
process correctly um we will work with
 
01:54:55.629 --> 01:54:55.639 align:start position:0%
them on that we will get it correctly
 
01:54:57.709 --> 01:54:57.719 align:start position:0%
permitted um and we will work with the
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and their
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers um to work on mitigation just as
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
we would in any other time when a permit
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't properly
 
01:55:10.870 --> 01:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
followed thank you very
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
much I know you're behind so I don't
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
want to yeah seeing no other uh
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate your time okay
 
01:55:26.109 --> 01:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.229 --> 01:55:45.239 align:start position:0%

01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
minutes Mr chair members of the
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee I will keep my uh comments
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
brief to respect the time uh New
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors is
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill I apologize for the
 
01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:07.639 align:start position:0%
record my name is Chris Norwood I am the
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
2022 public policy chair for the New
 
01:56:12.629 --> 01:56:12.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association uh we are opposed
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
to this bill as written uh not so much
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the name change portion but relative
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
to uh the uh the entering of private
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
property which is where our concern
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
mainly lies uh let me just skip ahead to
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
what has not already been covered I
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
think that one of the things that
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
concerns us is not only entering into
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
the premise but most of the uh the Water
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
Testing that I have seen is is done at
 
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
the faucet and the tap so not only are
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
you entering upon uh private property
 
01:56:43.109 --> 01:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
owners land but also into their their
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
domicile which is of
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
concern uh it also doesn't uh clarify
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
under which Circ circumstances uh one
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
neighbor would have their well well
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
water tested and the abutter may not uh
 
01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a concern so who
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
gets the to choose which private
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
properties get entered into uh is is
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
another uh
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
concern uh I'll skim ahead here has been
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
covered been
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
covered I I think that the the comment
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
came up relative to uh Community well
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
sources um and I think that that's
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
another important piece um so the dees
 
01:57:20.990 --> 01:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
does have standards for Community well
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
water and commercial property um and
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
while those are not imposed on a private
 
01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:28.360 align:start position:0%
property owner those in fact have become
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
the deao standard for a private uh
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
property test so at the point of sale
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
when uh somebody is getting a water
 
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
inspection if they elect to do so
 
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's a check box on the realtor
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.669 align:start position:0%
 
priv

01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
has their their go-to again it's not a
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
mandate but that is de facto standard
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
that they turn to so uh that was a
 
01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:01.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying question from um one of the
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
representatives earlier
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
um and yeah and then at that point it's
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
really up to the home buyer Andor seller
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
to contribute uh whether or not what
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
remediation system is appropriate for
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
them uh verse osmosis I've seen I've
 
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
seen uh uh uh water softeners um in
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
various other tools um typically within
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
the private domicile again this is for
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
private properties not so for you know
 
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
Community Wells those are under a
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
different uh statute so I thank you Mr
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
chair and representatives and uh that's
 
01:58:34.159 --> 01:58:36.790 align:start position:0%
chair and representatives and uh that's
my

01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.709 --> 01:58:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
much representative Smith for a question
 
01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:45.639 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr Norwood for taking my question um
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
you state that a point of sale is when
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the homeowner will choose to have
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
their water tested and um my question
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
is do realtors because they are the key
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
person that the homeowner home buyer is
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
usually working with do they um do you
 
01:59:13.629 --> 01:59:13.639 align:start position:0%
give information packets to potential
 
01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
home owners uh talking about why it's
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
good to have your water tested you know
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
Dees has a lot of these things having
 
01:59:22.109 --> 01:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
your septic system checked before you
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
buy the property having your water well
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
water checked before you buy the
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
property do realtors do this
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
customarily not so much a like there's a
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
lead paint pamplet which I think that
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's coming to my mind with your
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
question representative um but not so
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
much that but there is a statutory
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirement so for any of you
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
who have bought and sold a home you
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
might be aware of there's a five page
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
six-page disclosure and I believe it's
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
oh geez I'm going to go on the record
 
01:59:54.589 --> 01:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
with 477 or maybe it's 483 that
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
references uh statuto uh disclosure
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and wellwater uh any known
 
02:00:03.069 --> 02:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
contaminants uh the last time it was
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
tested um who the vendor was that was
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
that performed the testing those are
 
02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
requirements that a home seller is
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
obligated to disclose to the home buyer
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
so there is an obligatory right for uh
 
02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
the realtor in this case the leny and as
 
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the property seller to
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
disclose um those items to a potential
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
buyer thank you very
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%

02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
paragraphs a through up to 20 parts per
 
02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
trillion um is and I'll and I will be
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
brief because I think I know most of if
 
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
not all of you are well aware of the
 
02:02:16.750 --> 02:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
impacts the environmental impact
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
that perforated chemicals have on on a
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
variety of different things both you
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
know fetal development you know cancer
 
02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:31.149 align:start position:0%
know fetal development you know cancer
uh

02:02:31.149 --> 02:02:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
crops that and that kind of thing
 
02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.550 align:start position:0%
crops that and that kind of thing
the

02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:39.629 --> 02:02:39.639 align:start position:0%
two chemicals that I'm seeking to add to
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
the list is p pfba and PFS and for all
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
intents and purposes um it's just it's
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
just another
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
it's just another type of pfoa that has
 
02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
been created used being used on specific
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
consumer products food packaging and
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
other types of industrial
 
02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:05.470 align:start position:0%
other types of industrial
processes

02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.470 --> 02:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
so the guide the guidance that I'm
 
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
proposing as I said is seven parts per
 
02:03:14.109 --> 02:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
trillion for P for pfba and a th000
 
02:03:17.790 --> 02:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
parts per Tron for pfbs and this would
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
be added to
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
the existing uh peroral alkal substances
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
that exist in in our
 
02:03:27.830 --> 02:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
rsas as providing
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
a limit as to how those chemicals can be
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
used and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
 
02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:47.870 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
the

02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
committee

02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.390 --> 02:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question uh
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
the uh seven in a thousand figures that
 
02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
you presented do those come from a
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
certain source so the the seven Parts
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
patrolling is based off of analysis that
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
was done by the Department of Health for
 
02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
the state of Minnesota based on specific
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
research and criteria that they had used
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
they had arrived at at a at an mdh
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%
guidance value of seven parts
 
02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
portray thank you representative and
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for allowing me to
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
ask the question um are you aware that
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
in 2018 legislation that we passed I
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
believe enabled Dees to develop uh
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
standards for new p poas p pfcs if
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
evidence was found uh to require that
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.109 --> 02:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you representative
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
for your your uh input I'm I'm reading
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
the the letter that we got from De s uh
 
02:05:22.470 --> 02:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Scott who's uh
 
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
recommending that we not support this
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh and then I'm looking at the
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
financial um statement in the back which
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
as I read it uh it's a 12 12 million
 
02:05:36.639 --> 02:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
as I read it uh it's a 12 12 million
cost

02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
um 12 or 12.4 million uh up to uh and so
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
I I'm just trying to understand what
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
does $122 million buy me and why would I
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
do it if my Dees is saying we don't need
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
it because it it creates a a class of
 
02:06:01.229 --> 02:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
chemicals that confuses the issue it
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's another it's it's it's another type
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
of chemical that potentially is going
 
02:06:07.229 --> 02:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
into in the water or the air that
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
potentially could have an impact on
 
02:06:13.669 --> 02:06:13.679 align:start position:0%
public health so the cost that you
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
potentially would be paying for would be
 
02:06:19.390 --> 02:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
to to Reg to to regulate
 
02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:20.549 align:start position:0%
to to Reg to to regulate
in

02:06:20.549 --> 02:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
part okay no and and but DS says they're
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
already doing it yes I read I read the
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
letter that is correct okay so you're
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
saying they're wrong I'm not saying
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're wrong at
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.589 --> 02:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative gotl thank you
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I see that you uh said you
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
got the statistics from the state of
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
Minnesota that's correct uh have are
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
there any other sets of Statistics that
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
are comparable or similar and why did
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
you choose Minnesota quite honestly was
 
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
the only one that popped out in my
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
research it it seems that that the state
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
of Minnesota is really the only one that
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
I could find and want to research the
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
matter further but state of Minnesota
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
was the only one that I found that had
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
done a significant level of research to
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
to justify The Advisory that they put
 
02:07:29.189 --> 02:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
out thank
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you anyone else or a
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you thank you
 
02:07:40.830 --> 02:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman again thank you to
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
my colleagues through you to my
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues thank
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr uh Mr
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:08:00.910 align:start position:0%
you Mr uh Mr
Kieran

02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:03.589 --> 02:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
you have the floor thank you chairman
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
and members of committee again I'm
 
02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
Brandon kernin administrator of the
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater Bureau
 
02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Environmental
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
Services testifying on House Bill
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
1618 the department is opposed to this
 
02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill um I want to point out that you
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
back when the statute was changed to
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
enable or require Dees to adopt
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
standards for for pfoa pfna pfhxs and uh
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
pfos it not only required that we do it
 
02:08:33.629 --> 02:08:33.639 align:start position:0%
but it also enabled Us by establishing
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
two positions a toxicologist and health
 
02:08:39.149 --> 02:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
risk assessor who are now tasked with
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
not only adopting the standards that we
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
have done but to continue to review the
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
science and propose new drinking water
 
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
standards as warranted opposed to
 
02:08:49.470 --> 02:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
looking to the legisl to proposed value
 
02:08:52.270 --> 02:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
so we figure the process that's been
 
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
established and the capacity that's been
 
02:08:56.589 --> 02:08:56.599 align:start position:0%
given to Dees is really how we should
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
assess and adopt standards going forward
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
you know based on science I want to
 
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
comment on a few of the provisions that
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
are proposed in this bill and it's
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
outlined in more detail in her letter um
 
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
first of all for
 
02:09:12.510 --> 02:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
pfba the Senate Minnesota does have a
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
guidance value but I believe it's part
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
per billion not trillion so it's a
 
02:09:20.430 --> 02:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
factor of a thousand different and
 
02:09:22.350 --> 02:09:22.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of consistent with our
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
analysis at this point EPA has some
 
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
draft toxicity data that they' published
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
for pfba for public comment and my
 
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau is a member of association with
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
similar agencies in other states
 
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
drinking water programs in other states
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
and our assessment is based on this
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
draft toxicity data which again isn't
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
ready to be finalized a standard would
 
02:09:45.950 --> 02:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
be well over a th parts per trillion um
 
02:09:49.109 --> 02:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
possibly over 3,000 parts per trillion
 
02:09:51.629 --> 02:09:51.639 align:start position:0%
and it's good to know that um but the
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
implication of of that value doesn't
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
have a lot of meaning in New Hampshire
 
02:09:57.790 --> 02:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
because we're not finding pfba at those
 
02:09:59.470 --> 02:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
levels in the state we definitely detect
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
pfba but it's usually at very low levels
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
below 20 parts per trillion so even if
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
we charged ahead and made a 7,000 or a
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
th000 or 3700 part per trillion standard
 
02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:11.559 align:start position:0%
which is kind of where the science is
 
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
driving us it wouldn't have any
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
practical effect it wouldn't impact
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
anybody's water
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
supply for pfbs um we would are in a
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
good position to make a standard um EPA
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
has created what we call reference dose
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
which you use to calculate what a
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
drinking water standard would be and
 
02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:30.599 align:start position:0%
we've had internal meetings about it
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
talking about adopting a standard and we
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
bear well may when we reopt a rulle
 
02:10:36.629 --> 02:10:36.639 align:start position:0%
someday but again there's no urgency
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
because the value for pfbs would be
 
02:10:40.790 --> 02:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
around a th parts of trillion as
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill but again wouldn't
 
02:10:44.189 --> 02:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
have any practical effect on drinking
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
water we're not based on seven 8,000
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
private public water supply drinking
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
water test we haven't seen anything come
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
close to a th000 parts per trillion for
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
pfbs the only place we really seen pfbs
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
at that high levels where we have a
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
source of contamination the spot where
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
things were actually released in those
 
02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
cases the things we regulate already
 
02:11:08.950 --> 02:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
pfna PFA pfos and
 
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
pfhxs are also exceeded and so
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
remediations already occurring there so
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
changing that value wouldn't have any
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
practical effect the third thing that's
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
proposed is adding the six compounds to
 
02:11:24.669 --> 02:11:24.679 align:start position:0%
four we regulate plus pfba and pfbs and
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
having a cumulative standard a pfas 6
 
02:11:29.709 --> 02:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
standard of 20 parts per trillion
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's a couple problems with that one
 
02:11:35.069 --> 02:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
it pulls pfbs in and so you know the
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
defacto value for pfbs would become 20
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion because you're adding
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
that towards 20 so no matter if we had
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
the Thousand parts per trillion standard
 
02:11:44.470 --> 02:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
as proposed would actually be 20 because
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's part of that
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
equation and then the other concern we
 
02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
have with it is that each of these
 
02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
compounds have a different Health
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
outcome it's not a one: one ratio and so
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
although it's highly desirable to
 
02:12:00.189 --> 02:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
regulate them as a class because there's
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately thousands of these compounds
 
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
and going at them one at a time is not
 
02:12:07.030 --> 02:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
ideal we just don't have the scientific
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
basis to group them yet EPA and part of
 
02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
Asar nudging our commissioner centil
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
letter EPA asking him to start working
 
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
on regulating these as a class because
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
we're never going to get at it doing
 
02:12:20.589 --> 02:12:20.599 align:start position:0%
them boy one but EPA is now working
 
02:12:23.229 --> 02:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
really hard at assessing the toxicity of
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
cocktails of these pest values and and
 
02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the future there'll be a
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
sound scientific basis for having
 
02:12:32.629 --> 02:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
standards based on the class we just
 
02:12:35.549 --> 02:12:35.559 align:start position:0%
don't have that at this time to justify
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative kraton for a
 
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah Mr K I thank you for your
 
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
testimony so my my understanding from
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony is that this
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill would cost $12 million to do
 
02:12:55.669 --> 02:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
something that you guys have already
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
looked at and it determined is not an
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
issue at this
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
point it would cause local entities to
 
02:13:06.189 --> 02:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
spend money to either do investigations
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
or remediation or put in treatment
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
systems for something at this time that
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have a basis for but we keep
 
02:13:13.830 --> 02:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the data and at some point in
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
the future we may have different
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
standards that more align with this but
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
at the time no we don't have a
 
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
sir representative Kelly for a for a
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh so I
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
guess my question we you talked about
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
our standards are being uh you know
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
let's say a thousand parts per trillion
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
would be we wouldn't see those levels in
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
testing the question would be what would
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
be the harm of of having a standard that
 
02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
high if the the you know let's say you
 
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
know somebody did start using more pfba
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
in our in our production process and
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
then water did Spike to that that level
 
02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't having a a safety
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
level you know 2,000 parts per trillion
 
02:14:01.229 --> 02:14:01.239 align:start position:0%
or something that that high what would
 
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
be the harm in in having that on the
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
books or having
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't think there would be a harm
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
I we actually have the data we need to
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
make a standard for pfbs at this time
 
02:14:13.549 --> 02:14:13.559 align:start position:0%
there's a final reference dose by
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
EPA and we very well could make a
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
standard likely would when we reopt
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
those rules but it doesn't make sense to
 
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
go through the rule making process
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
prematurely you have to renew the rules
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
every 8 10 years so you where there's no
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
practical implication we're not going to
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
divert resources to make the rule you
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
know sort of out of sequence had we had
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
a issue and we know that value would
 
02:14:39.069 --> 02:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
reduce exposure we'd probably expedite
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
the rule making like we did for the
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
other four compounds so your Point's
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
well taken and the value of having a
 
02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:46.599 align:start position:0%
standard ultimately is that it's
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
instructive to people they have a result
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
you have something to compare it to so I
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
think your spot on it's just um it
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to put it in law
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
outside the process that we're already
 
02:14:58.910 --> 02:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
using and it doesn't make sense to rush
 
02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
to do it when there's no advantage to
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
having that
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
value follow follow up Mr chairman uh so
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
follow up just be so the the pfbs is has
 
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
a standard EPA has a standard released
 
02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
the final standard
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
pfba is in a draft standard released in
 
02:15:18.750 --> 02:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
November is that
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
so PFS they have a final reference dose
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
which is just a a value but we use that
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
value to calculate a standard so it's
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
it's kind of plug and chug once I is you
 
02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
that it's not really standard at EPA but
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
it's a value we can use to make it
 
02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
standard and then your correct pfba
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
they're they have draft data um at this
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
point that's out for public
 
02:15:42.189 --> 02:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
comment and just one more call so if
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's an 8 to 10 year process to renew
 
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
those standards it it would pfba when
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
that final report where it's obviously
 
02:15:52.270 --> 02:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
on coming soon would that make that 8 to
 
02:15:53.950 --> 02:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
10 year
 
02:15:56.229 --> 02:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
cycle yeah and I don't mean to say we're
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
going to wait 8 to 10 years we may have
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
other rule changes that we need to
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
maintain the rules sooner but yeah if
 
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's final toxicity data from EPA
 
02:16:06.430 --> 02:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
they would be they would incorporate
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
that into the rules but again it would
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
have no it wouldn't change anything so
 
02:16:11.589 --> 02:16:11.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter if we do it tomorrow
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
or five years from now at this point for
 
02:16:14.750 --> 02:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
those two compounds based on what we
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
know about the science
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
kerum for taking my
 
02:16:26.079 --> 02:16:27.790 align:start position:0%
kerum for taking my
question

02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:30.559 align:start position:0%
um it is heartening that we do have a
 
02:16:33.549 --> 02:16:33.559 align:start position:0%
toxicologist now at Dees now I just want
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure I have my uh what I heard
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
you say correct and my understanding is
 
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
pfbs you said we are not finding Parts
 
02:16:46.349 --> 02:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
above the a thousand parts per trillion
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
not in drinking water
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
there may be certain localized areas of
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
groundwater at the source of
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
contamination but then the P Rec current
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
re regulate are also exceeded there and
 
02:17:00.509 --> 02:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
so efforts are underway to remediate it
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
and remediating PFA pfna pfhxs and pfos
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
would remediate the pfbs as well
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
followup Mr
 
02:17:12.030 --> 02:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
chair so you're saying you're already
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
REM remediating the contaminated spots
 
02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
because they have the for uh per po
 
02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
polyfloral chemicals
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
that are do have mcls and so this one is
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
getting taken care of at the same time
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
right and it's rare that we even have
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
this one at that level but at those hot
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
spots yes and again not in drinking
 
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
water supplies at those levels just the
 
02:17:44.669 --> 02:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
am I on yeah could you please could you
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
please tell me based on your 10 years
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
experience looking at
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
perlin chemicals within our state and
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps using um peas Andor meramac as
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
an example in in my in the answer to
 
02:18:10.309 --> 02:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
this question are we finding that known
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
polluters uh are changing which perlu
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
per fluin chemical they're using once we
 
02:18:20.709 --> 02:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
clamp down on them do they substitute
 
02:18:22.830 --> 02:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
another variation that's now not covered
 
02:18:24.669 --> 02:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
by our standard are we is it like we're
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
kind of an ER rase against the polluters
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
examples so what's really driven
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
industry to change the type of pfas
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
they've used is the termination usually
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the federal level of known toxicity
 
02:18:41.709 --> 02:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
of the original
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
compounds and it is true new compounds
 
02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
are being used often before we have a
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
full understanding of their toxicity
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
profile um again that's driven by EPA we
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
don't approve chemicals in New Hampshire
 
02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
that's a EPA process the EPA is taking
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
big steps to get around that by uh by
 
02:19:02.070 --> 02:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
changing how they approve um new
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
chemicals and also requiring more
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
toxicity assessments upfront and even
 
02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
recently in recent legislation requiring
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
that manufacturers these products
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
provide standards to EPA so that we can
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
assess if they're occurring in large
 
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
quantities in the environment before we
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
didn't even know what to look for and we
 
02:19:21.709 --> 02:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have standards for it so yeah
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's at the federal level it's not a
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
perfect process but they're trying to
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
get their arms around past is a whole
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
class and it made big progress in doing
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
it but yeah we are um we are creating
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
new compounds that may have more
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
information on later than we have now on
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
yes follow on
 
02:19:42.349 --> 02:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
please you followup on the issue us so I
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate that answer but specifically
 
02:19:48.110 --> 02:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
with your experience in PE and or Mar
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
have we found that one has been
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
substituted for another and it's causing
 
02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:52.990 align:start position:0%
substituted for another and it's causing
problems

02:19:52.990 --> 02:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
again I'm not aware of a substitute
 
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
chemical causing a problem based on our
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory standards at this time okay
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.429 --> 02:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
information any other questions by any
 
02:20:11.110 --> 02:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee seeing
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
none right thank you very much thank
 
02:20:16.359 --> 02:20:19.750 align:start position:0%
none right thank you very much thank
you

02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.630 --> 02:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh is it Grace not
 
02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
Grace n n not thank you Mr chair n Grace
 
02:20:31.469 --> 02:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
Association we are opposed to this bill
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to be clear that we don't
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
we're not scientists so we would defer
 
02:20:43.030 --> 02:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
to Dees about the science entirely uh
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
the reason we're opposed to the bill is
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
the costs uh as you may recall
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh a few years ago when the initial four
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
compounds were put into statute uh the
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
legislature authorized the treasury
 
02:21:02.830 --> 02:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
Department to borrow $1 155 million uh
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
15 million dollar via bonding uh in
 
02:21:07.630 --> 02:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
order to help pay for this uh as we've
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
heard throughout testimony this morning
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
mitigating P past compounds is very
 
02:21:15.469 --> 02:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
expensive and we want to make sure that
 
02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
costs are covered with without causing
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
um municipalities to have to pay for
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
those that's really the substance of my
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I did provide that uh via
 
02:21:29.230 --> 02:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
email but there are hard copies
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
available uh that your researcher has if
 
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
you would like
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
those I'm happy to answer
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from members of
 
02:21:38.319 --> 02:21:41.710 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from members of
the

02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:50.190 align:start position:0%
 
much

02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh Boyd Smith um
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
whatever about there we go uh I'm the
 
02:22:11.790 --> 02:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
president CEO of New Hampshire Water
 
02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:12.790 align:start position:0%
president CEO of New Hampshire Water
Works

02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
Works
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
Association and we represent uh public
 
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water uh providers in in the
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we do oppose this
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh and I submitted electronic
 
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
testimony uh yesterday I'm going to
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
leave hard copies with the with over on
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
the table there and I learned that
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
bundling multiple bills of our interest
 
02:22:36.349 --> 02:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
into your letters is not helpful so I
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
apologize for that and uh as I continue
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
coming to testify uh about legislation
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with I'll create
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
separate documents so you guys can
 
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
organize them it'll work better for you
 
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
so apologize for that
 
02:22:51.550 --> 02:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
um uh you've really heard the technical
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
information that we would uh support uh
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
from from NHD uh from from Brandon
 
02:23:01.349 --> 02:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
kernin so I don't want to uh reiterate
 
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
that but we fully you know we fully uh
 
02:23:08.469 --> 02:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
support their DS's arguments there
 
02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
um fundamentally I want folks to
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
understand that the group that we that
 
02:23:15.269 --> 02:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
we represent and these are the people
 
02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
that provide public drinking water to
 
02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire many are
 
02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities some are precincts and
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
districts and some are private entities
 
02:23:26.269 --> 02:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
such as pachuk uh this group of people
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
is incredibly Health focused in their
 
02:23:32.269 --> 02:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
mission so when they're told you know
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
we've got pasos or the Arsenic level is
 
02:23:36.510 --> 02:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
changing or manganese now has a new
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
notification standard uh they do it
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
these are very you know operational
 
02:23:44.269 --> 02:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
outcome focused people and and as I've
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
gotten to know them over the last couple
 
02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
years I've had this job um as they say
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
their product goes into people's mouths
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want you to understand because
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
most people don't think about where the
 
02:23:56.590 --> 02:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
water comes from that the people that
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
provide this water uh to over half of
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
our residents uh are consumate
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
professionals that are highly driven for
 
02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:04.710 align:start position:0%
professionals that are highly driven for
public

02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
service um that being said when a new
 
02:24:11.070 --> 02:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
standard is proposed uh it has
 
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
implications it has treatment
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
implications for example as we know in
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
marac and Portsmouth area with posos uh
 
02:24:20.830 --> 02:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
it has Health implications if you you
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
know don't use the right
 
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
standard and then it has all the time to
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
roll that out and fund it so there's
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
cost and health implication so what the
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
other thing other than sharing about the
 
02:24:33.269 --> 02:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
you know the people that provide our
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
water is how important it is to follow
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
these established uh risk-based
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
health-based financial analysis when we
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
set a new standard and uh I know that
 
02:24:46.990 --> 02:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the methodology was referenced
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
the position of a toxicologist is new
 
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
and most necessary and welcome and uh
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
this this point I'm making applies to
 
02:24:59.070 --> 02:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
this rule here that we should not we
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
should not offer new standards lightly
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
we should test them out uh following
 
02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:06.269 align:start position:0%
we should test them out uh following
wellestablished

02:25:06.269 --> 02:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
wellestablished
 
02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
processes and that'll be a theme that
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear from me again on a
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
couple of other pieces of peos related
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh legislation but that's really all I
 
02:25:17.110 --> 02:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to share a little understanding
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
ing of of uh how seriously uh drinking
 
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
water providers take their job and uh
 
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
and they the seriousness with which they
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
follow science-based risk-based you know
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
wellth thought out procedures and
 
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
policies to establish new methods uh and
 
02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:36.920 align:start position:0%

Hollis uh this bill is at the request of
 
02:27:07.279 --> 02:27:09.070 align:start position:0%
Hollis uh this bill is at the request of
a

02:27:09.070 --> 02:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
constituent and I think our job as state
 
02:27:15.389 --> 02:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
legislators is to Advocate on behalf of
 
02:27:17.269 --> 02:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
our constituents when it comes to their
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state government
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
so uh in that Spirit uh we introduced
 
02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:22.670 align:start position:0%
so uh in that Spirit uh we introduced
this

02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:26.190 --> 02:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
bill if you uh if you look at I don't
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
know if you can see my phone here but I
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
believe this bill was was sparked by a
 
02:27:34.990 --> 02:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
notice that's on the state parks website
 
02:27:36.429 --> 02:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
and I'll read it to you here it says
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
drone use is restricted at all New
 
02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state parks drone operators
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
are not permitted take off or to take
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
off or land within New Hampshire Park
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
boundaries so there's an outright
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition it's it's you know publicly
 
02:27:52.269 --> 02:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
noticed on the
 
02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
website um I am not a drone operator
 
02:27:58.750 --> 02:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
owner um I understand that the
 
02:28:00.030 --> 02:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
technology is pretty interesting and
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's um you know advancing pretty
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
steadily um but this is a hobby for
 
02:28:09.870 --> 02:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
some uh and this is you know a uh an
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
occupation for others so um so you know
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
in uh deference to that Hobby
 
02:28:21.429 --> 02:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh we would like to find a way to allow
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
permitted use of drones in state parks
 
02:28:28.990 --> 02:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
and uh while respecting privacy issues
 
02:28:31.230 --> 02:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
and while respecting safety
 
02:28:33.990 --> 02:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
issues there will be people testifying I
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
believe behind me or after me that are
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
more uh expert in this area um but
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
understand that uh for certain uses the
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
FAA requires a test uh a certification
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
for uh drone operators to operate within
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
certain uh airspace
 
02:28:57.150 --> 02:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
limitations uh and so some of this uh
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
Bill deals with people who have that
 
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
certification or they're you know
 
02:29:03.309 --> 02:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
they've proven to the federal government
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
that they're competent drone
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
operators so with that I'll take any
 
02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.389 --> 02:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
them thank you uh uh M uh representative
 
02:29:16.399 --> 02:29:17.389 align:start position:0%
them thank you uh uh M uh representative
uh

02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
do you say that there there's someone
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
behind you who would be uh willing to
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
step forward I believe that's the case
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
technical there is a Drew mamt is that
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
the person he's he's my constituent and
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
it was his request that this the bill
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:35.790 align:start position:0%
okay so
probably

02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
the will uh with the unanimous consent
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
of the of the uh the committee will just
 
02:29:49.269 --> 02:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:53.790 --> 02:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
information rep representative
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
Egan thank you Mr chair thank you sir
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:30:01.670 --> 02:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
yes should
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
um um why is the designation of 55
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
pounds in the legislation that's awfully
 
02:30:11.710 --> 02:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
large for a
 
02:30:14.230 --> 02:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
drone it may correspond with some
 
02:30:15.469 --> 02:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation I don't have the
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
answer for you right now but it that
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
would be my best guess that it it
 
02:30:22.030 --> 02:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
corresponds with some uh
 
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
designation within the federal
 
02:30:29.710 --> 02:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
you uh seeing no other
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative you have
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
something yeah I think there's ideas for
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
improving this bill and I'm certainly
 
02:30:41.630 --> 02:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
open to improving it um so thank you all
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%

Hollis New Hampshire I'm a data
 
02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
scientist for IBM and I've been involved
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
with Aviation my entire life my my
 
02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
father's a pilot my grandfather was a
 
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
pilot um my younger brothers are both
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
Pilots my uncle's a pilot I'm a pilot
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
I've been flying with my father since I
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
was about two weeks old um I soloed in
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
gliders when I was 16 years old and I
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
got my license for uh real planes when I
 
02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
was 22 in
 
02:31:42.190 --> 02:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
college um more relevant to this bill
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
I've been flying model airplanes since I
 
02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
was about 8 years old um I've seen this
 
02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
hobby change considerably in the last 15
 
02:31:53.150 --> 02:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
years both from a technology standpoint
 
02:31:57.070 --> 02:31:57.080 align:start position:0%
and from a regulatory standpoint in 2016
 
02:31:59.830 --> 02:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government put in a program
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
um for certification of commercial drone
 
02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
licenses and I was one of the first
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
people in the United States to get this
 
02:32:07.750 --> 02:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
type of license so it's called part 107
 
02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
license and allows me to be uh flying
 
02:32:13.389 --> 02:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
drones for hire so I could be hired by a
 
02:32:16.429 --> 02:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
real estate company or um I could sell
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
my work um to movie studios or whatnot
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
you can take photos and um do this for
 
02:32:27.550 --> 02:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
higher um I got my first salary job um
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
as a direct result of having this part
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
107 license I did a lot of testing work
 
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
for a company down in New Jersey um that
 
02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
does analytics with satellite data um we
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
use drones as a platform for testing out
 
02:32:41.469 --> 02:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
some of these capabilities and testing
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
out different
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
algorithms um but I became aware of of
 
02:32:50.269 --> 02:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
this uh rule for state parks in about
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
2020 prior to this this was an
 
02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
unregulated activity and people could
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
fly drones on state land without really
 
02:33:00.670 --> 02:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
much issue um I think the problem kind
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
of started coming around when a lot of
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
people had more access to these drones
 
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I guess somebody decided that they
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to um bar everyone from using
 
02:33:12.750 --> 02:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
drones without having prior permission
 
02:33:15.230 --> 02:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
there is apparently a process in place
 
02:33:18.150 --> 02:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
for getting that per Mission um but it
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
it I believe it is on duerden on both
 
02:33:24.750 --> 02:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
commercial and recreational drone Pilots
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
um it takes very long to get this permit
 
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
um uh one of my friends Marie sapena
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
cannot be here today she's a former
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
State Rep and she submitted you guys um
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
a very long written testimony that's
 
02:33:40.590 --> 02:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
very thorough and goes into long detail
 
02:33:43.309 --> 02:33:43.319 align:start position:0%
about um this whole process so she was
 
02:33:45.269 --> 02:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
able to get a permit at one point she's
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
been featured in the new Wildlife
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
Journal um with some of her drone
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
photography so that's the official
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
journal for um the fishing F or the uh
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game Bureau
 
02:33:59.469 --> 02:33:59.479 align:start position:0%
um so yeah she has a lot of detail I
 
02:34:02.349 --> 02:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
have that testimony in front of me um so
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
I can go into detail with some of the
 
02:34:06.990 --> 02:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
some of the facts that she had um just
 
02:34:08.870 --> 02:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
trying to go through so what the two
 
02:34:11.469 --> 02:34:11.479 align:start position:0%
main desires with this bills um just
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
much easier ability to um have
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
recreational and Commercial Dr Pilots be
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
able to fly in State Park land um again
 
02:34:22.269 --> 02:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
this was previously an unregulated and
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowable activity um and then the
 
02:34:26.670 --> 02:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
second desire is to promote tourism the
 
02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
Strone Hobby and stem Fields throughout
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um through this
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
photography uh which has significant
 
02:34:37.389 --> 02:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
viewership on social media so um the New
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tourism page has a lot of
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
these photos being featured on on their
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
Instagram account and various other
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
social media sites um so these pictures
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
do get used quite a bit so it's photos
 
02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:50.950 align:start position:0%
do get used quite a bit so it's photos
and

02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:52.469 align:start position:0%
and
videos

02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
videos
 
02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
um another interesting point so this is
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
a precedent already most towns and uh
 
02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
Town parks and trails do allow drone
 
02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
flight already this is unregulated and
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
I've not been able to find any
 
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
municipality in New Hampshire that does
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
currently ban drones on
 
02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:10.710 align:start position:0%
currently ban drones on
townland

02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
townland
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
um and then another precedent as well is
 
02:35:17.309 --> 02:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
that drones are already allowed um in
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
the White Mountain National Forest in
 
02:35:21.269 --> 02:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
designated areas um you do have to go
 
02:35:23.070 --> 02:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
through a per permitting process through
 
02:35:28.269 --> 02:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
them uh to be allowed to do this um and
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
in Marie's testimony she went into
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
detail about how it's much easier to get
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
a hunting permit to hunt in state parks
 
02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
than it is to uh be able to fly drones
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
and be permitted to to do this activity
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
in state parks
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
um so the state government has no j
 
02:35:48.429 --> 02:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
ition over drone and airspace rules once
 
02:35:50.429 --> 02:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
the Drone is in Flight you have the
 
02:35:53.269 --> 02:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate uh where drones can
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
take off and land and this bill goes
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
into explicit detail about um some of
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the limitations on um when recreational
 
02:36:06.389 --> 02:36:06.399 align:start position:0%
Pilots would be able to uh be allowed to
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
um do uh the takeoff and
 
02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:11.469 align:start position:0%
um do uh the takeoff and
landings

02:36:11.469 --> 02:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
landings
 
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
um some of the sticking
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
points uh with some of the opposition
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
would be about the burden on Wildlife um
 
02:36:22.750 --> 02:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
again hunting and Motor Vehicles
 
02:36:26.190 --> 02:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
represent in my mind a bigger burden on
 
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
um nature there in both terms of noise
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
and in terms of lethality on um yeah
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
resources uh the reporting requirement
 
02:36:44.590 --> 02:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
for the non-licensed pilots and spill is
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
consistent with existing federal
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements um when you're
 
02:36:51.309 --> 02:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
flying drones within the proximity of
 
02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
airports you do have to let the airport
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
know that you're you're flying and you
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
can either do this through an app or in
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
other cases you have to give them a
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
phone call um so this reporting
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
requirement to try to mimic um some of
 
02:37:07.230 --> 02:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
those existing regulations in
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
place um another member of the
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
opposition mentioned um these causing
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
forest fires the only case that I could
 
02:37:18.750 --> 02:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
find was a case out west in I believe
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
Arizona where it a drone crashed and
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
caused small brush fire they were able
 
02:37:26.590 --> 02:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
to extinguish the fire very quickly um
 
02:37:28.110 --> 02:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
but this does not represent a
 
02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.349 align:start position:0%
but this does not represent a
significant

02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
risk um trying to see what else I
 
02:37:36.429 --> 02:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
wrote um yeah again this is just I think
 
02:37:39.070 --> 02:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
a great way to promote stem careers in
 
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and uh get younger people
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
outside and using drones um in a safe
 
02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:46.590 align:start position:0%
outside and using drones um in a safe
way

02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:37:48.349 --> 02:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
um so in my testimony I went through and
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
I put a nice table together on just
 
02:37:53.389 --> 02:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
comparing commercial drone users versus
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
recreational drone users both of which
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
um are permitted Under The Spill um as
 
02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
Keith was mentioning there is a
 
02:38:03.790 --> 02:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
certification program for commercial
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
drone users this is called the part 107
 
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
certification it takes many days to
 
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
study for this exam if you're already a
 
02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
part 61 pilot so Private Pilot like
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
myself you can get this as an add-on a
 
02:38:16.630 --> 02:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
02:38:20.990 --> 02:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
easily um but for general public uh it
 
02:38:22.590 --> 02:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
is a difficult exam you do have to learn
 
02:38:24.110 --> 02:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
a lot about the airspace requirements
 
02:38:27.790 --> 02:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
and safe flying and um again yeah this
 
02:38:29.389 --> 02:38:29.399 align:start position:0%
is an area that's become more and more
 
02:38:31.950 --> 02:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
regulated and I do think these
 
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
regulations um help make it a safer
 
02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:37.230 align:start position:0%
regulations um help make it a safer
hobby

02:38:37.230 --> 02:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
hobby
 
02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
um so you can take a look at that table
 
02:38:43.230 --> 02:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
Marie put together another table that
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
was kind of interesting trying to find
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
it yeah yeah
 
02:38:49.230 --> 02:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
comparing um the two activities hunting
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
versus drone operations in state parks
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
and yes you need education for both
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
um just trying to see if there's
 
02:38:59.950 --> 02:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
anything else interesting so um last
 
02:39:02.269 --> 02:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
year in New Hampshire there were 49,000
 
02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
8,600 uh part 107 drone users so that's
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's a portioned um evenly among
 
02:39:14.910 --> 02:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
states so it might be a little bit less
 
02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire small in the
 
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
average State um in terms of noise
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
gunshots about 140 to 175 DB uh a drone
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
like this and actually let me unfold
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
this for you so you can see it so this
 
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
fits in a backpack I can actually go
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
hiking with this it's quite small um I
 
02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
can answer the question about the weight
 
02:39:34.269 --> 02:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
requirement I think there was something
 
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
about that before I mean most drones are
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
about the size um this is a couple
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
pounds um yeah the FAA regulation does
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
allow this to be up to 55 PBS that's a
 
02:39:46.630 --> 02:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
federal um thing
 
02:39:50.670 --> 02:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
but most drones are about the size um I
 
02:39:52.110 --> 02:39:52.120 align:start position:0%
don't think there's a lot of I don't
 
02:39:53.309 --> 02:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
think the state has a lot of control
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
over um size limitations once the the
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
Drone is in
 
02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:58.550 align:start position:0%
Drone is in
Flight

02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
Flight
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
um again yeah that's out of your your
 
02:40:04.750 --> 02:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um so again um in terms of
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
noise this is about 70 DB traffic
 
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
outside is about 80 DB uh decb is a
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
logarithmic scale so roughly every 10 DB
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
is doubling in the intensity that you
 
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
perceive the noise so this is about half
 
02:40:23.750 --> 02:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
as loud as um autom Opals outside we in
 
02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
that scale considerably less um loud
 
02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:28.670 align:start position:0%
that scale considerably less um loud
than

02:40:28.670 --> 02:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
gunshots um in terms of safety there
 
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
were two deaths in New Hampshire in 2021
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
due to hunting which is permitted in
 
02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
due to hunting which is permitted in
state

02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
parks and we could only find one case
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 where a drone caused um
 
02:40:49.150 --> 02:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
somebody to get bruised and cut but it
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
was not a death Marie put in a nice map
 
02:40:55.309 --> 02:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the White Mountain National Forest
 
02:40:58.429 --> 02:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
showing where drones are permitted and
 
02:41:01.190 --> 02:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
most of it you can fly drones um there
 
02:41:03.910 --> 02:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
are some regulated Wildlife areas where
 
02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
you can't launch drones and that's also
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
um a regulation for uh regular planes as
 
02:41:11.429 --> 02:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
well there are certain altitude
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions about flying too low over
 
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
some of these um this areas so that that
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
is an important Federal
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
rule um just trying to see what else she
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
put together she is a lawyer she put a
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
lot of good information together um term
 
02:41:30.510 --> 02:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of like fact sheets let's see
 
02:41:30.520 --> 02:41:38.790 align:start position:0%
in terms of like fact sheets let's see
what

02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
else I think that's about it as far as
 
02:41:44.190 --> 02:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
information I have to to say do you have
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
any questions by members of the
 
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee representative Smith for a
 
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um the you
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
have focused on the state park rule but
 
02:42:04.469 --> 02:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
the State trail system is a lot more
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
expansive than state
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
parks so I wondered you know what you're
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
what the why are you focusing on state
 
02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
parks when the state trails
 
02:42:18.030 --> 02:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
are all you know a lot more expansive
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
than the parks themselves I'm going to
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
have to defer to Keith a little bit on
 
02:42:24.030 --> 02:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
the terminology but yeah I personally
 
02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
believe that drones should be permitted
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
on all public land like that land
 
02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
belongs to all of us like this was an
 
02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
activity that was permissible in all
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
these public spaces previously um and I
 
02:42:38.429 --> 02:42:38.439 align:start position:0%
think this is a great way to um begin
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
implementing this and I think I don't
 
02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
know the exact terminology between state
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
parks versus a Statewide trail system um
 
02:42:48.349 --> 02:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
but my intent is to be able to fly
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
parks thank you not sure if that answer
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.030 --> 02:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
anyone um thank you I uh I was just
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
wondering I am a drone certified drone
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
pilot as well um how could you clarify a
 
02:43:16.990 --> 02:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about uh how for instance
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
people would their privacy would be
 
02:43:22.830 --> 02:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
protected when they're using a state
 
02:43:25.590 --> 02:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
park or a trail say they were riding
 
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
their uh bike and I know for instance
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the drones you can you can
 
02:43:34.710 --> 02:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
follow someone and be followed and
 
02:43:36.990 --> 02:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
tracked that way I think I believe that
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
is why for instance it in ski areas they
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
don't allow drones you could track
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
people and have a a drone flying
 
02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
overhead so there's a is a privacy issue
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed I think the
 
02:43:51.309 --> 02:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
bill seems has Merit I mean it'd be nice
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow this but at the same
 
02:43:56.910 --> 02:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
time we need to protect people's privacy
 
02:43:59.790 --> 02:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
when they're using parks and trails as
 
02:44:01.950 --> 02:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
well thanks thank you that's a very good
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
question um this bill does directly um
 
02:44:06.389 --> 02:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
address that if you look at the bottom
 
02:44:09.349 --> 02:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
of the bill there is a clause in there
 
02:44:11.269 --> 02:44:11.279 align:start position:0%
um addressing the Privacy issue you
 
02:44:14.790 --> 02:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
cannot um spy on somebody essentially
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
without their written consent um and
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
that parallels an existing law in Sp in
 
02:44:21.389 --> 02:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire there's only one law in
 
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
the books regarding drones currently and
 
02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
you cannot spy on somebody hunting
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
without their written consent um so we
 
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
took that language directly out of that
 
02:44:32.429 --> 02:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
um I guess also in regards to that like
 
02:44:38.309 --> 02:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
there was a big discussion when um
 
02:44:41.309 --> 02:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
cameras came about over 150 years ago
 
02:44:43.630 --> 02:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot of concerns um with
 
02:44:45.790 --> 02:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
privacy way back
 
02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
then um and a lot of people didn't want
 
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
to have cameras on the street they felt
 
02:44:53.150 --> 02:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
it was a big breach in the
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
Privacy um but we've as a society have
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
um kind of come to accept that when you
 
02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
step outside you are in the public
 
02:45:05.309 --> 02:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
domain and you do give up some sense of
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
privacy so I do under concern about
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
being spied on um but this doesn't
 
02:45:13.469 --> 02:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
represent any different of a privacy
 
02:45:16.110 --> 02:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
breach um
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
than somebody like with a camera or a
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
phone or whatever recording you on the
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
trail but yeah I do understand that
 
02:45:22.670 --> 02:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
concern and the whole
 
02:45:25.630 --> 02:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
loitering um concern is addressed with
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
with that Clause that um prohibits
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
people thank you chair um well I see
 
02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
here it says no person shall use the uh
 
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
uas with the intent to conduct video
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
surveillance um but is not
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
defined uh obviously you'll be filming
 
02:45:54.309 --> 02:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
people in the park possibly but it would
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
be no different than somebody filming
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
with her iPhone or whatever with you
 
02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
know igers walking down the trail in
 
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
fact um I think with footage on the
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
ground people's faces and all that would
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
be more visible that's perfectly
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
permissible thing I can walk down the
 
02:46:11.710 --> 02:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
street here in conquer and I can record
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
people's faces without any any ruling
 
02:46:18.510 --> 02:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
against that um in fact people's faces
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
from above are not visible at all um so
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
I think it's actually less of a risk
 
02:46:28.630 --> 02:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
iPhone the only issue I would have with
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is well you you can confront
 
02:46:36.510 --> 02:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
someone with a camera who's who's in
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
your face but you can't confront a
 
02:46:41.230 --> 02:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
person with a drone the drone's up in
 
02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
the air you what would you do if a drone
 
02:46:46.349 --> 02:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
was following you you'd have no recourse
 
02:46:48.790 --> 02:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
of you can't see where they are perhaps
 
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
but you'd also be a lot further away and
 
02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
photos representative Huff for
 
02:47:03.309 --> 02:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
for coming and testifying today um you
 
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
said that it used to it used to be
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
allowed and now it's disallowed um do
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know how that is disallowed is it an
 
02:47:18.150 --> 02:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
RSA is it a an agency uh uh rule or or
 
02:47:20.349 --> 02:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
what I don't have the specific details
 
02:47:23.190 --> 02:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
maybe Keith can um further elaborate on
 
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
some of that but I believe there was
 
02:47:28.550 --> 02:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
some decision made by a regulator within
 
02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
the State Parks Commission that decided
 
02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
one day that they needed a post
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere that you can't fly drones I
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
don't know if um it went through the
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
exact formal rul making process or if
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
there is such a thing um but they put up
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
the signs and that's kind of the extent
 
02:47:48.750 --> 02:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
that I know follow up Mr chair for a
 
02:47:54.510 --> 02:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
followup um so if that's the case um I'm
 
02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that there were reasons why
 
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
they wanted to put that up instead of
 
02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:01.590 align:start position:0%
they wanted to put that up instead of
just

02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:48:04.230 --> 02:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
maybe repealing that law and just
 
02:48:06.510 --> 02:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
letting it go I'm assuming that this is
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
an an attempt to kind of play into not
 
02:48:13.870 --> 02:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
play in that's not a great uh uh word um
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge the possibilities of of
 
02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
their concerns and regulate it in more
 
02:48:22.590 --> 02:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
of a safe way or a more uh uh
 
02:48:24.990 --> 02:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
eco-friendly and and and and public
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
friendly so that the issues that may
 
02:48:30.429 --> 02:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
have been arised previously to make them
 
02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
ban it might not be quite as prevalent I
 
02:48:35.469 --> 02:48:35.479 align:start position:0%
think that's a correct assessment of
 
02:48:36.910 --> 02:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to achieve here trying
 
02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
to weigh the concerns of um safety and
 
02:48:43.469 --> 02:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
management on on their end but then also
 
02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
allow people like like myself and other
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
commercial and recreational drone users
 
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to have access that we
 
02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
previously had thank you very
 
02:48:55.150 --> 02:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
much thank you by the way the
 
02:48:56.750 --> 02:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner Parks will be the next one
 
02:49:00.990 --> 02:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
up to speak to adjust your concerns uh
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions from this this uh
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative harb for
 
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you and thank you for
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question I you may not have
 
02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
this but I wonder do you have any
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
statistics on drone failures my concern
 
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
is it's flying around and it crashes
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
even though it may not be negligent on
 
02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
the part of the Drone flyer or the pilot
 
02:49:25.389 --> 02:49:25.399 align:start position:0%
but like cars and things like that do
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
you have any statistics I don't have any
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
hard numbers with me um I do have the
 
02:49:31.590 --> 02:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
number that Marie uh gave me and there
 
02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
was only one case that she could find in
 
02:49:36.030 --> 02:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of somebody getting um
 
02:49:38.229 --> 02:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
basically cut and bruised because of the
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
Drone I think they were trying to like
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
maybe catch it or something and it maybe
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
hurt their hand or maybe they were near
 
02:49:45.550 --> 02:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
bystander I'm not in entirely sure the
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
exact case um again but this doesn't
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
present any more of a risk than any
 
02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
other falling object out of the sky like
 
02:49:55.110 --> 02:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
somebody could throw a rock off a cliff
 
02:49:56.349 --> 02:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
and it could hit somebody in the head
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
and they could die that way I mean
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other risks out there
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
like that I think this is actually
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
probably safer than um plenty of other
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
activities that go on um already in in
 
02:50:09.910 --> 02:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
state parks thank
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions repr mville answer this but
 
02:50:26.630 --> 02:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:29.389 --> 02:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
of folks that aren't licensed because
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
you're mentioning the bill mentions that
 
02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
they have to notify the commissioner so
 
02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
is the commissioner going to be
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
available day night evening and and how
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
do you see that as a as a pro who
 
02:50:43.790 --> 02:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
capably launches and lands your aircraft
 
02:50:45.229 --> 02:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
how do you see that as someone who's not
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
a pro managing that and going through
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
this enforcement process so I believe
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written is the
 
02:50:53.269 --> 02:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner or somebody delegated by
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner can take the um the
 
02:50:59.309 --> 02:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
permit or whatever the request so here's
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
how I Envision it like a non-licensed
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
person or they've gone through the trust
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
certification I guess if they don't have
 
02:51:08.070 --> 02:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
this part 107 license so currently as it
 
02:51:09.870 --> 02:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
stands like even if you don't have the
 
02:51:11.070 --> 02:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
license that I have you're still
 
02:51:12.750 --> 02:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to take this online tutorial
 
02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
and it's like an hourong test so
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
everyone that's flying drones now has to
 
02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
take some form of Education whether it's
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
the license that I have it's more
 
02:51:26.229 --> 02:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
difficult or um this trust certification
 
02:51:28.070 --> 02:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
online it's like tutorial like YouTube
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
video type thing there's a quiz at the
 
02:51:32.070 --> 02:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
end it's just basically um instilling
 
02:51:34.510 --> 02:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
safe safety practices so everyone has
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
that from the get-go but somebody with
 
02:51:38.190 --> 02:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
that trust certification how I Envision
 
02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
is they email or they call somebody
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
within the state park commission um with
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
a request so this is either a day or or
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
30 minutes before when they go
 
02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
flying um so they're going to email with
 
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
that request and they'll say um the
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
location they plan on
 
02:51:56.870 --> 02:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
flying and um yeah what they're going to
 
02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
do um that's their notification they can
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
go out and fly um if somebody within the
 
02:52:04.750 --> 02:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
state park commission doesn't want them
 
02:52:07.070 --> 02:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
to fly because of the different reasons
 
02:52:10.510 --> 02:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the bill um they can uh
 
02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
notify the person with a request that
 
02:52:14.269 --> 02:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
they do not have permission to fly and
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's how I intend it to work um so
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
it's a notification requirement um and
 
02:52:22.269 --> 02:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a Time threshold
 
02:52:24.990 --> 02:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
for somebody within State Park
 
02:52:28.349 --> 02:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
commission to give feedback and say no
 
02:52:30.349 --> 02:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
if they need to but otherwise it's an
 
02:52:30.359 --> 02:52:34.870 align:start position:0%
if they need to but otherwise it's an
immediate

02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith for a
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you Mr chair um
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
just said that that if you are not
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
licensed you're required to take a uh
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
test or tutorial or something like that
 
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
who is that required by it's required by
 
02:52:57.389 --> 02:52:57.399 align:start position:0%
the Federal Aviation Administration so
 
02:52:59.229 --> 02:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
if you buy one of those those little
 
02:53:01.750 --> 02:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
Cheapo drones that are like a $100 or
 
02:53:03.070 --> 02:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
something I don't know how much they
 
02:53:06.229 --> 02:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
cost you have you're someone gives you a
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
test or gives you a course it's
 
02:53:11.190 --> 02:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually I don't know how well it's
 
02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
enforced but it's highly encouraged for
 
02:53:16.429 --> 02:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
you to take it and it is a requirement
 
02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
um again yeah I don't really know what
 
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
the enforcement is like on their end but
 
02:53:23.950 --> 02:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
it says all over the FAA website that
 
02:53:25.830 --> 02:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
recreational users have to take one of
 
02:53:28.030 --> 02:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
these these courses and there's about 10
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
of them that they they've certified so
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
you can either do it through the Boy
 
02:53:34.269 --> 02:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
Scouts or the Academy of model
 
02:53:36.309 --> 02:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics um so you have a bunch of
 
02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
different options um as far
 
02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
as so I it looks like in oh sorry
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
followup um it looks like in the bill on
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
line 21 it says prior to launch they
 
02:53:50.670 --> 02:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
have to notify the commissioner so
 
02:53:52.349 --> 02:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
there's no permission given you were
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
talking about denying permission but
 
02:53:55.910 --> 02:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say anything about
 
02:53:57.870 --> 02:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
permitting or permission it's just
 
02:54:00.670 --> 02:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
notifying the commissioner within either
 
02:54:03.150 --> 02:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
30 minutes and no more than 24 hours
 
02:54:05.469 --> 02:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
before they're going to correct a lot of
 
02:54:07.389 --> 02:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
areas with an aviation you just
 
02:54:09.309 --> 02:54:09.319 align:start position:0%
basically have to notify and that kind
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
of parallels a lot of things within
 
02:54:15.469 --> 02:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
Aviation um B basically a no answer
 
02:54:18.269 --> 02:54:18.279 align:start position:0%
means you have permission to to do what
 
02:54:20.710 --> 02:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
you you intend to do um and that
 
02:54:23.150 --> 02:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
parallels existing regulations in place
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
like previously you had to notify an
 
02:54:26.349 --> 02:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
airport they didn't have to call you
 
02:54:28.110 --> 02:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
back but you just had to let them know
 
02:54:30.030 --> 02:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
what you intended to do and this bill
 
02:54:32.309 --> 02:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
intends to parallel that so that should
 
02:54:35.429 --> 02:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
not be um too
 
02:54:38.990 --> 02:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
concerning okay and final
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
followup yeah um the the last thing is
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
um since the there is nothing in the
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill about being uh the uh taking the
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
course or the tutorial or whatever it is
 
02:54:55.309 --> 02:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
would you object to that going into the
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill that um if they don't have a
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
license they should show provide proof
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
that they've taken a class or done
 
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
something I have no objection for you
 
02:55:06.190 --> 02:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
mentioning the the trust certification
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill if you need to amend it that
 
02:55:10.389 --> 02:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
way that's pretty reasonable
 
02:55:10.399 --> 02:55:12.030 align:start position:0%
way that's pretty reasonable
um

02:55:12.030 --> 02:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
but um yeah again it's a federal
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
requirement so I don't know if it needs
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
to be spelled out again in state law but
 
02:55:21.190 --> 02:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
again I think that would be reasonable
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
if you need to spell out that that trust
 
02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:31.070 --> 02:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
cerification anyone
 
02:55:33.469 --> 02:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one thank you very much
 
02:55:37.030 --> 02:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.030 --> 02:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
you uh call the next uh person to
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
testify uh Philip Bryce director
 
02:56:06.190 --> 02:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
Parks still morning good morning Mr
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
name is Philip Bryce I director of the

02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I have copies of my testimony and I
 
02:56:23.030 --> 02:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
might add a couple of additional
 
02:56:26.830 --> 02:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
comments uh Beyond what's written um so
 
02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
the division is very concerned with the
 
02:56:30.510 --> 02:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
impact that this bill would have on
 
02:56:33.030 --> 02:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
recreational experience of our visitors
 
02:56:35.229 --> 02:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
and continued access to the trails in
 
02:56:36.990 --> 02:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
the Statewide trail system that cross
 
02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
private land protecting the quality of
 
02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
that experience is one of the purposes
 
02:56:43.389 --> 02:56:43.399 align:start position:0%
of our administrative rules and I would
 
02:56:45.030 --> 02:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
point out that under under our current
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
administrative rules drones are not
 
02:56:50.030 --> 02:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
permitted on um our state parks our
 
02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
state forest our state
 
02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:54.630 align:start position:0%
state forest our state
reservations

02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
reservations
 
02:56:57.630 --> 02:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
um impact of drones on other
 
02:56:59.469 --> 02:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
recreationists we are concerned that
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
drone use on hiking trails on lands
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
owned by the state will negatively
 
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
impact other recreational users of the
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
trail system who are otherwise expecting
 
02:57:09.550 --> 02:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to enjoy a quiet experience
 
02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the trail our current administrative
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
rules governing the use of Department
 
02:57:16.990 --> 02:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
land state the following the properties
 
02:57:18.550 --> 02:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh or portions of a property shall be
 
02:57:20.469 --> 02:57:20.479 align:start position:0%
closed or restricted for Public Access
 
02:57:23.349 --> 02:57:23.359 align:start position:0%

02:57:26.670 --> 02:57:26.680 align:start position:0%

02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
budding land owners is being disturbed
 
02:57:31.030 --> 02:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
our rules go on to say under the
 
02:57:33.070 --> 02:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
reserved and privileged use of public
 
02:57:34.950 --> 02:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
lands and facilities and resources which
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
is where we issue special use permits
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
for drones States degradation of visitor
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
experience means the event activity or
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
use disrupts traditional
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
traditional very important word uh
 
02:57:51.110 --> 02:57:51.120 align:start position:0%

02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
the following conditions including
 
02:57:59.389 --> 02:57:59.399 align:start position:0%
conflict with the use of dread lands
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and Resources by the public
 
02:58:03.150 --> 02:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
at large note those resources would
 
02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:04.870 align:start position:0%
at large note those resources would
include

02:58:04.870 --> 02:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:58:08.190 --> 02:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
wildlife and increasingly there is uh
 
02:58:09.870 --> 02:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
research being done on the impact of
 
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
trails in general uh without adding uh
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
whether they're motorized or you add
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
other activities on those Trails
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
excessive noise so as to deny others
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
their right to quiet enjoyment of
 
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
recreational use of dread lands
 
02:58:24.469 --> 02:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
facilities and resources and of course
 
02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
the complaints by visitors although the
 
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh prohibits video Sur uh
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance of private City citizens we
 
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
wonder how the operate of the Drone can
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
be sure that no one else is in the area
 
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
and this provision as far as work
 
02:58:39.469 --> 02:58:39.479 align:start position:0%
concerned is
 
02:58:42.030 --> 02:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
unenforceable uh so anytime there's this
 
02:58:43.389 --> 02:58:43.399 align:start position:0%
assumption that because you put
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
something in statute or make a law or
 
02:58:48.070 --> 02:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
rule that that everybody's going to
 
02:58:50.590 --> 02:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
comply and those of you who are familiar
 
02:58:52.630 --> 02:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
and use our Parks extensively no we have
 
02:58:54.550 --> 02:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of difficulty in enforcing
 
02:58:59.830 --> 02:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
something as simple as a dog leash uh
 
02:59:02.830 --> 02:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
rule loss of recreational access we are
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the willingness of
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
private land owners to allow trails in
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Statewide trail system to cross
 
02:59:09.790 --> 02:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
their lands for public use we are very
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
concerned that those land owners would
 
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
no longer permit the public use of their
 
02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:14.389 align:start position:0%
no longer permit the public use of their
property

02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:59:18.229 --> 02:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
if drones were required to be permitted
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
and I would point out um some of you are
 
02:59:24.309 --> 02:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
familiar that state lands state park
 
02:59:27.070 --> 02:59:27.080 align:start position:0%
lands are part of dread dread that's
 
02:59:29.429 --> 02:59:29.439 align:start position:0%
what they originally called uh dncr
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
reservations State reservations include
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
state parks State Forest Wayside areas
 
02:59:38.670 --> 02:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
natural areas all of the all of the um
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
properties that are under the ownership
 
02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the state or under the control of the
 
02:59:46.750 --> 02:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
state state so even if we change the
 
02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
word the word and keep in mind the word
 
02:59:52.510 --> 02:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
Park is
 
02:59:56.870 --> 02:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
um uh Park is just a a term so you have
 
02:59:59.429 --> 02:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
pisca state park for example which is
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
Zone mostly 99% for forestry and for uh
 
03:00:06.030 --> 03:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife and natural
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
areas uh you have be Brook State Park
 
03:00:13.070 --> 03:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
which is 60% zoned the same way Parks
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
only managing is a small portion of the
 
03:00:16.510 --> 03:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of Acres that the
 
03:00:18.510 --> 03:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
agency has and those are the developed
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
Park sites however those that term
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
reservations also includes properties
 
03:00:25.630 --> 03:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
over which we have control and
 
03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
recreational uh recreational control so
 
03:00:31.710 --> 03:00:31.720 align:start position:0%
it would include those Trails where we
 
03:00:33.389 --> 03:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
have rules controlling use of those
 
03:00:36.110 --> 03:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
Trails across private land so even if
 
03:00:38.590 --> 03:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
you don't say Statewide trail system and
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
you go to Parks keep in mind that when
 
03:00:42.590 --> 03:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
you say Parks you're only you're not
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
talking about all the state lands that
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
are used for recreation which includes
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know state forests like Gile and
 
03:00:52.349 --> 03:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
others uh but you also then in addition
 
03:00:55.590 --> 03:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
bring in the um still bring in the
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
private land
 
03:01:00.429 --> 03:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
issue commercial use under
 
03:01:02.710 --> 03:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
administrative rule a special use is
 
03:01:04.710 --> 03:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
required a special use permit is
 
03:01:06.229 --> 03:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
required for commercial use special
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
means any event activity or use that is
 
03:01:11.110 --> 03:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
beyond the normal routine recreation use
 
03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
of a spe specific property
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
um so we do issue commercial permits uh
 
03:01:21.750 --> 03:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh if you're conducting a commercial
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
activity on state land you need a permit
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
because that that land is owned by the
 
03:01:30.630 --> 03:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
um the people of the citizens of the
 
03:01:33.110 --> 03:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and actually the
 
03:01:34.710 --> 03:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
citizens of the nation because of
 
03:01:38.870 --> 03:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
federal funding and long ago it was
 
03:01:42.229 --> 03:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
determined that if you're receiving a a
 
03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
a commercial benefit from the use of
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
that that property picture for some uses
 
03:01:47.389 --> 03:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
you know having to go out and buy that
 
03:01:49.590 --> 03:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
property can take that activity the
 
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
expectation is that the the the um the
 
03:01:54.469 --> 03:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
state the state and the park system
 
03:01:57.030 --> 03:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
would receive a compensation for that
 
03:02:00.070 --> 03:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
use that is especially important given
 
03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:01.720 align:start position:0%
as as you all know that we're an
 
03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
operationally self-funded Park system um
 
03:02:07.150 --> 03:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
and that that commercial use permit also
 
03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
helps ensure that the commercial use
 
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
isn't interfering with the recreational
 
03:02:13.190 --> 03:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
use we do work very closely with the
 
03:02:17.830 --> 03:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
division tourism uh um to uh to Grant
 
03:02:20.910 --> 03:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
permits so people can do uh promotional
 
03:02:22.510 --> 03:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
work for the state of New Hampshire
 
03:02:33.429 --> 03:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
impact on the park um the issue is is we
 
03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
have we issue literally hundreds of
 
03:02:42.910 --> 03:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
permits and we're trying to continue to
 
03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:44.070 align:start position:0%
permits and we're trying to continue to
develop

03:02:44.070 --> 03:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
develop
 
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to continue to make things
 
03:02:47.830 --> 03:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
simpler if you go to our website things
 
03:02:49.510 --> 03:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
that before you had to call the office
 
03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
you can start to like you can start to
 
03:02:54.190 --> 03:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
reserve Pavilions uh
 
03:02:57.910 --> 03:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
online um uh and so we're we're
 
03:02:59.630 --> 03:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to move with our enterprise
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
system in that direction to be able to
 
03:03:05.469 --> 03:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
Grant permits more simply um but
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
nonetheless uh uh at some point at some
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
levels of activity there needs to be
 
03:03:12.469 --> 03:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
more dialogue between this the uh the
 
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
agency and the person who wants to uh um
 
03:03:18.389 --> 03:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh conduct that activity and I I would
 
03:03:20.269 --> 03:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
us just add that leg you know the
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
legislation should be cons considered to
 
03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:25.479 align:start position:0%
be uh to be compared with what the FAA
 
03:03:27.630 --> 03:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
rules we did not do that we did not
 
03:03:30.110 --> 03:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
filter that uh do that filter to check
 
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the legislation is
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
consistent with those rules we we can't
 
03:03:38.150 --> 03:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
Pro prohibit uh drones from flying over
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
State lands um but we can prohibit them
 
03:03:46.830 --> 03:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
from uh Landing and taking off on on the
 
03:03:49.710 --> 03:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
the lands under our our jurisdiction and
 
03:03:51.950 --> 03:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
when we think of drone use you know we
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
think of places like Hampton beach with
 
03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
100,000 people and um you know would it
 
03:04:01.950 --> 03:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
every if if a lot of people have drones
 
03:04:04.510 --> 03:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
is that really something you want to
 
03:04:06.750 --> 03:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
want to see and I would agree that there
 
03:04:08.990 --> 03:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
are certainly cases where drone use is
 
03:04:11.229 --> 03:04:11.239 align:start position:0%
not going to impact anybody it's going
 
03:04:14.110 --> 03:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
to be fine but our problem is is sort of
 
03:04:18.030 --> 03:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
sifting that out uh as to as to uh where
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate ensuring that it
 
03:04:24.110 --> 03:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact with with um uh have a
 
03:04:25.870 --> 03:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
negative impact on what the primary
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
purposes and the traditional uses of our
 
03:04:30.750 --> 03:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
properties are be glad to answer any
 
03:04:32.190 --> 03:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
questions or help the committee any
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:39.710 --> 03:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
this I think I have one one question at
 
03:04:43.550 --> 03:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
least the to be uh need more more
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
specific on uh
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
you you have the the
 
03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
prohibition or is now on all state
 
03:04:55.710 --> 03:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
property or well on the on the when I
 
03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
say State lands that are under the
 
03:04:59.630 --> 03:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of our agency of of the
 
03:05:03.229 --> 03:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
Parks and Recreation of of dncr dncr
 
03:05:06.990 --> 03:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
yeah our rules if I may respond y our
 
03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
rules apply to State reservations that's
 
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
how the lands are are designated in New
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it works right really
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
really well it's not so we can optimize
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
the use of those properties so you
 
03:05:23.990 --> 03:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
conduct harvest in a a a state park
 
03:05:28.990 --> 03:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
because it's very um it's very uh
 
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do so based on the
 
03:05:33.790 --> 03:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
conditions of the forest and the the
 
03:05:36.750 --> 03:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
need to improve wildli habitat Etc and
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
then you had cases like state forests
 
03:05:41.469 --> 03:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
that have pretty intense recreational
 
03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
use of course one of the best examples
 
03:05:45.070 --> 03:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
of that that is Livermore Falls that is
 
03:05:47.429 --> 03:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
actually in estate Forest uh and that's
 
03:05:50.269 --> 03:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
a wonderful recreational site um uh
 
03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
along the river there and on a beautiful
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
well any questions representative Kon
 
03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank thank you for your
 
03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um and I I understand that the
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
challenge with bothering people who want
 
03:06:12.110 --> 03:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
to walk quietly uh how do you do how do
 
03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
you balance motorcy
 
03:06:14.439 --> 03:06:15.190 align:start position:0%
you balance motorcy
uh

03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:06:18.389 --> 03:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
ATVs snowmobiles other recreational
 
03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are quite honestly a
 
03:06:23.190 --> 03:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
little bit louder than a drone might be
 
03:06:26.190 --> 03:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
um and yet and yet thousands of those
 
03:06:31.630 --> 03:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
people use the the resources every day
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
yeah how how does that compare to a 70 D
 
03:06:37.469 --> 03:06:37.479 align:start position:0%
drone that weighs less than five pounds
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um very good question so you cannot
 
03:06:44.590 --> 03:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
opiz a motorized vehicle Le on aate
 
03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
property unless it's designated for that
 
03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
use so you just can't go anywhere with a
 
03:06:55.950 --> 03:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
with a um a trail bike or a uh or an ATV
 
03:06:58.229 --> 03:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
so those trails are designated so the
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
user knows generally knows when they go
 
03:07:03.229 --> 03:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
onto that trail that they're likely to
 
03:07:05.710 --> 03:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
come across uh somebody else whether
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
you're an equestrian or whether or not
 
03:07:09.469 --> 03:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
you're a mountain biker or a hiker
 
03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
whatever um whatever it is and that and
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
that trail system is there there's a lot
 
03:07:18.229 --> 03:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
of trails that are not accessible for a
 
03:07:21.030 --> 03:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
motorized um uh use you know manad the
 
03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
entire trail system on an Agnon
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
including uh the the lands that the
 
03:07:28.229 --> 03:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
state leases from the forest Society you
 
03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
know um uh you know there's no motorized
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
access uh uh permitted on on on um that
 
03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
site so it it's you know you're starting
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
to um address sort of the challenge of
 
03:07:43.790 --> 03:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
balancing all of the different users and
 
03:07:45.950 --> 03:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
their impact on the environment and each
 
03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
other and we're trying to minimize the
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
impacts on each other as much as we
 
03:07:53.309 --> 03:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
possibly can which is of course why we
 
03:07:56.910 --> 03:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't just allow um motorized vehicles
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
to go wherever they want on on uh dncr
 
03:08:03.790 --> 03:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
reservations for a
 
03:08:06.750 --> 03:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
followup for a follow
 
03:08:10.030 --> 03:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
up so so s
 
03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
okay is there then uh
 
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
a modification this bill considering
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
that the people using those drones are
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
constituents they are citizens with
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
rights to access to the land what what
 
03:08:27.389 --> 03:08:27.399 align:start position:0%
kind of modification could be made
 
03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
to uh allow that as you've done for the
 
03:08:34.710 --> 03:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
other the other vehicles well as I said
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
I I mean the thought the the the IDE
 
03:08:39.110 --> 03:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
comes up will designate certain places
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
where drones can be
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
used uh but I I
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
would in many respects
 
03:08:50.910 --> 03:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
um in many
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
respects there's a there PE part of it
 
03:09:00.229 --> 03:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
is people getting used to certain
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
things um and so and there's and that's
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
why we talk about the traditional uses
 
03:09:08.229 --> 03:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
so so you know the issue was brought up
 
03:09:10.750 --> 03:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
about hunting hunting you know is much
 
03:09:12.429 --> 03:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
louder of course it's a shorter period
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
of time
 
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and um but it is it's much it's much
 
03:09:19.710 --> 03:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
louder than a drone but that is that is
 
03:09:22.309 --> 03:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
a traditional use and and you know and
 
03:09:24.229 --> 03:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
part of the culture of the State of New
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we we are particularly
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
challenged and this is also even
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
includes with ATVs is when new
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
technology comes along that creates an
 
03:09:38.790 --> 03:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
additional uh um uh you know desire to
 
03:09:42.190 --> 03:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
use public lands to to carry out that
 
03:09:42.200 --> 03:09:43.550 align:start position:0%
use public lands to to carry out that
activity

03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
activity
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
and so I cannot tell you really what
 
03:09:53.070 --> 03:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for for drone use
 
03:09:55.710 --> 03:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
my first concern is the impact on our
 
03:09:58.150 --> 03:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
access on trail systems that are on
 
03:10:00.590 --> 03:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
other people's property that that so
 
03:10:03.229 --> 03:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
that would have to be clearly addressed
 
03:10:04.950 --> 03:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
that this only includes lands that are
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
owned by the state and secondly I would
 
03:10:10.710 --> 03:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
want to really fully understand the use
 
03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
the the issue of the issue of um
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh privacy and enforcing that privacy
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
is is is everywhere I think there is a
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
difference between a drone taking a
 
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
picture I recognize it's taking a
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
picture and taking you know taking a
 
03:10:30.510 --> 03:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
picture I recognize that there's there
 
03:10:33.389 --> 03:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
you know that there is the issue of a
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
camera but people understand what that
 
03:10:37.990 --> 03:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
is today and we're all used to that
 
03:10:39.790 --> 03:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
happening and there's you know the point
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
of proximity was was made up so
 
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
um I I think this is really something if
 
03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
you want to try to do something one of
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
the one of the ways to approach it is to
 
03:10:57.229 --> 03:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
provide for this to occur in rul making
 
03:10:59.469 --> 03:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
so it's put in the context of all of the
 
03:11:03.269 --> 03:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
other dread dread dncr and they say
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
dread now because they haven't been
 
03:11:09.229 --> 03:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
updated um recently uh the dncr rul
 
03:11:12.990 --> 03:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
making process so that that is that is
 
03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
one approach and it's put in the context
 
03:11:17.469 --> 03:11:17.479 align:start position:0%
of all the other uses we have an when we
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
when we redo the rules we go through an
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
extensive public engagement process that
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
I think some of you might be familiar
 
03:11:26.229 --> 03:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
with so we get a lot of feedback from
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
users in the in the last set of rules it
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
was the
 
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
equestrians um so that's one that is
 
03:11:34.110 --> 03:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
that is the vehicle by which we would
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
try to come to grips with with the use
 
03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
of drones on state lands but in the
 
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
short term we're just very you know we
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
don't we we just don't think that drones
 
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
up at Canon are going to be good um you
 
03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
know we prohibit them there um even
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
though somebody wanted might want to you
 
03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
know it's a cool place beautiful
 
03:11:56.710 --> 03:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
location we we don't think that's
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and so we need to have
 
03:12:00.349 --> 03:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
something in place under our existing
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
rules and and made the decision not to
 
03:12:03.359 --> 03:12:08.429 align:start position:0%
rules and and made the decision not to
permit

03:12:08.429 --> 03:12:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
them I have representative Egan followed
 
03:12:13.309 --> 03:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
by representative harb is anyone else
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
who wants to get in
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
line no if not representative Egan thank
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you director Bryce
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh in previous
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
testimony there was a concern about
 
03:12:29.150 --> 03:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
being drone use being able to be used by
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
professionals that might need to do it
 
03:12:33.229 --> 03:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
for their work is there now a system of
 
03:12:35.830 --> 03:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
Permitting for professionals whether
 
03:12:38.910 --> 03:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
land surveyors commercial photographers
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
to process a permit to use a drone on
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
state lands and if there is a process
 
03:12:49.030 --> 03:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
can you explain how that gets executed
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
yes there is a process it's a special
 
03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
use permit for for non sort of
 
03:12:57.389 --> 03:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
non-traditional uses um we're trying to
 
03:12:59.790 --> 03:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
streamline that process it's sometimes
 
03:13:01.469 --> 03:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
it's hard for us to keep up with the
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
changes and expectations of our users on
 
03:13:06.309 --> 03:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
public lands we're very cognizant of
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
that um like we're working on permits
 
03:13:11.990 --> 03:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
for uh working with our permit person
 
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
when can you get the permit out for the
 
03:13:15.870 --> 03:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
ATV Festival in Berlin when can you get
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
the permit out for the seafood festival
 
03:13:20.150 --> 03:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
out in in Hampton so that's kind of the
 
03:13:22.190 --> 03:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
scale of what we're ISS we're dealing
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
with with the special use permit process
 
03:13:27.870 --> 03:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
but yes anyone can ask for a permit to
 
03:13:32.190 --> 03:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
to use a drone on on um on state land
 
03:13:37.110 --> 03:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
for commercial use or or or
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
not and is there a fee for that and is
 
03:13:44.590 --> 03:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
it the special use permit fee is
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
$10000 for example guides that are
 
03:13:49.590 --> 03:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
guiding uh that want permission to guide
 
03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
in developed recreational areas we issue
 
03:13:56.710 --> 03:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
a a permit for them for $100 to to be
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
able to do that um so and that's set in
 
03:14:03.389 --> 03:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
the fee package that's approved by the
 
03:14:06.550 --> 03:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee last followup so there
 
03:14:09.070 --> 03:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
is a system in place for anyone that a
 
03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
professional use that wanted to utilize
 
03:14:13.710 --> 03:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
a drone in their professional capacity
 
03:14:15.870 --> 03:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
to work with the park system and get it
 
03:14:18.510 --> 03:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
executed quickly and cost- effectively
 
03:14:20.229 --> 03:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
yes but I'd be remiss if I didn't say
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's not the smoothest most friendliest
 
03:14:26.110 --> 03:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
system but there is a system thank you
 
03:14:26.120 --> 03:14:28.510 align:start position:0%
system but there is a system thank you
very

03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
much representative harp thank you and
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you director Bryce for taking my
 
03:14:36.269 --> 03:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
question um I just wanted to clarify
 
03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
without this bill your department still
 
03:14:42.510 --> 03:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
has the ability to review your rules and
 
03:14:45.510 --> 03:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
regs and then to if you decide
 
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate what place what location
 
03:14:51.630 --> 03:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
what regulations you could set uh
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
regulations allowing drones when deemed
 
03:14:57.190 --> 03:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate under a revised rules is
 
03:15:03.630 --> 03:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
you any question representative
 
03:15:09.590 --> 03:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
post yes thank you for um allowing me to
 
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
speak um and thank you for being here
 
03:15:11.840 --> 03:15:13.670 align:start position:0%
speak um and thank you for being here
today

03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:15:19.750 --> 03:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
um would you say on average um how many
 
03:15:22.429 --> 03:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
requests you would get in a
 
03:15:25.750 --> 03:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
year for using it on the park system
 
03:15:28.990 --> 03:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
having drones used on a park
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
system I could not I don't know how many
 
03:15:35.309 --> 03:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
drones are are sold I think what and you
 
03:15:38.110 --> 03:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
hit a really really key issue in trying
 
03:15:43.189 --> 03:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
to manage public Recreation um which is
 
03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the the difference between when
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's like one or two people and it's
 
03:15:53.189 --> 03:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
like thousands of people and so um and
 
03:15:55.710 --> 03:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
that changes the overall impact of the
 
03:15:57.830 --> 03:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
activity for you know we hear that with
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
the uh ATVs which this committee has
 
03:16:03.870 --> 03:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
worked with for years that you know one
 
03:16:06.189 --> 03:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
ATV going by your house or two you're
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
not going to bother with but we get
 
03:16:09.790 --> 03:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
complaints that you know there's like
 
03:16:13.150 --> 03:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
200 apbs going by our house and so how
 
03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
do how do we address that so I think
 
03:16:17.710 --> 03:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of scale you know if it's
 
03:16:20.469 --> 03:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
if it's if you're going up to hike up
 
03:16:24.550 --> 03:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
karge and um uh you know and and there's
 
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of campgrounds do you
 
03:16:27.349 --> 03:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
allow them in campgrounds so if you're
 
03:16:29.349 --> 03:16:29.359 align:start position:0%
in a campground and one person has a a
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
small drone like he has and is just
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
flying it around their campsite for fun
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but if every Camp
 
03:16:39.910 --> 03:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
camper has one in a confined area and is
 
03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
is using them or on a trail everybody
 
03:16:45.269 --> 03:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
has a drone you know that just changes
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
the whole the whole um you know the
 
03:16:53.670 --> 03:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
whole uh issue of of impact so very good
 
03:16:56.910 --> 03:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
question follow up have you had
 
03:16:59.309 --> 03:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
conversations within the agency of
 
03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
making any kind of
 
03:17:04.590 --> 03:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
approvals um for use in different
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
areas we we we currently have a drone
 
03:17:11.630 --> 03:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
policy in play right now that we're
 
03:17:13.389 --> 03:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
working on uh
 
03:17:16.790 --> 03:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
finalizing um temporarily till we go to
 
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
to till we go to ruem and we're working
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
with um Patrick Hackley the director of
 
03:17:23.950 --> 03:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
forest lands on that because most of the
 
03:17:25.710 --> 03:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
acreage that would be affected would be
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
that uh Acres so we're currently working
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
on finalizing that and
 
03:17:35.910 --> 03:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
um uh and then we'll it'll need to be
 
03:17:37.150 --> 03:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
taken up and
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
Ru but right now as I said before
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
anybody can request a permit to fly a
 
03:17:44.550 --> 03:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
drone let's say if you're we have them
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
for re we you know do them for research
 
03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
do them for mostly it's either research
 
03:17:51.189 --> 03:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
or it's mostly for commercial uh
 
03:17:55.229 --> 03:17:55.239 align:start position:0%
photography or to support um support the
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
Tourism one more
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
follow um so as
 
03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
recreationally do you get many
 
03:18:12.870 --> 03:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
calls well as as the gentleman
 
03:18:15.870 --> 03:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh who Who provided great testimony
 
03:18:19.189 --> 03:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
earlier said um there's currently no
 
03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions on trones of State lands so
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
I I I'm sure there's a lot of people
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
that are using them and don't think that
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
it's a permit's required so that's the
 
03:18:30.110 --> 03:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
case where you know we don't have any
 
03:18:32.030 --> 03:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement capacity in
 
03:18:35.189 --> 03:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
Parks uh so until we get a complaint
 
03:18:37.070 --> 03:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
about something we're not going to
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
follow up so I don't have I don't have a
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
sense for how many people would ask or
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
how many many people are out there using
 
03:18:45.510 --> 03:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
drones unless it's in one of those
 
03:18:48.189 --> 03:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
places that is heavily used heavily
 
03:18:50.790 --> 03:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
managed like it they're they're they
 
03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
have a lot of issues with people trying
 
03:18:54.510 --> 03:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
to use drones at Cannon both in the
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
summer and the winter and in frankon and
 
03:18:58.110 --> 03:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
not State Park you know just picture
 
03:19:00.990 --> 03:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
walking on your Flume uh on the walkway
 
03:19:02.429 --> 03:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
and going up there and having a bunch of
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
Zone drones zipping by you taking
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
photographs which would be great it's a
 
03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
beautiful place to do that so there
 
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
there are some places where it really
 
03:19:12.269 --> 03:19:12.279 align:start position:0%
has a significant impact on your
 
03:19:14.830 --> 03:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
experience and we run in usually those
 
03:19:17.110 --> 03:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
places the ones that we run into the
 
03:19:18.590 --> 03:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
most likelihood that somebody's going to
 
03:19:20.269 --> 03:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
be trying to use a drone and in that
 
03:19:21.670 --> 03:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
case we're going to deny it you know
 
03:19:23.110 --> 03:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
during the you know we're not going to
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
let you fly drones during you know
 
03:19:28.309 --> 03:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
during the season uh up The Flume you
 
03:19:38.790 --> 03:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:42.650 --> 03:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
use thank you Mr than very much
 
03:19:42.660 --> 03:19:44.309 align:start position:0%

Aeronautics good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:20:07.110 --> 03:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee U my name
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
is uh Trisha Lambert and I'm the
 
03:20:09.950 --> 03:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Bureau of
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics um with the Department of
 
03:20:13.349 --> 03:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
trans ation and with me I have Jason
 
03:20:16.590 --> 03:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
levit who is our uas or drone planner
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
within the
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
department um for those who aren't
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
really familiar with who we are and what
 
03:20:24.030 --> 03:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
we do we are a small Bureau um however
 
03:20:26.910 --> 03:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
we um oversee all the
 
03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory um actions for all aircraft
 
03:20:33.389 --> 03:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
which now include um uas or
 
03:20:37.630 --> 03:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
drones um we're also um a Construction
 
03:20:40.990 --> 03:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
Group so we build infrastructure for
 
03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:42.550 align:start position:0%
Group so we build infrastructure for
Aviation

03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
Aviation
 
03:20:43.950 --> 03:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:20:46.110 --> 03:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess one of the big things that we
 
03:20:47.790 --> 03:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
do and I want to be really clear for us
 
03:20:49.710 --> 03:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
is that one of our biggest jobs is to
 
03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
promote Aviation and that includes
 
03:20:55.990 --> 03:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
everything from whether it's your um a
 
03:20:59.429 --> 03:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
glider man aircraft commercial aircraft
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
that everybody uses down to the uas uh
 
03:21:05.269 --> 03:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
drone um
 
03:21:07.750 --> 03:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
we um we're opposing this bill as
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
written um only because I think there's
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
issues within the bill as written um and
 
03:21:16.750 --> 03:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
some of them are technical some of them
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
I I think are um agency jur state agency
 
03:21:22.070 --> 03:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional I believe that there are
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
some issues with
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
um um trying the compliance aspect of it
 
03:21:30.630 --> 03:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
and the enforcement um we are the
 
03:21:34.349 --> 03:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency for Aviation um so we
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
we respond to aircraft accidents we
 
03:21:37.590 --> 03:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
respond to drone
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
accidents um and so we think there's
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
some cross agency issues with the bill
 
03:21:45.790 --> 03:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
as it says um and then um finally I
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
think there's some land jurisdiction
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
which I is not my hat but I will share
 
03:21:51.229 --> 03:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
it that's part of the Department of
 
03:21:53.790 --> 03:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation so uh as part of the bill
 
03:21:55.950 --> 03:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we had put into
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
last legislative session was that
 
03:22:00.229 --> 03:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually to define a uas this bill tries
 
03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
to yet Define it again and that creates
 
03:22:05.469 --> 03:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
a bad Patchwork of things of which makes
 
03:22:09.189 --> 03:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
it difficult for us to to regulate um it
 
03:22:12.389 --> 03:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
is in fact a federal registered
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle um which makes it very different
 
03:22:16.990 --> 03:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
than anything else in the state um which
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
is why it comes under specifically under
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
under the Department of Transportation
 
03:22:22.990 --> 03:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Aeronautics who is the liaison
 
03:22:24.990 --> 03:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
FAA the second issue
 
03:22:33.269 --> 03:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
um is
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh it mentions that the that dncr
 
03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner will have the approval
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
there are other um trails that are owned
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
by the Department of
 
03:22:48.309 --> 03:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh that we would need to
 
03:22:50.710 --> 03:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
have that uh AB the commissioner of the
 
03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation would need
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
to have that right to to make those
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
decisions um specifically relating to
 
03:22:58.710 --> 03:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
the to the rail trails that are still
 
03:23:00.830 --> 03:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
under the ownership and mainten uh
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
management of the
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
department and
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
finally the federal preemption piece is
 
03:23:10.429 --> 03:23:10.439 align:start position:0%
is I'll give you an example of the one
 
03:23:12.189 --> 03:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
is the Federal Aviation administ ation
 
03:23:15.229 --> 03:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
they mentioned that they have to add
 
03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
they want more information put on the
 
03:23:19.830 --> 03:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
Drone the federal the FAA uh registers
 
03:23:22.590 --> 03:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
about 800 has about 800,000 drones
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
registered it requires it has a federal
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
number um Federal registration number on
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
aircraft we call it an nend number um
 
03:23:31.630 --> 03:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
some drones can have an end number or
 
03:23:33.710 --> 03:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
they'll just have a regular number ass
 
03:23:36.189 --> 03:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
assigned to that um I believe the
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
individual is that correct to the
 
03:23:41.150 --> 03:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
individual who owns them that is on the
 
03:23:43.710 --> 03:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
aircraft when you start trying to put
 
03:23:45.469 --> 03:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
other information in there so that they
 
03:23:48.790 --> 03:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
can track it to try to figure out who
 
03:23:49.950 --> 03:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
owns the
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
Drone um that would be Federal
 
03:23:53.950 --> 03:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
preemption because now the Drone
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
operator does not have to do that um the
 
03:23:59.229 --> 03:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
second part is is I'm not quite sure how
 
03:24:01.389 --> 03:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to enforce it because
 
03:24:03.990 --> 03:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
young children as young as 13 own these
 
03:24:07.710 --> 03:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
drones and so you're not going to be
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
able to track back to the FAA to get
 
03:24:12.670 --> 03:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
that information because they're minor
 
03:24:14.710 --> 03:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
so you can see it creates this
 
03:24:19.070 --> 03:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue um which even we as a
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
we can probably get it as Lea is on the
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
FAA but the minor become an issue I'm
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
not sure they would give that to us so I
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
see an Enforcement issue as it relates
 
03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
to it
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm G to keep it really
 
03:24:33.469 --> 03:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
simple with that we're happy to take
 
03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions we're happy to work with
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
anybody it is clear that anybody who
 
03:24:40.830 --> 03:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
owns property has the right to um make
 
03:24:42.990 --> 03:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
the decision whether you can launch or
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
land a drone at that property whether
 
03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's your private property or whether
 
03:24:50.830 --> 03:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's State Property um but overflights
 
03:24:52.030 --> 03:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
and I know that was mentioned I don't
 
03:24:54.389 --> 03:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
like to repeat but overflights you
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
cannot restrict it's under the
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the of the federal
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
government under the FAA so with that
 
03:25:03.150 --> 03:25:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer questions um
 
03:25:06.990 --> 03:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:10.469 --> 03:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
is any questions from members of the
 
03:25:10.479 --> 03:25:14.750 align:start position:0%
is any questions from members of the
committee

03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.710 --> 03:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
minute thank thank you Mr chair members
 
03:25:33.550 --> 03:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Rob
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
Johnson representing the New Hamshire
 
03:25:36.750 --> 03:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau as the federation's policy
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
director and newshire farm consists of
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
just under 2,000 Family Farm memberships
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
and then another 1,000 supporting
 
03:25:48.189 --> 03:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
members we are opposed to the bill as
 
03:25:50.670 --> 03:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
drafted representativ uh Smith touched
 
03:25:52.990 --> 03:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
on it with an earlier question as and
 
03:25:55.150 --> 03:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
the director did mention it and he did
 
03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
not say the the amount bit I've heard in
 
03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
the past my understanding is that the
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide trail system it's something
 
03:26:04.910 --> 03:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
like 75 to 80% of that trail system is
 
03:26:07.229 --> 03:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
on private property much of it running
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
through our members property and much of
 
03:26:12.750 --> 03:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
it is snow wheel trails and as a as a
 
03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
private land owner my family has has uh
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
land uh uh Trails on our our property uh
 
03:26:21.189 --> 03:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
that that we are uh we want to support
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
we want to support the Public's use um I
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the intent of this bill
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
but if it were to pass as is to allow
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
for drones over the Statewide trail
 
03:26:31.830 --> 03:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
system you would not have a Statewide
 
03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:32.670 align:start position:0%
system you would not have a Statewide
trail

03:26:32.670 --> 03:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
trail
 
03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
system and I I'll leave it at that Mr
 
03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank
 
03:26:39.269 --> 03:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much any questions by
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
members of the

03:26:52.510 --> 03:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
much and Jason

stock from the New Hampshire Timberland
 
03:26:54.880 --> 03:26:58.510 align:start position:0%

03:26:58.510 --> 03:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
Association good afternoon uh for the
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
record Jason stock executive director of
 
03:27:04.229 --> 03:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
03:27:07.150 --> 03:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
Association and I will be very brief
 
03:27:10.110 --> 03:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
basically what Rob said we are in the
 
03:27:12.429 --> 03:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
same place these Trails the Statewide
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
trail system crosses our our members
 
03:27:19.030 --> 03:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
property and when those Trails when that
 
03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
land owner agreed to allow the trail
 
03:27:23.670 --> 03:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
across their property I am quite certain
 
03:27:25.229 --> 03:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
drones were never
 
03:27:28.110 --> 03:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
contemplated and for that reason you
 
03:27:30.870 --> 03:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
know our our members it was a specific
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
use that was granted um there's always a
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
privacy concern someone launches a drone
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
near my buildings or near my my resid
 
03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
pres you know I'm not not going to be
 
03:27:46.469 --> 03:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
real I may not be real comfortable about
 
03:27:48.910 --> 03:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
that so for that reason I'm coming today
 
03:27:51.630 --> 03:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
to oppose the bill as drafted would be
 
03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
happy to continue to participate in any
 
03:27:56.990 --> 03:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
further discussions thank
 
03:28:00.110 --> 03:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative post uh
 
03:28:00.120 --> 03:28:01.710 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative post uh
representative

03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:28:04.030 --> 03:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you very much for taking my
 
03:28:09.070 --> 03:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
question and um uh your members or the
 
03:28:11.349 --> 03:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
people that you're representing um
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
assuming with the property they have
 
03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
they they have current use right correct
 
03:28:19.550 --> 03:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
um so in and and I don't know any of
 
03:28:22.590 --> 03:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
this but um in most occasions there are
 
03:28:25.269 --> 03:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
different levels of
 
03:28:28.950 --> 03:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
use um for current uses for
 
03:28:31.710 --> 03:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
recreationally hunting things like that
 
03:28:35.309 --> 03:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
you can prohibit or you can allow uh has
 
03:28:38.030 --> 03:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
there been any discussion about allowing
 
03:28:39.870 --> 03:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
is this been a
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
conversation um
 
03:28:43.229 --> 03:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
about allowing
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
drones as part of a current
 
03:28:49.910 --> 03:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
use system because if you have current
 
03:28:53.590 --> 03:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
use and you deny deny a recreation or
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
something like that that can be removed
 
03:28:57.870 --> 03:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
as current
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
use so I just wondered if that was you
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
know something people had discussed
 
03:29:07.870 --> 03:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
because this is part of the future and
 
03:29:09.790 --> 03:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
there are so many people that do have
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
this sure sure so first off in in
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
current use is a another ball of wax but
 
03:29:22.510 --> 03:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's a tax it's a a means of assessing
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
taxes um on property based on the use in
 
03:29:28.830 --> 03:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our current use program
 
03:29:31.630 --> 03:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
you have current use that assesses taxes
 
03:29:33.990 --> 03:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
based on whether you're growing trees or
 
03:29:36.750 --> 03:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
growing an agricultural crop and that
 
03:29:38.550 --> 03:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
assessment is based on that land's
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
productive capability to produce cords
 
03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
of wood bushels of corn Etc in New
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a way to kind of create an
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
incentive to for land owners to keep
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
their land open for outdoor recreation
 
03:29:57.189 --> 03:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
there is an incentive in built into the
 
03:29:59.349 --> 03:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
program it's called the recreational
 
03:30:02.830 --> 03:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
discount that your assessment you can
 
03:30:05.309 --> 03:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
say agree that yes I will allow
 
03:30:08.670 --> 03:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
pedestrian access and it's pedestrian
 
03:30:12.189 --> 03:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
access um I will allow that and I can
 
03:30:16.870 --> 03:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
and by making that notice and filing
 
03:30:18.910 --> 03:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
with the town that you're allowing this
 
03:30:20.710 --> 03:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
you can receive an additional I believe
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's 10% of a reduction on your assessed
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
assessment not tax bill but the assessed
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
value of it um so land um if you have
 
03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
land and you do not want people on it
 
03:30:37.469 --> 03:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
you can still enroll it in current use
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
and post it current use is not a public
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
access um program it's just simply a tax
 
03:30:46.910 --> 03:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
assessment program and it's really to
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
promote maintaining working Farms
 
03:30:49.840 --> 03:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
promote maintaining working Farms
working

03:30:50.950 --> 03:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
working
 
03:30:54.670 --> 03:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
Forest so drone use with even within the
 
03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
context of current use has I am not
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
aware of any discussions about drone use
 
03:31:03.790 --> 03:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
current use or any connection
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
there thank you you're welcome
 
03:31:10.229 --> 03:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
representative kraton for a question
 
03:31:13.349 --> 03:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you sir can you explain the
 
03:31:16.269 --> 03:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony that that I understand so
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
far has said that the the issue is take
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
off and Landing the flying of the
 
03:31:25.630 --> 03:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
Drone can be over anything private
 
03:31:28.469 --> 03:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
property or anything um to similar to an
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
airplane airplane I'm a I'm a Private
 
03:31:33.269 --> 03:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
Pilot I can fly as long as I'm over 500
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
feet so how does that impact on your on
 
03:31:40.349 --> 03:31:40.359 align:start position:0%
your discussion if it's currently
 
03:31:43.309 --> 03:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to fly over land anyway I
 
03:31:45.469 --> 03:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
believe that's what the testimony said
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about taking off
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
from those lands what we're what we're
 
03:31:52.910 --> 03:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
what you've said is you can't take off
 
03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
okay but you can fly over under current
 
03:31:58.710 --> 03:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
law as I understand it yeah and great
 
03:32:01.389 --> 03:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
question and so if I
 
03:32:04.590 --> 03:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
have 50,000 acres and I have a trail
 
03:32:09.349 --> 03:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
that cuts across it um what I heard I
 
03:32:11.070 --> 03:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
heard exactly what you heard is I can
 
03:32:12.990 --> 03:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
fly a drone the same as I could fly an
 
03:32:15.790 --> 03:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
airplane or a helicopter over that
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
property um our issue though and we all
 
03:32:21.189 --> 03:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
get that our issue is if I have that
 
03:32:23.790 --> 03:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
trail across that property and now folks
 
03:32:26.229 --> 03:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
are which is on my property and they're
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
using that as a a launching and landing
 
03:32:32.469 --> 03:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
pad to go and fly over and and look at
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
my property maybe scope out a Timber
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
sale or whatever that's going on in my
 
03:32:40.349 --> 03:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
property that's where we we start to get
 
03:32:43.070 --> 03:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
a little longer uncomfortable I people
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
do video or aerial surveillance all the
 
03:32:48.269 --> 03:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
time of the state we get that and that's
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
the world we live in but drones when I
 
03:32:55.110 --> 03:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
talk to my my policy committee drones
 
03:32:56.269 --> 03:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
there's a feeling that it's a little
 
03:33:00.269 --> 03:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
more invasive it's a little more intense
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
um the type of scrutiny that can be done
 
03:33:04.830 --> 03:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
with a drone versus a plane that's
 
03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:15.030 align:start position:0%

members of the resources and Rec

committee I'm excited to be here today
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
to introduce HB 1451 FN relative to the
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
recovery of submerged
 
04:05:45.790 --> 04:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
logs uh this bill originated in October
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
of 2020 as a constituent request um and
 
04:05:52.630 --> 04:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
thankfully the constituent is here um
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
because they know more a lot they know a
 
04:05:57.710 --> 04:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
lot more about the issue than I do
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
um everybody on the committee should
 
04:06:02.349 --> 04:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
have received the letter from the
 
04:06:03.790 --> 04:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
04:06:07.469 --> 04:06:07.479 align:start position:0%
last night um that outlined some pretty
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
critical structural issues in the bill
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
um I am happy to acknowledge that um as
 
04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
this is not especially my area of
 
04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
expertise um I made some drafting
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
mistakes uh in conflicting
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
rsas um
 
04:06:30.229 --> 04:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
and uh I I acknowledge that what I think
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
my hope here today is um not to have the
 
04:06:37.070 --> 04:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee OTP the bill or not to have
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
the committee it El the bill um as
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
written uh the constituent today um is
 
04:06:49.469 --> 04:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
here to provide very what I thought uh
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
were substantive uh examples of what
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplished with this
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh create uh sort of a
 
04:07:00.269 --> 04:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
demonstration of why something in this
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
realm is needed um and what I would hope
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
for is that we can either in from study
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
the bill move it to a study committee or
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
um make a very simple Amendment because
 
04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
what I think I did in drafting this was
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
significantly over complicate the issue
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh and there will be a couple folks that
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
follow me that explain that um and I'm
 
04:07:27.790 --> 04:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
happy to work with anybody on the
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
committee um to fix that um because I
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
think uh as you'll see there is some
 
04:07:39.910 --> 04:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
substantive need um in my opinion for
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
something to come out of this so that's
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
all I have um I can take any questions
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the best of my ability um but I would
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
definitely refer any questions on
 
04:07:54.269 --> 04:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
substance to the following presenter um
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
because like I said they know
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
considerably more about this issue than
 
04:07:57.319 --> 04:07:59.630 align:start position:0%
considerably more about this issue than
I

04:07:59.630 --> 04:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
do thank you the presenter would be uh
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%

packets to pass around to folks um so I
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
would ask that we could distribute those
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
really quick just so everybody has
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%

actually hear me
 
04:09:39.750 --> 04:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
out the actual legislation of having to
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
do with submerge logs is way out of my
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
pay grade so what I was really just
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
focusing on is pointing out that there
 
04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
is a valuable resource on the bottom of
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
the lakes ponds and rivers in New
 
04:09:54.269 --> 04:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the packet that I have uh
 
04:09:55.950 --> 04:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
for you just is a brief introductory
 
04:09:59.109 --> 04:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
letter on the front the second
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
page and the third page are actual log
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
reserves one in Lake wyan and
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the other up on the anders scogin in
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
Berlin these are pretty um different
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
examples uh so I've been I've been a
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
scuba diver for 25 years U most of my
 
04:10:21.870 --> 04:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
life and had an awful of opportunities
 
04:10:24.389 --> 04:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
to see examples like this where there
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
are deposited logs in rivers and lakes
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
the walki WAN example um sorry for the
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
terrible pictures but they are probably
 
04:10:35.469 --> 04:10:35.479 align:start position:0%
about 30 to 40 white oak logs just
 
04:10:37.630 --> 04:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
sitting on the bottom of the lake they
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
were put there intentionally I believe
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
they were all actually saw logs and
 
04:10:43.630 --> 04:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
they're all in fabulous condition I
 
04:10:45.109 --> 04:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
don't know when they were put there I
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:10:50.309 --> 04:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
why um but to harvest those would be as
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
simple as just getting a float bag and
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
actually floating them over to the
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
launch ramp which is about 100 yards
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
away so no actual machine would be
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
required for that the next picture up on
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
the anders scoggan you have a bunch of
 
04:11:05.630 --> 04:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
logs that are actually embedded into the
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
into the river bank quite a different
 
04:11:10.030 --> 04:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
situation and it would be a lot more
 
04:11:13.070 --> 04:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
disruptive to the structure of the River
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
Bank than say the example of the logs on
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of Lake Walk wyan could just
 
04:11:17.760 --> 04:11:18.510 align:start position:0%
the bottom of Lake Walk wyan could just
be

04:11:18.510 --> 04:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:11:21.389 --> 04:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
plucked so back in 1938 I'm sure you
 
04:11:23.149 --> 04:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
guys are all aware of the hurricane that
 
04:11:24.510 --> 04:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
came through was really quite
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
destructive New Hampshire didn't receive
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
as much of the um of the destructive
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
force of that hurricane as Vermont for
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
example but we did receive some uh to
 
04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
the point where the department of
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
agriculture I think it
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
was actually created the northeastern
 
04:11:44.349 --> 04:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
Timber Salvage Administration for the
 
04:11:46.590 --> 04:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
sole purpose of getting the logs off of
 
04:11:49.469 --> 04:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
the forest floor for two reasons one to
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
prevent all that fuel build up in case
 
04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
of forest fire and second to actually
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
get a valuable res resource off off the
 
04:11:58.910 --> 04:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
ground um they weren't able to do it
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
fast enough so what they ended up doing
 
04:12:01.469 --> 04:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
was actually ditching a lot of those
 
04:12:04.149 --> 04:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
logs into rivers and lakes well mostly
 
04:12:06.510 --> 04:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
ponds and lakes so at some point we
 
04:12:08.870 --> 04:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
could go back and actually get that
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
resource so it's obviously something
 
04:12:13.109 --> 04:12:13.119 align:start position:0%
that's worthwhile and I I just think
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
that it's it would be a shame for there
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
not to be an Avenue for the general
 
04:12:20.590 --> 04:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
public to be part of that
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
recovery um as it as it is right now all
 
04:12:24.590 --> 04:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
those logs are sitting there and they're
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
the property of the state with no
 
04:12:30.109 --> 04:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
realistic um way for the general public
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
to access those there is a law that or
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
an exemption rather the next page I
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:38.109 align:start position:0%
an exemption rather the next page I
believe

04:12:38.109 --> 04:12:38.119 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:12:40.109 --> 04:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
the exemption for the grant and right of
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
submerged logs for municipalities and
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
that is basically allowed in cases where
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's a navigational Hazard or there's
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
some other problem that these logs are
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
creating there is one part in there that
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
says a municipality that receives a
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
permit under this section may enter into
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
a commercially reasonable private
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
contract to undertake log removal after
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
publicly requesting bids for such work
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
for your average citizen that that seems
 
04:13:08.830 --> 04:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
like an awfully tedious process and my
 
04:13:10.750 --> 04:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
day-to-day job is actually permitting
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Environmental
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
Services so I I understand first
 
04:13:16.550 --> 04:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
firsthand how difficult sometimes it can
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
be so I guess my only my only request is
 
04:13:21.710 --> 04:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
that you consider the fact that this is
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
a valuable resource and it's a historic
 
04:13:28.790 --> 04:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
resource that um that should not go to
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
questions anyone on the committee have a
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:13:41.189 --> 04:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
post thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
04:13:42.429 --> 04:13:42.439 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
today um so one of my questions is um by
 
04:13:49.710 --> 04:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
removing them they've been there so long
 
04:13:52.269 --> 04:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
they're now part of the Lakes I'm
 
04:13:55.710 --> 04:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
talking I guess about the um Lake wacaan
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
in Meredith they've been there so long
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's uh habitats going on
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
and fishes and all sorts of things so
 
04:14:07.149 --> 04:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
you would think except those part
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
particular logs um there isn't actually
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of structure the logs are piled on
 
04:14:15.149 --> 04:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
one another so there are some areas that
 
04:14:16.710 --> 04:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
you would be able to hide if you were a
 
04:14:18.429 --> 04:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
fish but they're all really really
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
exposed so if you were to imagine a pine
 
04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
tree falling upside down into the into
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
the water you're going to have more of
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
like a curtain and it's going to be a
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
lot better habitat so that's why a lot
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
of folks when they're going fishing
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
they're looking for those Fallen trees
 
04:14:33.389 --> 04:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
these are these are just logs there are
 
04:14:35.790 --> 04:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
no branches there's really nothing there
 
04:14:37.229 --> 04:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
that provides any kind of signific ific
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
an habitat but that's not to say that
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
some of those reserves aren't providing
 
04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
habitat so that's why the perverting
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
process I think would be would be
 
04:14:48.109 --> 04:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
important I'm not saying that we should
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
just be you know everything should be
 
04:14:52.149 --> 04:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
fair game to whomever that's why I
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
included the the picture of the Andre
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
scogan Reserve because that would be a
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
lot more impacting for Habitat whereas
 
04:15:01.070 --> 04:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
the logs on walki Wan are just sitting
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
really follow and so can you tell me how
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
deep these are those are in about 25 to
 
04:15:13.910 --> 04:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
30 feet of water you can almost on a
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
clear day with a sun right overhead you
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.630 --> 04:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
them any other questions members of the
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee I have a few don't go away
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
um these these logs right now are the
 
04:15:36.510 --> 04:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
property of the state of New hampire as
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
far as I understand yeah what
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh are if you're if if they're if you
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
how how are you looking
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
to uh you looking to have them wave the
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
right of ownership or uh because I
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
presume you're you're not collecting
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
these logs so that uh you can move them
 
04:16:02.189 --> 04:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
to somewhere else you're collecting them
 
04:16:03.309 --> 04:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
to sell
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
them uh so what would be what would what
 
04:16:08.950 --> 04:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
are you view what are you looking at as
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
process that that might be above my
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
level of expertise but what I would
 
04:16:18.910 --> 04:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
Envision is is actually modeling after
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
the state of Michigan they have a
 
04:16:23.149 --> 04:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
similar program so it's it's based on a
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
fee structure I think wouldn't differ
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
much than you know the mineral rights
 
04:16:30.349 --> 04:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
for for for Excavating in you know in
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
rivers for gold um it's I don't and
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
actually Dees may may be able to speak
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
to that a little bit better than I can
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
but I I imagine a permitting process
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
that would there would be a flat
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
rate um fee if say for example I wanted
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
to Harbor those logs for myself not for
 
04:16:50.670 --> 04:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
sale but then there would be an
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
additional rate based on any kind of
 
04:16:55.109 --> 04:16:55.119 align:start position:0%
commercial gain if they were
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
sold um but as far as the transfer and
 
04:16:59.229 --> 04:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
ownership that's I can't really speak to
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
enough well what I what I meant was
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
since they
 
04:17:10.349 --> 04:17:10.359 align:start position:0%
they are owned by the state you would be
 
04:17:12.109 --> 04:17:12.119 align:start position:0%
you would be would be they are state
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
property now and then but you would be
 
04:17:19.469 --> 04:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
getting possession of them and
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
converting that so
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
just that's that's what I was what I was
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
so certainly something to consider yeah
 
04:17:28.830 --> 04:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh I have
 
04:17:31.469 --> 04:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
seen uh
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
on I'm so I don't know if was Discovery
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
or one of the other channels they did
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
something something I think it was on
 
04:17:41.670 --> 04:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
Michigan and some of the logs that they
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
were taking out were you couldn't get
 
04:17:48.630 --> 04:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
them now I mean I'm talking about Bird's
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
Eye Maple and stuff like that uh so
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
there's significant value to these so
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
would uh would would you look to have
 
04:18:05.070 --> 04:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
create to have a uh some kind
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
of uh fee fee schedule on the on the
 
04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
quality or this the value of the log
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
specifically I think that's a
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
that's difficult only because every time
 
04:18:20.189 --> 04:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
you were to harvest anything then you
 
04:18:21.870 --> 04:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
would have to bring in an
 
04:18:24.750 --> 04:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
appraiser and who I don't really know
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
what the scale is for assessing the
 
04:18:31.389 --> 04:18:31.399 align:start position:0%
value of submerged logs um I mean I
 
04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
think in the legislation as was
 
04:18:35.149 --> 04:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
introduced uh there were supposed to be
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
an an appraiser at the Mill when there
 
04:18:38.670 --> 04:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
when the Timbers are actually being
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
milled I just don't see that being
 
04:18:44.830 --> 04:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
very um for lack of better words it
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
seems kind of complicated to me um so
 
04:18:49.950 --> 04:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I thought a flat rate for any
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
any removal and then in addition if
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
there were commercial sales then it
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be a percentage of that I think
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
the state of Michigan has a
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
5% uh sales tax for if you
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
will um something within reason so it's
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
not going to be prohibitive to actually
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
taking the logs out of the water in the
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
any questions by any members of the
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
committee if
 
04:19:18.830 --> 04:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
not thank you very much thank you folks
 
04:19:32.189 --> 04:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%

department hi good
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I put a letter on
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
everyone's area hopefully I printed out
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
20 and I have an extra one so I must
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
have missed someone so I'll just set
 
04:20:05.070 --> 04:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
that aside and I
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
apologize so good good afternoon
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
chairman Renzo and members of the House
 
04:20:12.630 --> 04:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
resources Recreation and development
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee I want to start by thanking
 
04:20:17.109 --> 04:20:17.119 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak and
 
04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
testify regarding House Bill 1451 FN
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
regarding the some the sorry acquisition
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
of submerged logs my name is Diane
 
04:20:31.070 --> 04:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
Timmons I'm recently in a new position
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire fishing game um I'm the
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries division Chief as of
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
June so this is a new process for me so
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
bear with
 
04:20:42.590 --> 04:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
me the New Hampshire fishing Game
 
04:20:44.790 --> 04:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
Commission voted yesterday unanimously
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill and we are in
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill for the
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
environmental and resources uh detriment
 
04:20:55.870 --> 04:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
that we think in expanding this
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity would
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
entail so first of all it's a little bit
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
redundant as the other gentlemen had
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned there is some um existing
 
04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
statutes in place by the Department of
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services that allows the
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
acquisition of submerged logs um under
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
various um conditions the one I'm in
 
04:21:22.990 --> 04:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
referencing is 482 A3 and also
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
482 a22
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
a so we take the Critter Approach at New
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game and there's a lot
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
of um un unintended con consequences
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
that result from this the biggest thing
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
being in Fisheries that any detriment to
 
04:21:47.469 --> 04:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
Habitat and wood is a huge component of
 
04:21:51.309 --> 04:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
habitat for warm water cold water fish
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:57.670 --> 04:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
organisms and also water quality is
 
04:22:00.030 --> 04:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
impacted when you start digging around
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
in these rivers and streams the other
 
04:22:05.149 --> 04:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
thing is wood although it may look like
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
a simple pile it is
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely driving what that system
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
looks like in a in a river as flow comes
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
down if there's a bunch of logs that
 
04:22:18.070 --> 04:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
water is forced around it causing an
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
Eddy approach so you get pools created
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
you get spawning gravel that gets
 
04:22:25.389 --> 04:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
cleaned out through that type of event
 
04:22:29.309 --> 04:22:29.319 align:start position:0%
so it's not just a pile of logs it's
 
04:22:34.349 --> 04:22:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
material what is vitalizing I mentioned
 
04:22:39.990 --> 04:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
it also supports spawning um we have
 
04:22:42.030 --> 04:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
been documenting a lot of wild
 
04:22:44.349 --> 04:22:44.359 align:start position:0%
reproduction of brook trout and I can
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
tell you being originally from the
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
northern region region one in Lancaster
 
04:22:50.870 --> 04:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
I've done a lot of work with wild brook
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
trout and river in rivers and streams
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
and all of my natural spawning sites not
 
04:22:59.710 --> 04:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
one of them exists without some sort of
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
wood structure it's really really
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
important to helping clean that gravel
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
that those fish need for spawning and
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's not just wild brook trout it's
 
04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
small minnos algae all sorts of bacteria
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
different things that are growing in
 
04:23:16.510 --> 04:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
that water that you just don't
 
04:23:19.710 --> 04:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
see so it also provides shelter as the
 
04:23:21.389 --> 04:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
gentleman had mentioned there's all
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
sorts of little fishes hiding in that
 
04:23:25.550 --> 04:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
area and they're doing that so the big
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
guys don't eat them so really really
 
04:23:30.630 --> 04:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
important for different production of um
 
04:23:30.640 --> 04:23:32.349 align:start position:0%
important for different production of um
alternate

04:23:32.349 --> 04:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
alternate
 
04:23:35.469 --> 04:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
species it of course provides food bugs
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
love wood algae loves wood all of those
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
are basis of sorry the basis of the food
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
chain so without that structure you
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that bottom layer of
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
forage so manipulating the sediment can
 
04:23:54.830 --> 04:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
also release bacteria including
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria causing algae and
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
bacterial blooms so
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria provide poses as a health
 
04:24:04.429 --> 04:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
risk for humans and pets as I'm sure
 
04:24:07.030 --> 04:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
everybody is fully aware of and it also
 
04:24:10.590 --> 04:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
causes various um issues with organisms
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
for example fish
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
kills so we would like to keep the
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
habitat as the habitat the way it stays
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
and the way it's been existing for
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
years and again I know it exists on um
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
various levels at this point but
 
04:24:28.670 --> 04:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
expanding it to the general public I
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
think would be really
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous so reductions in gamefish also
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
impact the economy so in the 2021
 
04:24:41.149 --> 04:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
American sport fish Association economic
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
impact study it revealed that $ 209
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
million was spent by New Hampshire
 
04:24:49.710 --> 04:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
anglers in 2019 yielding
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
$338 million to New Hampshire's economy
 
04:24:55.630 --> 04:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
so really really important you got to
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
start at the bottom with the habitat to
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
be able to produce the big fish that
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
amount to money on the other
 
04:25:05.309 --> 04:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
end so New Hampshire has also spent
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
fishing game as also spent sorry new
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
hire fishing game has also spent 20
 
04:25:11.790 --> 04:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
years restoring wood to streams and
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
lakes in the past for decades they
 
04:25:16.510 --> 04:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
removed wood we had all sorts of
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
problems with flooding uh instability of
 
04:25:22.389 --> 04:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
stream Banks issues with um Banks
 
04:25:24.990 --> 04:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
laughing off and causing problems and
 
04:25:27.550 --> 04:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
reducing spawning and all sorts of um
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
geomorphology so the structure of the
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
river so re making all the habitat
 
04:25:34.510 --> 04:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
homogeneous meaning you took away pools
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
everything filled in with the dirt that
 
04:25:38.309 --> 04:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's sloft off from the banks huge
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
problem so for years we have been
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
spending money on research and um
 
04:25:46.710 --> 04:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
garnering partners with various State
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
and non-governmental organizations as
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
well as the federal government and have
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
proven and realized that um wood is
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
really really critical to multiple
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
organis multiple organisms at various
 
04:26:01.119 --> 04:26:01.910 align:start position:0%
organis multiple organisms at various
life

04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
stages so the Fisheries habitat account
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
fund Within New Hampshire fishing game
 
04:26:08.830 --> 04:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
we've spent over
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
$73,000 just with instream wood
 
04:26:15.870 --> 04:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
projects so in closing I would like to
 
04:26:18.510 --> 04:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank chairman ranula as well as the
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for giving me
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak on behalf of
 
04:26:24.990 --> 04:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
the department fish and game department
 
04:26:27.109 --> 04:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
and allowing me to testify today in
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 1451 FN and we
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
hope that you do not allow the increased
 
04:26:36.670 --> 04:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
removal of submerged locks and with that
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
if anybody has any
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
questions any members of the committee
 
04:26:43.910 --> 04:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
have any
 
04:26:51.870 --> 04:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions uh the logs that seem to be uh
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
alluded to in this bill are cut
 
04:27:01.389 --> 04:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
logs and um so what is the difference
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
between cut logs in a in water versus uh
 
04:27:08.550 --> 04:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
trees that fall in and I presume are the
 
04:27:11.469 --> 04:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
ones that the Fisheries put in or
 
04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
whoever does that are they just falling
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
into the water like naturally so to
 
04:27:18.990 --> 04:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
speak or do they cut logs and put them
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
in so we do both we have some sorry if
 
04:27:25.189 --> 04:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
this is echoing we have some that we do
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
cut and we have some that we actually
 
04:27:29.389 --> 04:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
cut and let fall in so you get the whole
 
04:27:33.550 --> 04:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
canopy cover the cut logs there's a um
 
04:27:36.309 --> 04:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
so just to give an example it's it's a
 
04:27:38.910 --> 04:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
04:27:41.469 --> 04:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit of a perspective
 
04:27:43.710 --> 04:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
thing so cut logs even though it looks
 
04:27:46.429 --> 04:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
like just a simple cut log um for
 
04:27:48.389 --> 04:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
example the North country is full of cut
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
logs in the dead Diamond River the
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River the anders Skagen
 
04:27:54.309 --> 04:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
River all of those areas that were very
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
heavily logged in the forestry industry
 
04:27:59.710 --> 04:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
and still today there's all sorts of old
 
04:28:02.269 --> 04:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
cut logs in there from jams that
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
happened in the past that were dynamited
 
04:28:08.229 --> 04:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
or broken apart and those logs that even
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
though they're just cut logs they
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
provide structure they provide cover
 
04:28:15.870 --> 04:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
they increase um they all build up and
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
build what we wood GMS which is a huge
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
huge habitat thing all sorts of
 
04:28:23.870 --> 04:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
creatures live in those including otter
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
and mink and all sorts of other bigger
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
larger um terrestrial as well as aquatic
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
animals um so it's different so fish
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
juveniles you know utilize both canopy
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
and the the cut logs log jams are
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
obviously a buildup of both and then the
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
cut logs can just create jams on the
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
side or again the structure of the
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
riverbed itself with the geomorphology
 
04:28:50.830 --> 04:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
happening under various flow conditions
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
so both are very important we do both
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
we've CA we've cabled logs cut logs to
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
stones and boulders to be able to create
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
certain types of habitat that we trying
 
04:29:04.469 --> 04:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
to you know aose or create a waterfall
 
04:29:06.109 --> 04:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
or something like that so we've done
 
04:29:09.109 --> 04:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
both both are very beneficial W period
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
no matter what no matter what form it's
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
Habitat thank you for your testimony
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
ma'am so and according to the letter
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
that you sent out you said and you just
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there's uh two rsas that
 
04:29:36.269 --> 04:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
would allow harvesting of
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
cut logs what is that process is that a
 
04:29:41.070 --> 04:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable process that someone would go
 
04:29:42.309 --> 04:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
through if they wanted to harvest these
 
04:29:45.149 --> 04:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
logs um I will tell you that like him
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to pull the dees
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
non I should say the non Dees card and
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
the only reason I know about those is
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
because I did call the and speak with
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
them specifically about this and it's an
 
04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
R I don't know exactly I believe it's
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
under their Dr dredge and fill permit
 
04:30:04.830 --> 04:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
requirement and it allows municipalities
 
04:30:08.189 --> 04:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to withdraw wood from um from
 
04:30:12.189 --> 04:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
aquatic areas so but not businessman or
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
something of that nature not that I've
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
seen so we do have someone from Dees who
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
will be coming right after I'm like that
 
04:30:23.469 --> 04:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.910 --> 04:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions
 
04:30:33.389 --> 04:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.510 --> 04:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
testifying seeing none thank you very
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:30:37.880 --> 04:30:39.990 align:start position:0%
much thank
you

04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%

she
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
yeah you were you Wen you were you were
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
not here for the
 
04:31:18.109 --> 04:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
morning we had where we talked about
 
04:31:20.590 --> 04:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
changing the de's
 
04:31:25.710 --> 04:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
options the floor is
 
04:31:31.750 --> 04:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
yours thank you um chairman Mulo my name
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
is Darlene Forest I'm the administrator
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
of the wetlands Bureau at the New
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
Services we did email testimony to the
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
chair and to the committee
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
members in advance so you should have a
 
04:31:45.349 --> 04:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
copy we are routing hard copies I
 
04:31:47.910 --> 04:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
apologize I showed up with 20 but I gave
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
a couple to some folks in the audience
 
04:31:52.109 --> 04:31:52.119 align:start position:0%
that that were curious what our position
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be so there's only 18 coming
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
around but I only counted 17 persons so
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
we should still have you
 
04:31:59.790 --> 04:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
covered as a rather lengthy letter of
 
04:32:01.870 --> 04:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm not going to regurgitate
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
the whole thing uh some flaws in the
 
04:32:05.710 --> 04:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
legislation have already been mentioned
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
by the previous individuals
 
04:32:10.229 --> 04:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
testifying there are processes to cover
 
04:32:13.590 --> 04:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
this in Wetland statute now through the
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
standard Wetlands dredge and fill which
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
states anyone who needs to remove or
 
04:32:19.870 --> 04:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
wishes to dredge materials from public
 
04:32:23.309 --> 04:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
Waters needs a wetland permit that is
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
also qualifying those folks under the
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
Army cores programmatic General permit
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
for removal of things from public Waters
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
in addition to that it is mentioned as a
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
as a Project Specific criteria to go
 
04:32:37.229 --> 04:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
through through the GNC process for logs
 
04:32:38.590 --> 04:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
that are in lakes and ponds over 10
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
acres in size under RSA
 
04:32:44.030 --> 04:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
42 a
 
04:32:44.040 --> 04:32:45.590 align:start position:0%
42 a
22-a

04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
22-a
 
04:32:48.750 --> 04:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
so that process if this legislation were
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
to pass would still exist so in fact if
 
04:32:55.630 --> 04:32:55.640 align:start position:0%
an individual wanted to go through this
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
new process which is in Mr deer who is
 
04:32:59.269 --> 04:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
the Mr deer is the administrator of
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
watershed this legislation would create
 
04:33:03.870 --> 04:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
a new permitting process in Watershed
 
04:33:05.949 --> 04:33:05.959 align:start position:0%
which would need staff which which we do
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
not believe the funding is adequate
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
enough to pay
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
for so if you were to create that new
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
Under This legislation permitting
 
04:33:16.109 --> 04:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
position and permiting process it would
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
not get that individual out of the need
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
to get the permit onto 42a so it's a
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
redundant process you're just actually
 
04:33:26.310 --> 04:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
adding a layer of Regulation not
 
04:33:29.230 --> 04:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
creating an Avenue per
 
04:33:33.869 --> 04:33:33.879 align:start position:0%
se the it is true the process in RSA
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
42a 42 a
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
22-a is limited to use by
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities that is a fairly new
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
provision of law I believe it is less
 
04:33:46.269 --> 04:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
than 10 10 years old originally you
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
would have still been required to get a
 
04:33:51.629 --> 04:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
wetland permit under 42 A3 as excavation
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
removal and we would have simply put
 
04:33:55.990 --> 04:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
this under the normal Grant and right
 
04:33:58.629 --> 04:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
position Provisions for excavation of
 
04:34:03.310 --> 04:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
materials which is RSA 482 a21 and
 
04:34:06.150 --> 04:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
22 um and the reason for for this there
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
is a couple of things here that why that
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
fits into that provision under A3 in the
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
permit process Dees is going to look at
 
04:34:14.670 --> 04:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
the environmental impacts and decide if
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
the environmental impacts are such that
 
04:34:18.949 --> 04:34:18.959 align:start position:0%
it should or should not be allowed if
 
04:34:21.070 --> 04:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
Dees determines that the impacts are not
 
04:34:23.670 --> 04:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
significant so significant as there is
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
some reason this should not be allowed
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
then it's a transfer of property and I
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
believe there are several members here
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
who have brought that up there are two
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
different resource types that have been
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
discussed today
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
if something is on the bed of a stream
 
04:34:41.310 --> 04:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
or a river that is not the public trust
 
04:34:43.670 --> 04:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
stream or river bed unless it is title
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
is owned by the ab budding land
 
04:34:48.269 --> 04:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
owners the landowners of the adjacent
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
Properties or whoever owns that riverbed
 
04:34:52.990 --> 04:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
that's theirs we could not give it away
 
04:34:55.109 --> 04:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
to someone else you would need to have
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
the land owner's
 
04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
permission also when you're looking at
 
04:35:00.429 --> 04:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
streams and rivers it's been mentioned
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
that this is habitat I'm going to take a
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
slightly different approach on this if
 
04:35:07.150 --> 04:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
pile of logs has been in that River
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
since 1930s or 40s or even earlier in
 
04:35:12.189 --> 04:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
the early 1800s if the log jams go back
 
04:35:15.150 --> 04:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
that far they're embedded and that River
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
has reached a static equilibrium and
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
stable um level of stability with that
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
material anchoring in its sides and its
 
04:35:26.109 --> 04:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
bed if you're going to go in and remove
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
that material you run the risk of
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
destabilizing channels so I can assure
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
you that part of the review process for
 
04:35:35.470 --> 04:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
removal of that material under wetland
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
is going to be Channel stability the
 
04:35:39.070 --> 04:35:39.080 align:start position:0%
Army Core will require a hydraulic study
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
to determine how many logs how deep they
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
go what's the flow characteristics
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
because with the way the weather
 
04:35:45.990 --> 04:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
patterns have been going these days and
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
what we've been paying for in our
 
04:35:49.150 --> 04:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
Calbert and Bridge Replacements and
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
other Associated roadway damage one of
 
04:35:53.230 --> 04:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
the things we are definitely going to
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
key on is anything that destabilizes a
 
04:35:57.429 --> 04:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
river channel is not likely to get
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
approval so you've got a private
 
04:36:01.390 --> 04:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
ownership issue and a public safety
 
04:36:02.990 --> 04:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
issue associated with strip rivers and
 
04:36:05.150 --> 04:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
streams that we would look at under rsa4
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
2A for this
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
process if it's a Laker Pond greater
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
than 10 acres in size now you're part of
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
the public trust anything on the bed of
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
that Laker Pond is generally considered
 
04:36:18.990 --> 04:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
to be property of the people of the
 
04:36:20.551 --> 04:36:20.561 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire which is why it
 
04:36:22.189 --> 04:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
must go through governor and executive
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
counsel for the transfer of that
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
property it is a type of Grant of right
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
or Grant in right never know if I'm
 
04:36:30.910 --> 04:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to say of in we have attorneys
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
for that but it is a transfer of
 
04:36:36.429 --> 04:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
property current currently Dees does not
 
04:36:38.349 --> 04:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
set price for these things that is not
 
04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
our position um it is not within our
 
04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
purview to determine what the transfer
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
value the value of the transfer of goods
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
would be we would leave that to the
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
office the other uh one other thing I
 
04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
want to add to this though is I said
 
04:36:59.949 --> 04:36:59.959 align:start position:0%
normally this would be property of the
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire in Mr Irving's
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
package he had some information that I
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
had not seen before out of the national
 
04:37:04.719 --> 04:37:05.789 align:start position:0%
had not seen before out of the national
Arch

04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
Arch
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest reading through his
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
package it states that these logs were
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
purchased by the federal government in
 
04:37:14.830 --> 04:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
19 uh in a program that ran through
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
1943 one of the biggest issue is who
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
owns these if in fact they belong to us
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
as people of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we chose to allow them to be
 
04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
recovered and Governor executive Council
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
chose what an appropriate recovery cost
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
monetary price on that would be
 
04:37:37.349 --> 04:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
that would be fine I don't know how the
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
federal government would feel about it
 
04:37:40.750 --> 04:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
if in fact they purchased those logs and
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
we chose to give them to someone else
 
04:37:45.150 --> 04:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
and take a cut so those are the
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
ownership issues there are ownership and
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
stability issues that are actually the
 
04:37:51.029 --> 04:37:51.039 align:start position:0%
chief determinants of why this is
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
currently in Wetland St statute and it's
 
04:37:55.150 --> 04:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
in two different places one
 
04:37:57.910 --> 04:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
environmental one ownership and property
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
rights um again if you chose to the
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
legislature based on my background and
 
04:38:06.510 --> 04:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
what I've had to research late on other
 
04:38:09.830 --> 04:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
aspects of transfer of property and
 
04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
public Waters and public trust the
 
04:38:13.949 --> 04:38:13.959 align:start position:0%
legislature could Empower and could set
 
04:38:17.349 --> 04:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
a price scale if it chose to way as
 
04:38:18.670 --> 04:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
everybody else has said today way above
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
my pay grade but it is a transfer of
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
property is it a transfer of New
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's property Federal property or
 
04:38:27.310 --> 04:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
in a river private
 
04:38:30.629 --> 04:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
property and then stability issues and I
 
04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:32.561 align:start position:0%
I won't reiterate all the other habitat
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
issues that folks have have mentioned so
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's it in a nutshell it's a redundant
 
04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
process and there are some legal
 
04:38:42.070 --> 04:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
ramifications uh could you Empower an
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
individual to do it yes it was given to
 
04:38:46.269 --> 04:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities because at the time 10 12
 
04:38:48.269 --> 04:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
years ago people figured well towns do
 
04:38:50.349 --> 04:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
intent to cut maybe we'll kind of
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
consider this as part of the intent to
 
04:38:55.150 --> 04:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
cut push it off that way beyond that I
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
can take any questions and hopefully
 
04:38:58.629 --> 04:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
provide meaningful answers or at least
 
04:38:59.949 --> 04:38:59.959 align:start position:0%
write them down and get back to you at
 
04:38:59.959 --> 04:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
write them down and get back to you at
another

04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.840 --> 04:39:05.510 align:start position:0%
 
time

04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:39:08.109 --> 04:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
any questions from uh representative
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
post and anyone
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
else get in line so thank you Mr post um
 
04:39:20.629 --> 04:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
excuse me um I just forgot my question
 
04:39:23.470 --> 04:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
sorry all right I'll come back to get in
 
04:39:27.390 --> 04:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
get in line oh now you're me all right
 
04:39:28.910 --> 04:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
did you say whether you opposed it or
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
not the state is in opposition to this
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
bu okay thank you that was
 
04:39:37.628 --> 04:39:37.638 align:start position:0%
my any other questions by members of the
 
04:39:41.470 --> 04:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee I have H one or two uh thank
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh are you at
 
04:39:47.670 --> 04:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
all familiar with uh what Michigan is
 
04:39:50.470 --> 04:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
doing or some of the other states and
 
04:39:54.190 --> 04:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
why there why they
 
04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
fairly larger I have I have done some
 
04:40:03.150 --> 04:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
research on what the state of Michigan
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
is doing I've done some research on
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
other types of projects or other types
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
of activities in in Oregon and there's a
 
04:40:11.628 --> 04:40:11.638 align:start position:0%
couple of different reasons one is when
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
our logging may have started versus when
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
their logging Industries may have
 
04:40:19.310 --> 04:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
started another is the the way the state
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
is formed New Hampshire as one of the
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
oldest first King's Grand States you
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
know the transfer of property we have
 
04:40:31.470 --> 04:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
because of what king common law was
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
after in the way sovereignty was taken
 
04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
After the revolution Our Lake beds are
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
public trust other states so for
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
instance if you came as part of the
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Purchase it depends on the
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
original when that land was purchased
 
04:40:46.270 --> 04:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
what were the water rights granted as
 
04:40:47.910 --> 04:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
part of that in Oregon by the time
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're getting all the way to the West
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
Coast what were the federal laws that
 
04:40:54.310 --> 04:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
were in place when you know with the
 
04:40:56.430 --> 04:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
Homestead Act or whatever act covered
 
04:40:58.270 --> 04:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
The Taking of the land of Oregon and
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
turning it into a state and partitioning
 
04:41:03.390 --> 04:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
it out how you run your state program
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
and the transfer of property on the beds
 
04:41:08.270 --> 04:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
of lakes ponds or Rivers is completely
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
dependent upon how your state was formed
 
04:41:13.948 --> 04:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
as it was added to the union or as it
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
was purchased and and became part of
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
what is now the union so Oregon was flat
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
out P purchased in Oregon they hold
 
04:41:23.230 --> 04:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
ownership of the bed of rivers and
 
04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
streams where we do not unless their
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
title so you've got that underlying
 
04:41:30.948 --> 04:41:30.958 align:start position:0%
formation what your formation statutes
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
are and then the other thing is water is
 
04:41:36.190 --> 04:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
by biologies are different from from
 
04:41:37.830 --> 04:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
place to place in New England we are
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
blessed with having cold water which is
 
04:41:39.440 --> 04:41:40.430 align:start position:0%
blessed with having cold water which is
mostly

04:41:40.430 --> 04:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
oligotrophic um and you can see a great
 
04:41:44.670 --> 04:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
distance of depth may it stay cold for a
 
04:41:46.430 --> 04:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
long long time because that's what gives
 
04:41:49.670 --> 04:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
us our Clarity our lack of nutrients our
 
04:41:52.590 --> 04:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
concerns for what we do in cold water in
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are going to be different
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
and the reactivity of the way the
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
environment responds to activities is
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
going to be different than what happens
 
04:42:01.708 --> 04:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
in Virginia or
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
Florida so you've got different
 
04:42:05.150 --> 04:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
environmental concern concerns because
 
04:42:07.868 --> 04:42:07.878 align:start position:0%
of a different environmental temperature
 
04:42:09.628 --> 04:42:09.638 align:start position:0%
nutrients underlying soils
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics as well as the legal
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
basis for how things got to where they
 
04:42:16.990 --> 04:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
are and how many years of industrialized
 
04:42:21.788 --> 04:42:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:26.590 --> 04:42:26.600 align:start position:0%
materials any any other
 
04:42:28.910 --> 04:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
questions there being none thank you
 
04:42:31.510 --> 04:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
very much my number is on the letter if
 
04:42:33.868 --> 04:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
anybody has anything in followup please
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.030 --> 04:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Irving you wish to speak a second
 
04:42:47.350 --> 04:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
time uh I'll allow it make it quick um I
 
04:42:48.910 --> 04:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up real quick on
 
04:42:52.190 --> 04:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
two things um first I couldn't agree
 
04:42:54.430 --> 04:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
more with de's perspective that this
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be a redundant process and I don't
 
04:42:59.110 --> 04:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
want that I know how hard they work and
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
I don't want to make any more work for
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
them it's not my intention it would be
 
04:43:05.310 --> 04:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
nice to find a way to make this happen
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
um that wouldn't necessarily create a
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
whole another branch of Permitting and
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
all that I also wanted to agree with
 
04:43:12.910 --> 04:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
what the representative from fishing
 
04:43:15.868 --> 04:43:15.878 align:start position:0%
game said uh I actually sit on the B up
 
04:43:17.948 --> 04:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
County of conservation districts I'm
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
also on the board of the walki WAN
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
Watershed advisory committe so water
 
04:43:24.190 --> 04:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
quality is absolutely important and I'm
 
04:43:26.830 --> 04:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
not advocating that Joe public has cart
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
blanch on taking any type of wood out of
 
04:43:32.030 --> 04:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
any type of water body the bccd actually
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
works with trout unlimited to do in
 
04:43:37.150 --> 04:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
stream restoration work where we are
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
paying through grants and matching funds
 
04:43:42.948 --> 04:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
to drop trees into the lake into the
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
rivers rather so if you read that
 
04:43:47.510 --> 04:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
introductory letter that I submitted and
 
04:43:48.990 --> 04:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
look at the picture from the anders
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
scogan I totally appreciate that there
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
are certain types of wood that ought to
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
remain and trying to remove would be
 
04:43:57.550 --> 04:43:57.560 align:start position:0%
detrimental not only to the habitat not
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
only to the bank stabilization but
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
everything however there are some types
 
04:44:04.948 --> 04:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
of wood like the ones on the bottom of
 
04:44:07.150 --> 04:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
walki Wan which I think the benefits
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
outweigh the costs um just because it's
 
04:44:11.390 --> 04:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
a really great resource and I do not
 
04:44:14.310 --> 04:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
think and that obviously would depend on
 
04:44:16.110 --> 04:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
some studies I suppose but I don't think
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
the value is is should be should rule
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
out recovery of those logs whereas
 
04:44:24.670 --> 04:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
instream restoration or instream Timbers
 
04:44:26.430 --> 04:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
do provide a really really important
 
04:44:28.510 --> 04:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
resource so I couldn't agree with with
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
them more um on those points but I think
 
04:44:33.390 --> 04:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
there is still room to make something
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
happen in certain cases so that's
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you very
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
much any questions uh oh F before you go
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
any questions by any member of the
 
04:44:51.628 --> 04:44:51.638 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:45:01.270 --> 04:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
will I will adjourn the hearing
 
04:45:06.430 --> 04:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.910 --> 04:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
51 thank you and I will open the hearing
 
04:45:14.830 --> 04:45:14.840 align:start position:0%

04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's right all
 
04:45:40.560 --> 04:45:45.470 align:start position:0%
that's right all
right

04:45:45.470 --> 04:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:48.470 --> 04:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay what uh what are you
 
04:45:51.750 --> 04:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.948 --> 04:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
just was that Amendment okay it's the
 
04:45:56.470 --> 04:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I spoke to you about last we
 
04:46:00.550 --> 04:46:00.560 align:start position:0%

04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
in our lakes and rivers and there is no
 
04:48:50.868 --> 04:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
efficient way of communicating risk to
 
04:48:54.230 --> 04:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
the public although an understanding of
 
04:48:56.830 --> 04:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
conditions which contribute to blooms
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
namely runoff erosion malfunctioning
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
septic systems and warming water
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
temperatures are well known we as a
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
state do not have a strategy to develop
 
04:49:08.718 --> 04:49:09.788 align:start position:0%
state do not have a strategy to develop
and

04:49:09.788 --> 04:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
Implement management plans for
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
mitigation this is why convening a study
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
commission to comprehensively examine
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
this issue is needed not just to protect
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
public health and our natural resources
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
but to protect our economy over 17
 
04:49:30.670 --> 04:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
billion of value is brought to New
 
04:49:33.708 --> 04:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from Lake wabaki alone we have
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
leared learned that allowing cyano
 
04:49:37.788 --> 04:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms to become a chronic
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
occurrence makes them more difficult to
 
04:49:42.910 --> 04:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
overcome and raises the risk of serious
 
04:49:46.150 --> 04:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
disease for people living near impacted
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
Lakes I am also submitting which was
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
distributed Amendment 2022
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
29h which adds a representative to the
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
commission from the New Hampshire Rivers
 
04:50:00.750 --> 04:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
Council as New Hampshire rivers are also
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
suffering from cyanobacteria blooms so I
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your attention and
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
I um would would be happy to answer any
 
04:50:12.510 --> 04:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
have I should also say one other thing I
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
did get a request today from The Nature
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
Conservancy to have them added on to
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
this bill um I I really haven't uh
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
thought about that too much I may just
 
04:50:28.430 --> 04:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the committee to uh to
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
explore and and make a decision
 
04:50:32.840 --> 04:50:46.750 align:start position:0%
explore and and make a decision
upon

04:50:46.750 --> 04:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.628 --> 04:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
Sor me any
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Smith thank you
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
rung for introducing this bill and for
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
being here today um you know I am the
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
chair of the Exotic Aquatic weeds and
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
species committee and and the question
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
has been asked of me and I believe I
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
asked you also months ago could this
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
could this commission be made rolled
 
04:51:17.430 --> 04:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
into the uh weeds and species committee
 
04:51:19.750 --> 04:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
The Aquatic weeds and species
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
committee um I I don't really believe so
 
04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
um and for several reasons um aquatic
 
04:51:28.830 --> 04:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
weeds can be transferred from Lake to
 
04:51:30.910 --> 04:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
Lake they can be carried through boats
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
or other vehicles that can contaminate a
 
04:51:36.070 --> 04:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
lake cyano bacteria are actually
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
inherent to a lake they're found
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
naturally um and many of the uh uh
 
04:51:45.390 --> 04:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
considerations or the elements that
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
contribute to blooms don't have any
 
04:51:50.670 --> 04:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
commonality with exotic blooms I mean
 
04:51:53.830 --> 04:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
with exotic species of plants and
 
04:51:57.150 --> 04:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
animals um I also think too that the the
 
04:52:00.510 --> 04:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
health implications of cyano bacteria
 
04:52:02.910 --> 04:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
make it something that we should examine
 
04:52:02.920 --> 04:52:04.590 align:start position:0%
make it something that we should examine
specifically

04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
um you probably got a letter from Dr
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
Elijah STL he's a neurologist and a
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
professor at the geil school of medicine
 
04:52:14.270 --> 04:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth his he's one of the leading
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
researchers on the link between
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and
 
04:52:21.830 --> 04:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
ALS and um there some of the research
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
even suggests that residents that live
 
04:52:26.670 --> 04:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
even greater than 8 kilometers away from
 
04:52:28.470 --> 04:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
an impacted Lake could be at a higher
 
04:52:32.270 --> 04:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
risk of ALS so I think because of the
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
very serious health impacts of
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria the fact that they aren't
 
04:52:40.310 --> 04:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
um inherently they don't inherently
 
04:52:42.830 --> 04:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
infect go infect from one body of water
 
04:52:45.190 --> 04:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
to another means that we should really
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
focus uh specifically just on cyano
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:58.430 --> 04:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
Members representative
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
mville thank you Mr Sharon thank you
 
04:53:02.958 --> 04:53:05.270 align:start position:0%
mville thank you Mr Sharon thank you
representative

04:53:05.270 --> 04:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
I understand the mitigation efforts that
 
04:53:11.150 --> 04:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
can be used to combat sayano bacteria so
 
04:53:12.830 --> 04:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering maybe someone else
 
04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
will speak to this are there
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
remediation um solutions to combat this
 
04:53:21.868 --> 04:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
yes for very chronic lakes that have
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
suffered years and years um there are a
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
couple two primary ways of remediating
 
04:53:31.948 --> 04:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
it and one is to add copper sulfate to
 
04:53:35.310 --> 04:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
the lake and the other is um um um it's
 
04:53:38.110 --> 04:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
a it's an Alum type thing they're both
 
04:53:40.390 --> 04:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive they're not
 
04:53:43.070 --> 04:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
permanent and then you're also adding a
 
04:53:47.030 --> 04:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
chemical to a lake um the best and the
 
04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
reason for this commission is because I
 
04:53:53.070 --> 04:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the answers but um in in in
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
my experience in working on this issue
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
it's much more successful to um instead
 
04:54:03.110 --> 04:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
of remediation is to Med mitigate so
 
04:54:07.470 --> 04:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
ident identify what are the uh inputs
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
into the lake that are causing these
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
blooms now granted we can't do anything
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
about Rising water temperatures but we
 
04:54:18.990 --> 04:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
can um mitigate the uh runoff and
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
erosion failing septic systems things
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
that maybe 20 or 30 years ago wouldn't
 
04:54:26.590 --> 04:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
have triggered a bloom but because of
 
04:54:28.948 --> 04:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
increased water temperatures now they're
 
04:54:31.270 --> 04:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
they play much a much greater role so
 
04:54:34.750 --> 04:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
how do we do that um you know several
 
04:54:36.190 --> 04:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
lakes in New Hampshire that have
 
04:54:38.390 --> 04:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
suffered chronic blooms um and I'm
 
04:54:40.110 --> 04:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
thinking of Moma Lake which is the one
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
that triggered the research on Al also
 
04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
Mary meeting Lake and then the lake
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
where I spend my summmer Lake kisaka
 
04:54:50.788 --> 04:54:50.798 align:start position:0%
we've taken upon ourselves to fund and
 
04:54:52.590 --> 04:54:52.600 align:start position:0%
manage watershed management plan
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
developments and that's been very
 
04:54:56.548 --> 04:54:56.558 align:start position:0%
helpful to these communities um it's
 
04:54:59.470 --> 04:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
been able for them to identify that
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
those high impact projects they can do
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
that would prevent phosphorus which
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is a leading contributor to
 
04:55:07.910 --> 04:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria growth being able to
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
prevent them that from going into the
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
water um and so and and the other thing
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
too is um is is public awareness um
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
there is no way that in New Hampshire we
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
really can proactively inform people
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
that there is a bloom going on and that
 
04:55:32.910 --> 04:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
it could cause illness or death um DS
 
04:55:34.910 --> 04:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
has done a wonderful job we had a
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
wonderful program director for harmful
 
04:55:40.190 --> 04:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
alil program she recently left to join
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
the faculty at UNH um she was one person
 
04:55:45.910 --> 04:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
I think she had a couple interns working
 
04:55:48.548 --> 04:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
with her they would if they were aware
 
04:55:50.830 --> 04:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
of a suspected Bloom they would they
 
04:55:53.548 --> 04:55:53.558 align:start position:0%
would test sample and test and post it
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
to their website but it's information
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't Reach people who might be
 
04:56:00.750 --> 04:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
summering at the lake um there if it was
 
04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
a public beach there could be some post
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
posting but I think one of the roles I'm
 
04:56:08.430 --> 04:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
looking for this commission is to how do
 
04:56:11.230 --> 04:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
we communicate risk to those people who
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
are at high risk because right now there
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
way any other questions by members of
 
04:56:23.400 --> 04:56:24.948 align:start position:0%
way any other questions by members of
the

04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
committee all
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
right I have a question I have you know
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know I have
 
04:56:34.350 --> 04:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
questions and
 
04:56:36.270 --> 04:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
as I as I read the
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think I obviously I say I know
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms are a problem but much
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
of the as I read the bill much of the
 
04:56:52.708 --> 04:56:52.718 align:start position:0%
things that you're asking the commission
 
04:56:56.548 --> 04:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
to do are things
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
that a dozen people around the table
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
once a month can't get done uh you need
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
to have that should be things that
 
04:57:05.750 --> 04:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
should be done in
 
04:57:09.190 --> 04:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
the in the uh in the
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
department in other words find
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
out basically obtain information
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to Del to delineate the extent
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
of the cyano bacteria blooms commission
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
can't do that the department should be
 
04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
doing that uh if
 
04:57:30.590 --> 04:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's those are my concerns that we may
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
end up if we end up with a commission
 
04:57:36.548 --> 04:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
all they will be doing is telling us
 
04:57:40.190 --> 04:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
what we already know and not have
 
04:57:43.830 --> 04:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
activities action action items that's my
 
04:57:43.840 --> 04:57:44.788 align:start position:0%
activities action action items that's my
biggest

04:57:44.788 --> 04:57:44.798 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
04:57:47.110 --> 04:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
concern I respect that thank you very
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
much representative vulo but this is an
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
issue Caceria is such a serious issue
 
04:57:57.390 --> 04:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
and it's it takes a lot of all the
 
04:58:00.990 --> 04:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups to participate for
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
instance um yes de s could expand what
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
they're doing in harmful alil but
 
04:58:11.190 --> 04:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Society needs to be part of
 
04:58:12.670 --> 04:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
this and they're very eager to be a part
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
of this because they see a lot of
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
animals who are suffering from uh
 
04:58:19.230 --> 04:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
cyanotoxin Health and Human Services I
 
04:58:21.070 --> 04:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
mean education on
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
Physicians um uh I mean I didn't even
 
04:58:26.510 --> 04:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
know until I got a call from the
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Rivers
 
04:58:30.190 --> 04:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
Council that we were even seeing this in
 
04:58:32.910 --> 04:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
in rivers and as we heard the testimony
 
04:58:36.070 --> 04:58:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the previous speaker some Brooks or
 
04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
small water bodies may be on private
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
land that would be beyond the regulatory
 
04:58:44.590 --> 04:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
authority of Dees so I I understand your
 
04:58:47.190 --> 04:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
concern but I think um this is so
 
04:58:49.150 --> 04:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
critical that it's important to get as
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
many key stakeholders at the table as
 
04:58:54.670 --> 04:58:54.680 align:start position:0%
possible um many of you know that I
 
04:58:56.948 --> 04:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
chair the pasas commission which was an
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
a following HB 737 in
 
04:59:03.390 --> 04:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
2019 we've done tremendous work and we
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
have broad representation from we have
 
04:59:07.868 --> 04:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
UNH Dees
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh the
 
04:59:13.470 --> 04:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
USGS um and it really adds to the work
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
we've been able to do and the progress
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
we've been able to make on that
 
04:59:18.670 --> 04:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
commission and to be actually with this
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
bill I pretty much copy and pasted some
 
04:59:24.910 --> 04:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the wording from HB 737 because that
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:30.910 --> 04:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you any other questions by
 
04:59:34.510 --> 04:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
members represent representative post
 
04:59:35.788 --> 04:59:35.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
question um in in this document um from
 
04:59:44.430 --> 04:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
the doctor at Dartmouth um he says
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
compelling scientific evidence that many
 
04:59:50.948 --> 04:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
of the toxins produced by S I can't say
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
it that's okay can lead to human disease
 
04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
like cancer but are there any actual um
 
04:59:59.470 --> 04:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
studies confirming this I mean I know
 
05:00:01.948 --> 05:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
that's a statement but I would like to
 
05:00:06.110 --> 05:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
see what's supporting that there's a lot
 
05:00:07.868 --> 05:00:07.878 align:start position:0%
of peer-reviewed research that's been
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
published the link between cyanobacteria
 
05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
toxins and ALS was first discovered I
 
05:00:17.948 --> 05:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
think in the late 40s early 50s by the
 
05:00:19.948 --> 05:00:19.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Defense they
 
05:00:22.788 --> 05:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
had gone into Guam to settle Guam and
 
05:00:24.788 --> 05:00:24.798 align:start position:0%
noticed an extremely high incidence of
 
05:00:28.628 --> 05:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
ALS and and tracked back to um an amino
 
05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
acid type molecule that was found
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
naturally in some of the vegetation
 
05:00:32.600 --> 05:00:33.708 align:start position:0%
naturally in some of the vegetation
there

05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
and that got the research going um but
 
05:00:39.868 --> 05:00:39.878 align:start position:0%
saying it's been
 
05:00:42.910 --> 05:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
proven to cause I think there's so many
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
other factors I think if we look just in
 
05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at what's going on in
 
05:00:49.830 --> 05:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
Enfield New New Hampshire that was that
 
05:00:51.390 --> 05:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
triggered a lot of research the high
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
incidents of ALS um near Moma Lake which
 
05:00:57.708 --> 05:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
was suffering chronic cyano bacteria
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
blooms um there there is a linkage
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of research out there in
 
05:01:03.280 --> 05:01:04.510 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of research out there in
peerreview

05:01:04.510 --> 05:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
peerreview
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
journals um but um I think it's fair to
 
05:01:12.670 --> 05:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
say that cyanobacteria poses a high risk
 
05:01:16.230 --> 05:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
of someone Contracting ALS whether they
 
05:01:22.110 --> 05:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
story well follow up would would you
 
05:01:26.230 --> 05:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
have any of that information you could
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
send to us yes I would thank
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:01:35.948 align:start position:0%
you any other
questions

05:01:35.948 --> 05:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:45.548 --> 05:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:02.430 --> 05:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
now uh good afternoon members of the
 
05:02:02.440 --> 05:02:03.270 align:start position:0%
now uh good afternoon members of the
committee

05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:02:05.470 --> 05:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh chair Ren Zulo thank you for allowing
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
me for the opportunity to testify this
 
05:02:10.910 --> 05:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is David Neils I'm the
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh Chief aquatic biologist at the New
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
Services I also oversee the jod Connor
 
05:02:20.470 --> 05:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
luminology Center and we are basically
 
05:02:22.150 --> 05:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
charged with monitoring our surface
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
waters within the work that I do is the
 
05:02:28.750 --> 05:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh sinob bacteria harmful alab boom
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
position that uh representative run
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
talked about um I I want to also uh
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank representative Brown for giving a
 
05:02:39.070 --> 05:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
nice overview of Sino bacteria she could
 
05:02:41.070 --> 05:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
probably do part of my job she did a
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
great job talking about CYO bacteria so
 
05:02:44.830 --> 05:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to skip over sort of some of
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
the background stuff that she spoke
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
about and give you guys um an overview
 
05:02:52.030 --> 05:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
of what we deal with on a regular basis
 
05:02:53.548 --> 05:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Environmental
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
Services reg uh relative to cob
 
05:03:00.510 --> 05:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
bacteria over the past several years uh
 
05:03:03.990 --> 05:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have monitored Soo bacteria and on
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
average we have reports of about 30
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
water bodies a year that experience CYO
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms that continues to grow
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
every year it's hard to say whether
 
05:03:16.750 --> 05:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
those upward Trends are because more
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
people are looking or it's getting worse
 
05:03:21.510 --> 05:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's a combination of both we
 
05:03:25.030 --> 05:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
also issue advisories based on the how
 
05:03:27.868 --> 05:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
severe the CYO bacteria blooms are and
 
05:03:29.788 --> 05:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
those advisories go out on a public
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
website that people can view on average
 
05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
average we have about 6 to 800 days
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
collectively in a given year where
 
05:03:40.430 --> 05:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
recreational opportunities are
 
05:03:43.390 --> 05:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited or advised against on those
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
water bodies where CYO bacteria blooms
 
05:03:49.470 --> 05:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
occur so is very prevalent and we have
 
05:03:51.750 --> 05:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
um a lot of work that goes on throughout
 
05:03:56.670 --> 05:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
the summer I will also say that through
 
05:03:59.350 --> 05:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
that process we do microscopic
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
examinations that's how we determine how
 
05:04:03.628 --> 05:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
bad a bloom is
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
and last year uh we did about a thousand
 
05:04:11.910 --> 05:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
samples so that number that workload
 
05:04:15.390 --> 05:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
continues to go up every year and again
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
we're not sure whether that's because
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
things are getting worse or more people
 
05:04:21.910 --> 05:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
are looking but the need for that type
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
of work continues to increase
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
yearly the person that oversaw the
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
program our CYO bacteria program that
 
05:04:32.110 --> 05:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
has uh since departed and goed and gone
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
to un age um she was excellent but she
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
used to carry a cell phone around with
 
05:04:41.670 --> 05:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
her every day and on average that phone
 
05:04:45.070 --> 05:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
would ring with about 20 calls a day
 
05:04:47.230 --> 05:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
with people reporting sound of bacteria
 
05:04:49.708 --> 05:04:49.718 align:start position:0%
wounds she was the only person that
 
05:04:52.230 --> 05:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
managed that program with a couple of
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
interns of course she had assistance
 
05:04:55.948 --> 05:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
from her other staff in the biology
 
05:04:59.708 --> 05:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
group but she was really really overrun
 
05:05:03.430 --> 05:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
with managing both the sample Lo the
 
05:05:06.590 --> 05:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
microscopic examinations and answering
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
the phone calls and that's really the
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
critical part that we struggle with the
 
05:05:14.070 --> 05:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
department so needless to say there's
 
05:05:16.390 --> 05:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of work to be done and a
 
05:05:18.548 --> 05:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of work that we do do at the
 
05:05:18.558 --> 05:05:19.948 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of work that we do do at the
department

05:05:19.948 --> 05:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
now I won't go into the health risks
 
05:05:26.270 --> 05:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
other than to say that besides ALS not
 
05:05:28.948 --> 05:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
that that's not an important
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
consideration there are many
 
05:05:35.708 --> 05:05:35.718 align:start position:0%
acute uh factors that can uh occur from
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
C bacteria and that can be simply
 
05:05:41.270 --> 05:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
gastroenteritis and there are hundreds
 
05:05:44.030 --> 05:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of reports out there that
 
05:05:46.590 --> 05:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
report about the uh acute effects of
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
Sino bacteria they also can um manifest
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
themselves through inhalation and
 
05:05:54.670 --> 05:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
respiratory illnesses so it might seem
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
like somebody has a cough or a cold um
 
05:05:59.868 --> 05:05:59.878 align:start position:0%
that can be from inhalation the other
 
05:06:02.910 --> 05:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
thing is there can be very acute inci is
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
where nerve damage is done from certain
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
toxins and this has been reported Across
 
05:06:10.708 --> 05:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
the Nation and even New Hampshire where
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
pets die very quickly so it it can be
 
05:06:16.430 --> 05:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
very severe beyond the long-term effects
 
05:06:19.628 --> 05:06:19.638 align:start position:0%
not to minimize the long-term
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
effects the other thing I wanted to
 
05:06:23.310 --> 05:06:23.320 align:start position:0%
bring up is the impact on public water
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
supplies and that's really important I
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
think to point out is cyanotoxins are
 
05:06:31.750 --> 05:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
not just impactful for recreation but
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
they can have a severe impact if a
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
public water supply were to experience a
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
bloom we're very lucky in the state of
 
05:06:40.030 --> 05:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we haven't had a severe
 
05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
impact on our public water supply but if
 
05:06:44.830 --> 05:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
you've read some of the national news
 
05:06:46.990 --> 05:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
over the last five or 10 years you could
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
probably see the impact that Lake G had
 
05:06:52.590 --> 05:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
on a public water supply which blooms
 
05:06:56.110 --> 05:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
every year and um and several large
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
communities were impacted by the uh
 
05:07:01.230 --> 05:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
inability to use water from Lake yie
 
05:07:03.070 --> 05:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
because it was toxic
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
our two State uh largest state water
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers the Manchester Waterworks and
 
05:07:10.590 --> 05:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
Tenchu Waterworks they do actively
 
05:07:12.670 --> 05:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
engage in cob bacteria monitoring and
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
they're fortunate in that their water
 
05:07:17.070 --> 05:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
supplies have not been impacted but as
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
you probably know there's a lot of other
 
05:07:21.150 --> 05:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
smaller Public Water Supplies around the
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
state that just don't have that
 
05:07:26.310 --> 05:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
capacity So based on our
 
05:07:28.390 --> 05:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
experience we know that there's several
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
Lakes every year that we can count on
 
05:07:32.708 --> 05:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
blooming and these are are really
 
05:07:34.548 --> 05:07:34.558 align:start position:0%
problematic because we have challenges
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
right now diagnosing and correcting
 
05:07:38.190 --> 05:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
those problems and I think the cob
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
bacteria commission if it were to move
 
05:07:43.070 --> 05:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
forward be helpful in that we also have
 
05:07:45.948 --> 05:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
new Lakes every year that show up and
 
05:07:47.910 --> 05:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
those are surprising to those folks that
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
like to recreate or have a home on that
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
Lake also they could occur on Public
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
Water Supplies as I mentioned so those
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
are some of the challenges that we know
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
about in both cases we know there's way
 
05:08:06.030 --> 05:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
to to fix these problems but we really
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
have a hard time
 
05:08:11.708 --> 05:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
finding uh resources to complete those
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
fixes and identifying what the best fix
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
is today as I mentioned we're lucky that
 
05:08:20.430 --> 05:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't had a severe Bloom on P of
 
05:08:22.910 --> 05:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
Water Supplies but they have been noted
 
05:08:26.910 --> 05:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
occur we also like to point out that our
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
Bloom tracking system that we have and
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
notification system system that we have
 
05:08:35.868 --> 05:08:35.878 align:start position:0%
at the state does get a lot of use in
 
05:08:37.948 --> 05:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
fact it's one of the most popular I say
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
popular but most frequently visited
 
05:08:42.990 --> 05:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
websites that we have it's a map that
 
05:08:44.670 --> 05:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
people can click on like Google Maps and
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
it'll tell you which water bodies are
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
impacted by a cal bacteria wounds we
 
05:08:52.670 --> 05:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
also have a just a general listing as
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
well we also realize that this is
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
probably not the best system it works
 
05:09:00.430 --> 05:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
well but that can be improved upon and
 
05:09:02.190 --> 05:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
it is timec consuming for our staff to
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
to update on a daily basis we really
 
05:09:06.830 --> 05:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
think this commission this department
 
05:09:09.350 --> 05:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
does will help us better understand the
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
causes of CYO bacteria Blooms of course
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
as scientists we kind of know some of
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
these things but they're different on
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
each individual water
 
05:09:21.990 --> 05:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
body we also help we also know that um
 
05:09:23.150 --> 05:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
the commission will be helpful in
 
05:09:24.590 --> 05:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
getting input from others on the
 
05:09:27.470 --> 05:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
preferred options for cyano uh bacteria
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
tracking notification and
 
05:09:32.548 --> 05:09:32.558 align:start position:0%
Reporting we also think it would be
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
helpful to recommend the preferred
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
options for public education and
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
awareness and we'd also like to explore
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to enhance public water
 
05:09:43.230 --> 05:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
system monitoring and tracking we think
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
that's really critical to protect the
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
public health and last lastly we'd like
 
05:09:51.350 --> 05:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
to explore the best opportunities and
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
ways which we can tackle um options to
 
05:09:58.788 --> 05:09:58.798 align:start position:0%
reduce the causes of cob bacteria blooms
 
05:10:00.628 --> 05:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
and the risk of these occurring in our
 
05:10:03.868 --> 05:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
water bodies if P the agency looks
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
forward to participating on the
 
05:10:08.510 --> 05:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission and understanding what our
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
capacity is for mitigating the impacts
 
05:10:12.430 --> 05:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
of CYO bacteria on our state surface
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
waters so with that I'm happy to take
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
have thank you I have a I have a
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
question it sounds like you're you're
 
05:10:30.750 --> 05:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
you're the fireman putting out the fires
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
constantly and
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that but is there someone
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
who is out there trying to figure out
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
what the fire is and what how to how to
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
put that put all the uh how to stop the
 
05:10:48.910 --> 05:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
arsonist from doing all of the
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
fires I mean who who in the
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
department does that job so like I said
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'm the chief aquatic biologist I have a
 
05:11:00.590 --> 05:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
staff of about 10 people most of the
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
people are biologists and we're all
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
charged with monitoring our state's
 
05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
surface waters we have several people
 
05:11:08.470 --> 05:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
that work for me that do specialize in
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
Lake ecology and together we work on
 
05:11:11.638 --> 05:11:12.830 align:start position:0%
Lake ecology and together we work on
figuring

05:11:12.830 --> 05:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
figuring
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
out uh ways to deal with Lakes we don't
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the one position we have for
 
05:11:20.750 --> 05:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
tracking CYO bacteria we don't have a
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
specific sort of position designated to
 
05:11:26.670 --> 05:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
identify the causes of problems if
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
you're asking me who the arsonists are
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
collectively we all the arsonists and
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
historically all the people before us
 
05:11:38.510 --> 05:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
that used our
 
05:11:38.520 --> 05:11:40.230 align:start position:0%
that used our
Lakes

05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
05:11:40.240 --> 05:11:42.548 align:start position:0%
Lakes
okay

05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:45.910 --> 05:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative post thank you
 
05:11:49.070 --> 05:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
um so earlier um the speaker talked
 
05:11:53.150 --> 05:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
about um in Guam it was naturally
 
05:11:56.548 --> 05:11:56.558 align:start position:0%
occurring there could that be our issue
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
here or have you looked at it from a
 
05:11:58.718 --> 05:11:59.788 align:start position:0%
here or have you looked at it from a
Global

05:11:59.788 --> 05:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
Global
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
Perspective um could you give us some
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
information on that sure absolutely um
 
05:12:07.350 --> 05:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
as representative rung noted CYO
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
bacteria are natural component of all of
 
05:12:12.548 --> 05:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
our water bodies they're a part of the
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
natural pled Community the issue that
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
we've seen is that they become dominant
 
05:12:19.868 --> 05:12:19.878 align:start position:0%
when excessive nutrients become
 
05:12:23.230 --> 05:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
available for their production we also
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
know that increases in
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
temperature and uh nutrient inputs from
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
external sources and ex and internal
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
sources can greatly impact the
 
05:12:36.548 --> 05:12:36.558 align:start position:0%
likelihood that cob bacteria can bloom
 
05:12:40.510 --> 05:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
so it is an issue that's being dealt
 
05:12:42.990 --> 05:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
with Worldwide it's not unique to New
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's not unique to New
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
England but it is a prevalent
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and I I would say relatively new
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
occurrence although that they've been
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
part of our uh aquatic communities for a
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
long time and and looking back in in
 
05:13:04.230 --> 05:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
some of the records we have we have
 
05:13:07.430 --> 05:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
records of blooms on New Hampshire Lakes
 
05:13:10.310 --> 05:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
going way back to the 50s it's the
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
prevalence of those blooms and the
 
05:13:16.830 --> 05:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of what those CYO bacteria
 
05:13:19.628 --> 05:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
how they can impact our human health is
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
what's really leading to the increase
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
that um also I I think in the past we've
 
05:13:35.030 --> 05:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
talked about it being caused potentially
 
05:13:38.070 --> 05:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
from putting
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
um growth products on our Lawns and to
 
05:13:43.030 --> 05:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
keep them looking beautiful and things
 
05:13:44.910 --> 05:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
like that are they still thinking that
 
05:13:47.830 --> 05:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
is the cause that's going into our water
 
05:13:49.510 --> 05:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
systems and then getting passed down
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
through the aquifer is that there are a
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
number of factors that can um promote
 
05:14:00.628 --> 05:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
zobac Bloom certainly fertilizers can be
 
05:14:03.190 --> 05:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
one of them I will not that I think it
 
05:14:06.390 --> 05:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
was back in the 80s that uh phosphorus
 
05:14:09.430 --> 05:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
was banned from most fertilizers they're
 
05:14:11.150 --> 05:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
still allowed to be used in starter
 
05:14:14.510 --> 05:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
fertilizers so um that is one of the
 
05:14:16.230 --> 05:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
limiting nutrients in our Lakes the
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
unique thing about
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria is they may be able to to
 
05:14:25.510 --> 05:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of excess nitrogen
 
05:14:28.270 --> 05:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
amounts and when you put fertilizer on
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
your lawn it is loaded with nitrogen so
 
05:14:33.868 --> 05:14:33.878 align:start position:0%
and that and that's of course why we
 
05:14:36.910 --> 05:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
have um the Shoreland protection act
 
05:14:38.868 --> 05:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
which restricts the amount of fertilizer
 
05:14:41.390 --> 05:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
you can put so that's one of the factors
 
05:14:46.430 --> 05:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
Huff thank you Mr chair thank you for uh
 
05:14:57.430 --> 05:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
to what I'm hearing and what I'm I just
 
05:15:02.910 --> 05:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure is basically there's a
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
lot of possible causes um from runoff
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
from nutrients um from Lake Heating from
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh septic systems all of these things in
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
in in uh
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
conjunction and I'm what I'm think I'm
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearing is is we just don't know those
 
05:15:22.590 --> 05:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
are posses but we don't actually know
 
05:15:25.030 --> 05:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the purpose of this is that
 
05:15:27.270 --> 05:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
am I correct in that
 
05:15:30.548 --> 05:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
assumption I think the purpose as I
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand the purpose of the Comm is is
 
05:15:37.030 --> 05:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
multifaceted that would be one of the of
 
05:15:44.350 --> 05:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:48.868 --> 05:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:51.070 --> 05:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:02.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
you

opportunity to testify in support of
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1066 which would give which
 
05:16:39.628 --> 05:16:39.638 align:start position:0%
would create a cob bacteria study
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
commission um I've included and passed
 
05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
out a letter of testimony in support of
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
the bill which has been signed by eight
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%

who are dedicated to keeping New
 
05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's lakes and rivers clean and
 
05:17:14.830 --> 05:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
healthy um I won't tell you what you
 
05:17:17.548 --> 05:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
already know but our Lakes are sick in
 
05:17:19.830 --> 05:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
2021 there's a record number of toxic
 
05:17:22.270 --> 05:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and rivers
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide and we know what the causes of
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms are as noted
 
05:17:29.270 --> 05:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
increased nutrients including phosphorus
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
from sources such as fertilizer septic
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
system waste soil being washed into our
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes we know the effects of cyano
 
05:17:38.510 --> 05:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms and that they're not a
 
05:17:40.270 --> 05:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
threat to the use and enjoyment of our
 
05:17:41.990 --> 05:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers but they have the
 
05:17:43.948 --> 05:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
potential for far-reaching and long-term
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
consequences to human and animal health
 
05:17:49.110 --> 05:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh notably New Hampshire's tourism
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
economy and lakefront property values
 
05:17:53.390 --> 05:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
are also at risk as people are less and
 
05:17:55.350 --> 05:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
less likely to visit and buy property on
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:00.628 --> 05:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
bodies what we don't know and what the
 
05:18:02.310 --> 05:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
study Commission has the opportunity to
 
05:18:04.788 --> 05:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
investigate is exactly how to address
 
05:18:06.788 --> 05:18:06.798 align:start position:0%
the Gap in current state laws and
 
05:18:08.548 --> 05:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
programs to come up with Cutting Edge
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
Solutions including legislation to begin
 
05:18:13.948 --> 05:18:13.958 align:start position:0%
combating cyano bacteria's impact on New
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this issue can't be siloed
 
05:18:19.548 --> 05:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
into one state agency or program alone
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
it's multifaceted
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary problem that cuts
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
across many sectors of society and state
 
05:18:27.750 --> 05:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
government so without bringing this
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
commission together it's unlikely that
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
this issue can be addressed by one
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
agency or governing body it's time to
 
05:18:35.708 --> 05:18:35.718 align:start position:0%
bring a diverse group of stakeholders to
 
05:18:37.310 --> 05:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
the table to address this issue
 
05:18:39.150 --> 05:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensively and begin mitigating its
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:56.310 --> 05:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
committee representative Smith thank you
 
05:18:59.070 --> 05:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Miss Davis for uh
 
05:19:02.670 --> 05:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um since you are uh
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire lakes and you you
 
05:19:07.910 --> 05:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
know interact with a lot of people or
 
05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
you hear from a lot of people when you
 
05:19:11.948 --> 05:19:11.958 align:start position:0%
have the lake host program or uh
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
Adventures out on the lake with as a
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
community um are you hearing reports
 
05:19:19.708 --> 05:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
from people about cyano bacteria people
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
who've been out boating or swimming or
 
05:19:25.270 --> 05:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
recreating on the Lakes absolutely um we
 
05:19:27.310 --> 05:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
hear uh consistently throughout the
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
summer people's concerns over
 
05:19:31.750 --> 05:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms um we're hearing
 
05:19:34.510 --> 05:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
stories about people who are uh
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
contemplating selling their lake houses
 
05:19:38.430 --> 05:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
and moving to lakes that are uh less
 
05:19:41.190 --> 05:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
affected by Cal bacteria blooms um we're
 
05:19:42.590 --> 05:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
hearing about people who are choosing
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
not to recreate in their Lakes for most
 
05:19:47.230 --> 05:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
of the you know the hot summer months of
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
July and August and September because
 
05:19:51.070 --> 05:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
they just don't want to take the risk
 
05:19:53.430 --> 05:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard of people whose you know
 
05:19:55.390 --> 05:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
college age and adult children are not
 
05:19:57.190 --> 05:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
choosing to come back to the lake that
 
05:20:00.150 --> 05:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
they grew up on um for the same reasons
 
05:20:02.110 --> 05:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
and and not bringing to the lake with
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
them for those reasons um or their or
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
their you know or grandchildren so it's
 
05:20:11.110 --> 05:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's becoming um more and more obvious
 
05:20:12.750 --> 05:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
that the problem is growing and that
 
05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
people are aware of the issue and and
 
05:20:17.230 --> 05:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
making their choices about how to recre
 
05:20:19.548 --> 05:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
and how to use the lake
 
05:20:25.470 --> 05:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.510 --> 05:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
you representative post for a question
 
05:20:30.390 --> 05:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do you have any
 
05:20:33.708 --> 05:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
programs um for around the lakes and
 
05:20:36.548 --> 05:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
things where you promote um healthy
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
behaviors for treating the lakes and are
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
there any um uh private homeowners
 
05:20:47.868 --> 05:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
businesses cooperatives to get the news
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
out maybe um at marinas and things like
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
that where people would go to rent a
 
05:20:55.390 --> 05:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
boat and say you know these are the
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
things that you need to um not put in
 
05:21:01.430 --> 05:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
maybe use certain detergents things like
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
that for people who are renting homes on
 
05:21:06.910 --> 05:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
the lake I mean has there been anything
 
05:21:11.230 --> 05:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
like that to to get a public um you know
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
campaign going to try to prevent
 
05:21:18.510 --> 05:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah New Hampshire Lakes uh runs a
 
05:21:21.070 --> 05:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
program called Lakes smart um and there
 
05:21:23.470 --> 05:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
are several other Lake Associations
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
around the state who run similar
 
05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
programs um the Lakes smart program is a
 
05:21:31.830 --> 05:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary non-regulatory program where
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners take self assessments of
 
05:21:37.708 --> 05:21:37.718 align:start position:0%
their property and that is in everything
 
05:21:39.628 --> 05:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
including you know what kind of
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
detergents and home cleaning products
 
05:21:44.708 --> 05:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
they're using to their septic systems to
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
drip lines around their roofs uh
 
05:21:50.750 --> 05:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
fertilizer use Woodland buffers natural
 
05:21:53.510 --> 05:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
plantings in their in their yards the
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
reduction of salt use in their driveways
 
05:21:59.310 --> 05:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
and and reduction of of open lawn
 
05:22:01.708 --> 05:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
areas um and then
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
after the self assessment New Hampshire
 
05:22:05.708 --> 05:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
Lake staff or other Lake Association
 
05:22:07.708 --> 05:22:07.718 align:start position:0%
staff will go out and visit the
 
05:22:11.030 --> 05:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
properties um confirm sort of some of
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
the that self assessment and then give
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to improve um their
 
05:22:19.948 --> 05:22:19.958 align:start position:0%
their choices on how they're using and
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
managing their properties um and then if
 
05:22:25.788 --> 05:22:25.798 align:start position:0%
the property meets certain criteria they
 
05:22:30.030 --> 05:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
will be uh awarded a lak smart award um
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
which we're really proud of of and um a
 
05:22:33.830 --> 05:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
lot of homeowners are really proud to
 
05:22:36.670 --> 05:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
display that um the program is growing
 
05:22:38.830 --> 05:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
but it's still um you know boots on the
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
ground effort we also um partner with uh
 
05:22:47.470 --> 05:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
local businesses so we have um a Lakes
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
smart service provider program and those
 
05:22:52.470 --> 05:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
businesses are everything from Realtors
 
05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
to landscapers to snow removal
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
professionals um that partner with us
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
and those are all uh businesses that are
 
05:23:03.590 --> 05:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
committed to um to maintaining Lake
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
friendly practices in their in their
 
05:23:05.480 --> 05:23:09.310 align:start position:0%
friendly practices in their in their
business

05:23:09.310 --> 05:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
day-to-day have you seen um any
 
05:23:14.190 --> 05:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
improvements since starting this program
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
and how long has the program um been
 
05:23:19.548 --> 05:23:19.558 align:start position:0%
going the program's been going uh for a
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
few years and I I don't necessarily have
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
an answer as far as improvements go I
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot of people that have not
 
05:23:27.990 --> 05:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
received a Lakes smart award have gone
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
back into their property and done some
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
of those those recommended changes in
 
05:23:34.670 --> 05:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
order to receive that Lake smart award
 
05:23:35.990 --> 05:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a really
 
05:23:38.430 --> 05:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful um thing that people are doing
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
I think in order to really see clear
 
05:23:43.990 --> 05:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
improvements related from uh the Lakes
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
smart program to um to impacts on cyano
 
05:23:50.750 --> 05:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
bacteria it has to be a whole Watershed
 
05:23:54.030 --> 05:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
or whole lake um effort uh you know one
 
05:23:55.788 --> 05:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
person updating their septic system are
 
05:23:57.628 --> 05:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
not using fertilizer isn't going to
 
05:23:59.910 --> 05:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of cob bacteria blooms
 
05:24:02.910 --> 05:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
on an entire Lake um but these these
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
individuals taking these steps you know
 
05:24:06.548 --> 05:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
incrementally will make a difference
 
05:24:06.558 --> 05:24:08.030 align:start position:0%
incrementally will make a difference
over

05:24:08.030 --> 05:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:24:11.310 --> 05:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
time one more followup
 
05:24:15.788 --> 05:24:15.798 align:start position:0%
please is there anyone um keeping
 
05:24:19.150 --> 05:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
records of this program starting and the
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
followup what's happening in the the
 
05:24:23.868 --> 05:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
lake areas that that people are
 
05:24:27.070 --> 05:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
participating in and if not um I think
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
it would be a great idea that would help
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
every everyone understand if these
 
05:24:34.670 --> 05:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
things are actually making a
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
difference are you are you asking if we
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
have records of the Lakes smart visits
 
05:24:41.150 --> 05:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
that we've done are you are you keeping
 
05:24:45.110 --> 05:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
track this year um so many people
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
participated and we didn't have as many
 
05:24:50.430 --> 05:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
blooms this year or you know someone
 
05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
keeping track over the years of of the
 
05:24:57.230 --> 05:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
program increasing in participation if
 
05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
that makes any kind of difference um I
 
05:25:01.628 --> 05:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
know that we have lak stats that I can
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
certainly send to the committee based on
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
how many visits we've done and and where
 
05:25:07.270 --> 05:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
they've they've been done and I can
 
05:25:09.230 --> 05:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
certainly forward that along to you I
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't know that we have statistics on a
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
any correlation between blooms and and
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
lakes smart visits and I think it's hard
 
05:25:18.150 --> 05:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
to make those those connections
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily because you know if you have
 
05:25:21.990 --> 05:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
a particularly hot dry summer you might
 
05:25:24.910 --> 05:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
see more blooms or if you have a hot dry
 
05:25:26.990 --> 05:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
spell and then a major rain event that's
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
a trigger to a bloom and so com Cor
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
ating Lakes smart visits solely with
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
with CYO bacteria blooms I don't think
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's necessarily um an a parallel
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's a lot of factors
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
that go into um the occurrence of the
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:54.310 --> 05:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much I
 
05:25:57.750 --> 05:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your indulging me
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
um have you thought about participation
 
05:26:02.510 --> 05:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
with someone like UNH and things like
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
that to do long-term
 
05:26:08.030 --> 05:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
studies um I I don't I don't have I
 
05:26:09.470 --> 05:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that and I can
 
05:26:11.310 --> 05:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
certainly follow up with you on that I
 
05:26:13.230 --> 05:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
think that would be a good idea I mean
 
05:26:15.070 --> 05:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
especially there's so many Lake
 
05:26:17.830 --> 05:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
Associations in New Hampshire you got
 
05:26:20.788 --> 05:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
these people together I think that um it
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
could make a huge difference and even if
 
05:26:26.750 --> 05:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
you had homeowners you know keep track
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
of things by their section because
 
05:26:30.628 --> 05:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes I know blooms happen in
 
05:26:32.430 --> 05:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative you're test you're
 
05:26:34.750 --> 05:26:34.760 align:start position:0%

05:27:57.390 --> 05:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
Council board of directors and I thank
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
Michelle Davis for a very nice lead into
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
what I intended to say
 
05:28:04.430 --> 05:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
today I ask this committee to fully
 
05:28:07.470 --> 05:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 1066 including the
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
amendment by representative rung to add
 
05:28:11.628 --> 05:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Rivers Council as a member
 
05:28:12.788 --> 05:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
of the study
 
05:28:15.110 --> 05:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee although cyano bacteria are
 
05:28:16.990 --> 05:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring in our States lakes
 
05:28:19.830 --> 05:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
ponds rivers and streams when conditions
 
05:28:21.788 --> 05:28:21.798 align:start position:0%
become favorable through high water
 
05:28:23.788 --> 05:28:23.798 align:start position:0%
temperatures and particularly with
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
nutrients are present blooms can happen
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere because of our common concerns
 
05:28:31.390 --> 05:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Rivers Council has
 
05:28:33.110 --> 05:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
co-signed the letter presented by New
 
05:28:35.670 --> 05:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes I have firsthand
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
experience with a significant bloom last
 
05:28:40.750 --> 05:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
summer on June 8th a suspected
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria Bloom adjacent to my beach
 
05:28:46.390 --> 05:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
on Lower Suncook Lake was reported to
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
Suncook Lakes Association which reported
 
05:28:51.190 --> 05:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire Lakes which then
 
05:28:54.510 --> 05:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
contacted Dees Dees investigated and
 
05:28:56.510 --> 05:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
confirmed the
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
bloom we have never had a bloom on Lower
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
Sun L either before or
 
05:29:05.350 --> 05:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
after as it turns out a neighbor on the
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
waterfront applied fertilizer to his
 
05:29:10.110 --> 05:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
entire site including within the 25 foot
 
05:29:12.350 --> 05:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
boundary right along the lake and along
 
05:29:14.830 --> 05:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
the entire stream that runs through his
 
05:29:16.910 --> 05:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
property this was done about a week
 
05:29:19.868 --> 05:29:19.878 align:start position:0%
before the bloom occurred uh and it we
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
had significant rains after the
 
05:29:23.510 --> 05:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
fertilizer was laid
 
05:29:26.070 --> 05:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
down as I said this is very distressing
 
05:29:29.070 --> 05:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
to the people on Lower sunkook Lake who
 
05:29:31.948 --> 05:29:31.958 align:start position:0%
have never experienced a BL before now
 
05:29:33.510 --> 05:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
other neighbors have concerns over
 
05:29:35.150 --> 05:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
potential impacts to the lake water
 
05:29:37.190 --> 05:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
quality resulting from such activities
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
that are already strictly forbidden
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
under the Shoreland water quality
 
05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
protection act my wife and I so enjoyed
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
the lake we bought the cottage not for
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
ourselves but for the enjoyment of our
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
family and our
 
05:29:52.948 --> 05:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
grandkids we love teaching our kids
 
05:29:55.548 --> 05:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
about the environment our Our Lake and
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%

05:30:04.510 --> 05:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
Chipmunks that the kids feed by
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
hand over the years our dogs have been
 
05:30:09.270 --> 05:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
in and out of the lake and we literally
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
can't keep our grandkids out of the
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
water safety is always our top concern
 
05:30:13.440 --> 05:30:14.470 align:start position:0%
water safety is always our top concern
for

05:30:14.470 --> 05:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:30:16.708 --> 05:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
them this is just one instance of a
 
05:30:19.150 --> 05:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
bloom that isn't supposed to happen the
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
bill clearly outlines the importance of
 
05:30:22.230 --> 05:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
controlling the factors that lead to
 
05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
blooms and management of blooms once
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
they do occur all of us here must be
 
05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
concerned about water quality and safety
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
I again ask that you support the
 
05:30:31.948 --> 05:30:31.958 align:start position:0%
formation of the study committee and the
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
issuance of a final report as quickly as
 
05:30:36.628 --> 05:30:36.638 align:start position:0%
possible five years just seems to be way
 
05:30:39.788 --> 05:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
too long for studying uh the situation
 
05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
leading to
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'll be happy to answer
 
05:30:43.680 --> 05:30:48.110 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'll be happy to answer
any

05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by any member of
 
05:30:50.718 --> 05:30:52.830 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by any member of
the

05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:30:54.910 --> 05:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
05:30:59.150 --> 05:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.160 --> 05:31:05.070 align:start position:0%
 
time

05:31:05.070 --> 05:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's the all of the remaining cards I
 
05:31:10.470 --> 05:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
did have one question of the uh uh of
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
the representative representative rung
 
05:31:20.030 --> 05:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
say the presenter uh yes Mr uh I think
 
05:31:24.430 --> 05:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
u in the bill there's it talks about
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
having the harmful algae cyanobacterial
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
bloom program coordin from the
 
05:31:33.788 --> 05:31:33.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Research
 
05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
Services or design is there that that
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
person exist now uh that position's open
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
the person who held it um was the one
 
05:31:45.708 --> 05:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
that took a position with UNH okay on
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
their faculty I would anticipate DS
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
would either fill that position or
 
05:31:54.030 --> 05:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
assign a designate okay and also an
 
05:31:56.110 --> 05:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
invironmental engineer specializing in
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
watershed management planning is that
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
someone from the
 
05:32:06.030 --> 05:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
outside just yeah yes mainly um Lake
 
05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
Associations who've experienced blooms
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
particularly when they've been Chon
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
become chronic uh typically raise money
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
to fund watershed management plan
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
developments and uh there are many
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
contractors Consultants throughout New
 
05:32:22.868 --> 05:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
England throughout the country that do
 
05:32:25.628 --> 05:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
this kind of work to identify sources of
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh runoff or nut actually what I was
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
aiming at is does this require
 
05:32:35.150 --> 05:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
additional Personnel no there's people
 
05:32:37.910 --> 05:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
out there that was my aim maybe I wasn't
 
05:32:37.920 --> 05:32:39.470 align:start position:0%
out there that was my aim maybe I wasn't
okay

05:32:39.470 --> 05:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative Smith you had a
 
05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
question well yes I do thank you very
 
05:32:46.670 --> 05:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
much and thank you again representative
 
05:32:51.310 --> 05:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
R um the as as represent as Mr chair
 
05:32:54.750 --> 05:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
said an environmental engineer
 
05:32:57.310 --> 05:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
um do you have any thoughts on who that
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
person would be appointed by um um
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
because that should probably be in the
 
05:33:05.990 --> 05:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
bill no I really haven't um I think in
 
05:33:08.430 --> 05:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is it stated that it would be
 
05:33:12.350 --> 05:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
nominated by the Senators okay I'll I'll
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll revisit that and the other
 
05:33:16.510 --> 05:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
question I have is do you really think
 
05:33:18.670 --> 05:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get two senators who will attend
 
05:33:18.680 --> 05:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
we'll get two senators who will attend
these

05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
meetings yeah I I don't know I mean it's
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
always a problem with senators and
 
05:33:26.548 --> 05:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
usually when the bill goes to the Senate
 
05:33:28.990 --> 05:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
they take off one of the Senators too
 
05:33:32.190 --> 05:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I'll defer to the uh but
 
05:33:34.110 --> 05:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
but I do know you know going back to my
 
05:33:36.430 --> 05:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
experience on the Pas commission uh
 
05:33:39.990 --> 05:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Senators Daniels and Carson make
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
most of the meetings and um and they
 
05:33:44.110 --> 05:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
definitely have a vested interest
 
05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
because of that groundwater
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
contamination affects their
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
communities and I mean just anecdotally
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
from my involvement in this issue is
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
there are people that are really they're
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
frightened they're scared they want the
 
05:33:58.150 --> 05:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
state to do something I think they would
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that their Senator would
 
05:34:03.390 --> 05:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
participate but I would leave if if the
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
the committee doesn't believe that um
 
05:34:09.070 --> 05:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate that position would be able
 
05:34:12.110 --> 05:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
to be honored on that I would be open to
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment to reduce it to maybe one
 
05:34:18.110 --> 05:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
Senate but I I do expect the reason that
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate representatives are on the
 
05:34:22.830 --> 05:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
commission is that there's likely going
 
05:34:25.628 --> 05:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
to be budgeting issues there's likely
 
05:34:28.430 --> 05:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
going to be some policy recommendations
 
05:34:30.830 --> 05:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
that may require a legis lative remedy
 
05:34:34.110 --> 05:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
and so to have that buyin from both uh
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the house and the Senate I
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
think are going to be important for any
 
05:34:40.628 --> 05:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
legislation that moves
 
05:34:42.910 --> 05:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
forward quick
 
05:34:45.590 --> 05:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
followup which brings me to five State
 
05:34:48.548 --> 05:34:48.558 align:start position:0%
reps which you know it is so challenging
 
05:34:51.150 --> 05:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
to find state reps who will attend
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
commission and committee hearings um of
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions so just consider
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
if we could do with less of those also I
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
mean we can do whatever we want now that
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
we have the bill but I just wanted to
 
05:35:06.390 --> 05:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
approach that subject and and I will say
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
that um the bill as submitted as the LSR
 
05:35:11.390 --> 05:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
when it went through the process there
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
was a an error on the part of os um
 
05:35:17.190 --> 05:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
there were probably eight
 
05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives that signed on as
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill but the only
 
05:35:24.670 --> 05:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
one that made it I I noticed this eror
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
and it was too late to um remediate it
 
05:35:30.270 --> 05:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
but uh that's why Senator PR and I are
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
the only ones on the bill but it had
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
very strong support from Senate from
 
05:35:36.590 --> 05:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
representatives in The Lakes Region yes
 
05:35:44.030 --> 05:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:47.230 --> 05:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative maville thank you Mr
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
chair um representative R thank you for
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
taking the question I was wondering I I
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
was looking at the various um uh duties
 
05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the commission and I was thinking
 
05:35:58.868 --> 05:35:58.878 align:start position:0%
about stakeholders as just previously
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned and I I was just wondering if
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
because it seems that the source and
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
impact of the surface water includes
 
05:36:06.070 --> 05:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
fertilization and includes some of the
 
05:36:09.230 --> 05:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
land owners that perhaps maybe um a
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
thought might be to include the
 
05:36:13.390 --> 05:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
Landscaping Association of New Hampshire
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
or the New Hampshire realtors
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
association as just a couple of other
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that would Encompass that
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
that bulk of people thank you for that
 
05:36:23.430 --> 05:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion I think that's worthwhile
 
05:36:26.110 --> 05:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
many of them are involved in uh Lake
 
05:36:29.230 --> 05:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
Associations anyway so there we may get
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
that involved involvement but I do
 
05:36:32.990 --> 05:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the challenge with
 
05:36:35.230 --> 05:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
something like this is like for instance
 
05:36:36.910 --> 05:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
when I got when I got the email today
 
05:36:39.030 --> 05:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
from the new from The Nature Conservancy
 
05:36:41.390 --> 05:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
to add it on we're already I think at 19
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
members so with the with the New
 
05:36:45.948 --> 05:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rivers associ Council so there
 
05:36:48.670 --> 05:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
is a concern about having it too
 
05:36:52.590 --> 05:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
unwieldy but um you know and but I do
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
think it's important to have the the
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
elected representation I guess it's
 
05:36:59.070 --> 05:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
there's needs to be a balance to be find
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
out who can who can participate now I
 
05:37:03.628 --> 05:37:03.638 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire Lakes um part of
 
05:37:05.910 --> 05:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
their programming is they do certify
 
05:37:09.548 --> 05:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
land landscapers and people that service
 
05:37:12.190 --> 05:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
waterfront property to make sure that
 
05:37:14.590 --> 05:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
they have best practices environmental
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
practices so that may be a channel
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%

Services the report was needed for the

05:39:18.830 --> 05:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
of their long-term efforts to protect
 
05:39:22.830 --> 05:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
the pond this report the Perkins Pond
 
05:39:26.510 --> 05:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
diagnostic feasibility study
 
05:39:29.990 --> 05:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
2009 describes what the future of this
 
05:39:33.350 --> 05:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
small and extremely shallow Pond could
 
05:39:36.430 --> 05:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
be as increased development of the
 
05:39:40.350 --> 05:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
shoreline and the Watershed took place
 
05:39:43.350 --> 05:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
the Perkins Pond Association decided to
 
05:39:46.590 --> 05:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
continue their efforts by recommending
 
05:39:49.310 --> 05:39:49.320 align:start position:0%
replacement of the existing sewage
 
05:39:53.350 --> 05:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
systems chiefly septic systems but
 
05:39:57.788 --> 05:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
including cess pools ouses and
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
latrines they would do this by
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
advocating for connection to the sunap
 
05:40:06.590 --> 05:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
sewage treatment facility I am happy to
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
say that the association's efforts were
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
successful and all dwellings are now
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
connected as you hear from a number of
 
05:40:18.948 --> 05:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
residents from around the pond about the
 
05:40:22.468 --> 05:40:22.478 align:start position:0%
years of hard work to achieve their goal
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
of protecting the pond as well as the
 
05:40:28.708 --> 05:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
cost to the pond home homeowners to
 
05:40:28.718 --> 05:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
cost to the pond home homeowners to
install

05:40:29.910 --> 05:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
install
 
05:40:33.110 --> 05:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
their their sewage lines and the sonop
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who agreed to pay for the
 
05:40:39.510 --> 05:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
lengthy connection you might understand
 
05:40:43.390 --> 05:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
the shock when a makeshift houseboat
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
appeared at a dock occupied by a person
 
05:40:50.430 --> 05:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically encouraging others via
 
05:40:54.390 --> 05:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
social media to do the same with all its
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
implicit threats of
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
contamination from sewage and Gra water
 
05:41:04.030 --> 05:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
a floating septic system on Perkins Pond
 
05:41:07.390 --> 05:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
is truly a bad idea I hope you will
 
05:41:11.708 --> 05:41:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:19.868 --> 05:41:19.878 align:start position:0%

Perkins Pond is a 157 acre Shallow Lake
 
05:43:36.548 --> 05:43:36.558 align:start position:0%
located in the town of snipe in Sullivan
 
05:43:42.190 --> 05:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
deep rather you look at that than look
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
at me no that
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
works um this is an aerial photograph of
 
05:43:52.628 --> 05:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
the pond showing the approximate
 
05:43:54.830 --> 05:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
location of where the houseboat was
 
05:43:57.030 --> 05:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
found and has been there for the last
 
05:43:57.040 --> 05:43:57.990 align:start position:0%
found and has been there for the last
two

05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:44:00.590 --> 05:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
years due to the small size and depth
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
we're a very fragile body of water but
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
we like to think of our community as
 
05:44:07.750 --> 05:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
Tiny But Mighty the Perkins Pond
 
05:44:09.868 --> 05:44:09.878 align:start position:0%
protective Association has been actively
 
05:44:11.990 --> 05:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring Perkins Pond and its
 
05:44:15.030 --> 05:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
Watershed since 1987 through the New
 
05:44:16.750 --> 05:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire volunteer Lake Assessment
 
05:44:19.670 --> 05:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
program you probably know them as
 
05:44:22.270 --> 05:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
VAP we were one of the first Lakes to
 
05:44:24.670 --> 05:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
participate in the testing program to be
 
05:44:27.030 --> 05:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
able to monitor small changes and
 
05:44:29.788 --> 05:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
quickly mitigate when needed
 
05:44:31.788 --> 05:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
as Perkins Pond resident Attorney
 
05:44:35.110 --> 05:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
Richard jaffy was the founding Godfather
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Lakes Association
 
05:44:39.510 --> 05:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
Lake monitoring was very important to
 
05:44:42.070 --> 05:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
this little fragile B of body of
 
05:44:44.708 --> 05:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
water as a community we were concerned
 
05:44:47.190 --> 05:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
about the health of our water body and
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
as most of you know there are three
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
classifications of water body based on
 
05:44:53.948 --> 05:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
the amount of biological activity that
 
05:44:57.468 --> 05:44:57.478 align:start position:0%
they sustain the first is oligotrophic
 
05:44:59.708 --> 05:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
which means you have good water quality
 
05:45:02.670 --> 05:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
the second is mesotropic which is fair
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
and the worst is UT you utopic which
 
05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
means poor water quality in 1986 Perkins
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
Pond had good water quality and was
 
05:45:16.510 --> 05:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
classified as oligotrophic but in 2003
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
it was downgraded to Fair also known as
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
mesotropic this is a
 
05:45:22.638 --> 05:45:24.548 align:start position:0%
mesotropic this is a
picture

05:45:24.548 --> 05:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
picture
 
05:45:27.110 --> 05:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
coincidentally of a cyano factor
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
outbreak that we had in 2009 and we have
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
had a number of them
 
05:45:36.548 --> 05:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
since our small P shallow Pond heats up
 
05:45:38.868 --> 05:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
very very quickly in the summer and
 
05:45:42.310 --> 05:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
these outbreaks can very very quickly
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
appear part of the New Hampshire
 
05:45:46.270 --> 05:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
volunteer Lake Assessment program is
 
05:45:48.468 --> 05:45:48.478 align:start position:0%
that we collect to data during the
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
summer and the summer months that is
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed by experts and a report card
 
05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
table is created for the community now
 
05:45:59.670 --> 05:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
this is the report card table
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the most recent report card table
 
05:46:04.990 --> 05:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
for Perkins Pond and this is obviously
 
05:46:07.990 --> 05:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
available online and you can see that
 
05:46:13.868 --> 05:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:15.868 --> 05:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
struggling if you can see these pictures
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
or I should pass them around I'm not
 
05:46:22.150 --> 05:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.390 --> 05:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
protocols as an older community we were
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that the older cottages and
 
05:46:29.110 --> 05:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
older septic systems might might be
 
05:46:31.548 --> 05:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
contributing phosphorus causing exensive
 
05:46:33.788 --> 05:46:33.798 align:start position:0%
excessive plant growth and algae growth
 
05:46:36.750 --> 05:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
and the shift in Tropic status in the
 
05:46:39.990 --> 05:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
1990s more than 20 years ago the Perkins
 
05:46:42.270 --> 05:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
Pond Community initiated discussions
 
05:46:44.590 --> 05:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
with the town of cipe to install a sewer
 
05:46:46.468 --> 05:46:46.478 align:start position:0%
system to present another shift in
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
trophic status in other words we try to
 
05:46:51.510 --> 05:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
B limit biological growth that would
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
result in another
 
05:46:57.430 --> 05:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
downgrade after four failed votes to
 
05:46:59.788 --> 05:46:59.798 align:start position:0%
have a sewer bill passed
 
05:47:03.390 --> 05:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
one by missing one vote we decided to
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
contact the New Hampshire de in request
 
05:47:07.990 --> 05:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
a very expensive and timec consuming
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
diagnostic study of the pond to gather
 
05:47:13.110 --> 05:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
more information for the next vote and
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's the document that that that
 
05:47:17.830 --> 05:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative goling was talking
 
05:47:20.708 --> 05:47:20.718 align:start position:0%
about the conclusion of the study
 
05:47:22.750 --> 05:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
indicated that a sewer system around the
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
pond would remove septic system
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
phosphorus and have a significant
 
05:47:28.830 --> 05:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
benefit in maintaining Lake water
 
05:47:30.628 --> 05:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
quality over the long
 
05:47:33.430 --> 05:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
term the Perkins Pond Community spent
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
over 20 years lobbying for a sewer
 
05:47:38.670 --> 05:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
system and in 2019 with the help of the
 
05:47:41.230 --> 05:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
town of cipe and representative goling
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
we were able to install a a greater than
 
05:47:48.990 --> 05:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
$3 million sewer system to help mitigate
 
05:47:49.000 --> 05:47:50.310 align:start position:0%
$3 million sewer system to help mitigate
septic

05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
septic
 
05:47:53.030 --> 05:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
waste the residents of Perkins pond have
 
05:47:55.628 --> 05:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
worked tirelessly to keep the pond clean
 
05:47:57.510 --> 05:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
including investing hundreds of hours
 
05:47:59.590 --> 05:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
and thousands of dollars to have a sewer
 
05:48:02.990 --> 05:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
system installed to protect our asset so
 
05:48:05.788 --> 05:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
you can imagine our horror and surprise
 
05:48:08.190 --> 05:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
when a makeshift houseboat with five
 
05:48:09.910 --> 05:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
gallon plastic buckets for waste
 
05:48:12.350 --> 05:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
collection and Disposal was able to
 
05:48:14.948 --> 05:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
attach to a dock owned by an outof State
 
05:48:17.948 --> 05:48:17.958 align:start position:0%
person and stay for two
 
05:48:21.230 --> 05:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
years ly Arnold one of my colleagues
 
05:48:24.390 --> 05:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
will speak to you next but do you have
 
05:48:24.400 --> 05:48:27.110 align:start position:0%
will speak to you next but do you have
any

05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.230 --> 05:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
questions any questions
 
05:48:31.948 --> 05:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
questions by members of the
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none if do we excuse
 
05:48:41.190 --> 05:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
me Kelly oh I no I thought thought I saw
 
05:48:43.708 --> 05:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
your hand up if possible I would like to
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
leave this document with with the chair
 
05:48:49.230 --> 05:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
with with you Mr chairman in it you will
 
05:48:52.948 --> 05:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
find um just about 50 letters of support
 
05:48:55.190 --> 05:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the project from the residents of
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
Perkins Pond as well as um some of the
 
05:49:01.350 --> 05:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
materials that we we've shown you here
 
05:49:03.430 --> 05:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay we uh we could take them we can
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
leave them in the office and uh
 
05:49:08.788 --> 05:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
representative goling will return them
 
05:49:11.548 --> 05:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
to you okay also in the back of this was
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
a wonderful article that the eagle times
 
05:49:16.670 --> 05:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
did on Perkin Pond and this house bill
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
that was just published
 
05:49:21.910 --> 05:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday thank you thank you you
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative goling
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
05:49:29.628 --> 05:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
when when she she going to leave those
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
with the committee uh for short period
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
of time and we put it in your your uh
 
05:49:41.030 --> 05:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
your F in your office your little in
 
05:49:43.708 --> 05:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
your office your drawer your drawer in
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:53.350 --> 05:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
them well you're Mo every rep now has
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
has a it's like a filing
 
05:50:00.350 --> 05:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
cab that has a fairly large fairly
 
05:50:03.788 --> 05:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
shallow drawer and that and that's our
 
05:50:05.750 --> 05:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
office but then again what do you expect
 
05:50:08.230 --> 05:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
for $100 a year
 
05:50:12.110 --> 05:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you all very much
 
05:50:13.990 --> 05:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much this is very
 
05:50:16.190 --> 05:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
important to the the the residents of
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
Perkins Pond you know being only nine
 
05:50:22.230 --> 05:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
feet deep were we always worry about
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
contributions of biological waste and
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
this was this was such a surprise to us
 
05:50:29.350 --> 05:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't a law in the state of
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that would protect
 
05:50:34.868 --> 05:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
us let's follow with no being no no
 
05:50:37.948 --> 05:50:37.958 align:start position:0%
additional questions uh we'll we'll move
 
05:50:45.190 --> 05:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:48.310 --> 05:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
Arnold the floor is yours thank you uh
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairperson and
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
committee members H thank you for
 
05:50:53.788 --> 05:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak today about House
 
05:50:56.868 --> 05:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 1220 my name is Lynn Arnold and I
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
live on Perkins pond in sunap and I'm
 
05:51:00.390 --> 05:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
here today to ask you to support this
 
05:51:02.830 --> 05:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
house build we moved here three years
 
05:51:05.110 --> 05:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
ago from another small Lake in another
 
05:51:07.230 --> 05:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
small town in Massachusetts where I
 
05:51:09.390 --> 05:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
chaired the select board I um chaired
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
the planning board and I actually
 
05:51:13.230 --> 05:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
started and then shared a lake oversight
 
05:51:15.468 --> 05:51:15.478 align:start position:0%
committee uh we chose this beautiful
 
05:51:18.150 --> 05:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
pond in centipede to move to in large
 
05:51:20.548 --> 05:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
part because of the Town sewers and the
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
work of the Perkins Pond protective
 
05:51:24.910 --> 05:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
Association in keeping this Pond clean
 
05:51:27.190 --> 05:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
having had experience in other ponds
 
05:51:28.430 --> 05:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
that was something we were looking for
 
05:51:31.310 --> 05:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
and found here um you can imagine my
 
05:51:34.628 --> 05:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
surprise on May 19th two years ago when
 
05:51:36.750 --> 05:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh two summers ago actually um when I
 
05:51:39.510 --> 05:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
saw a large strip down pontoon boat
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
blocking our boat ramp and then later on
 
05:51:45.868 --> 05:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
it had moved to a dock of my neighbor
 
05:51:48.270 --> 05:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
right down the street this boat owner
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
asked others to use their docks and was
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
told no so finally the boat owner
 
05:51:53.788 --> 05:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
convinced an outer State homeowner who
 
05:51:56.070 --> 05:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
has rental property on our pond to rent
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
her dock space when the pond boat moved
 
05:52:01.948 --> 05:52:01.958 align:start position:0%
to its new home the boat owner erected a
 
05:52:04.230 --> 05:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
tent and that was where she lived that
 
05:52:06.910 --> 05:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
summer and then again last summer so we
 
05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
brought you a picture so that you could
 
05:52:11.070 --> 05:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
see it really is a stripped down pontoon
 
05:52:13.670 --> 05:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
boat with a tent on it and she lived
 
05:52:15.788 --> 05:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
there for the summer and then again last
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
summer the boat is currently parked in
 
05:52:22.670 --> 05:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
the driveway of the property where she
 
05:52:27.310 --> 05:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
was docked so we expect this to continue
 
05:52:30.150 --> 05:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
um new Hampshire Dees Marine Patrol was
 
05:52:31.990 --> 05:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
called and our Board of Health was
 
05:52:33.948 --> 05:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
called they visited her and she
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
explained that she was using two five
 
05:52:39.750 --> 05:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
gallon pales for her waste in her gray
 
05:52:41.830 --> 05:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
water and she told them that she would
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
be dumping these five gallon pales in um
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
the facilities that were at sunap
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
Harbor because of covid those facilities
 
05:52:53.070 --> 05:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
were closed that entire
 
05:52:56.468 --> 05:52:56.478 align:start position:0%
season yep and so where did all of her
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
Wastewater go and where did where did
 
05:53:02.110 --> 05:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
she shower and um what else went in our
 
05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
pond so um oh also Perkins Pond has no
 
05:53:07.990 --> 05:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
restroom and it has no dumping
 
05:53:10.270 --> 05:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
facilities to make matters worse this
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
Boat Boat owner has an active social
 
05:53:14.590 --> 05:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
media presence and once she was docked
 
05:53:16.110 --> 05:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
she advocated for others to bring their
 
05:53:18.430 --> 05:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
boats to our beautiful pond so just a
 
05:53:20.910 --> 05:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
few days after that I watched a large
 
05:53:23.070 --> 05:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
boat with sleeping facilities trying to
 
05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
launch thankfully they were unable to do
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
so because uh of the very low water
 
05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
level at the time at our boat ramp so um
 
05:53:33.190 --> 05:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
this is actually bigger than the
 
05:53:34.628 --> 05:53:34.638 align:start position:0%
homeowners of Perkins Pond you're going
 
05:53:36.948 --> 05:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
to hear from us today but um there is a
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
state boat launch on the pond which is
 
05:53:40.190 --> 05:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
used year round by
 
05:53:42.110 --> 05:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
non-residents these people come they
 
05:53:43.628 --> 05:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
fish they put in their fishing boats
 
05:53:46.948 --> 05:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
they kayak they canoe um they bring
 
05:53:49.390 --> 05:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
their kids to swim there uh this is
 
05:53:52.270 --> 05:53:52.280 align:start position:0%
their resource also biological waste
 
05:53:54.190 --> 05:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
contributed by a house boat like this or
 
05:53:56.948 --> 05:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
any other house boats can as you've
 
05:53:58.948 --> 05:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
heard in Willl her can cause degradation
 
05:54:01.708 --> 05:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
of our water quality and harm our pond
 
05:54:04.230 --> 05:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to ask you to support
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
all of us in protecting our vulnerable
 
05:54:08.750 --> 05:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
resource by voting to pass House Bill
 
05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
1220 and which would prohibit House Bill
 
05:54:12.030 --> 05:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
L Perkins
 
05:54:16.190 --> 05:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:19.990 --> 05:54:20.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman ma'am the same
 
05:54:24.510 --> 05:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
question is before what kind of support
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
from the community is it 100% is it 84
 
05:54:31.670 --> 05:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
.3% what of the of the 100 houses around
 
05:54:34.430 --> 05:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
Perkins Pond how how many have signed up
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
to this legislation so we have um we're
 
05:54:38.948 --> 05:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
going to leave that book with you we
 
05:54:42.110 --> 05:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
have letters from at least 40 of them um
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
we voted twice what you'll hear um as
 
05:54:47.310 --> 05:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
the protective Association to um support
 
05:54:50.030 --> 05:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
this unanimously so I don't have a
 
05:54:54.310 --> 05:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
um any other any other
 
05:54:57.000 --> 05:55:00.628 align:start position:0%
um any other any other
questions

05:55:00.628 --> 05:55:00.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:00.638 --> 05:55:02.190 align:start position:0%
 
Huff

05:55:02.190 --> 05:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
Huff
 
05:55:06.030 --> 05:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:55:08.350 --> 05:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know much about this so bear
 
05:55:12.670 --> 05:55:12.680 align:start position:0%
with me um it sounds to me that you're
 
05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
not so much opposed to the house booat
 
05:55:18.030 --> 05:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
as it is dumping waste into into the
 
05:55:18.040 --> 05:55:19.548 align:start position:0%
as it is dumping waste into into the
pond

05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
pond
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing anywhere that says
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:29.390 --> 05:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
think just I'm just asking there there's
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
no statute there's no you just can't
 
05:55:34.110 --> 05:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
dump I mean you have to have septic
 
05:55:36.708 --> 05:55:36.718 align:start position:0%
systems if you live around the lake
 
05:55:38.390 --> 05:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
because you can't dump it in the lake so
 
05:55:40.350 --> 05:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
I would assume that that would hold true
 
05:55:42.230 --> 05:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:55:44.788 --> 05:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
no like like I mentioned we have we have
 
05:55:47.230 --> 05:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
a state boat launch but there are no
 
05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
restrooms at that launch and there is no
 
05:55:53.190 --> 05:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
dumping facility anywhere near our
 
05:55:56.270 --> 05:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
pond thank
 
05:55:58.830 --> 05:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:56:00.670 --> 05:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so my question
 
05:56:02.670 --> 05:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
is do we have any sense of why this
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
resident person on the MAA boat CHS
 
05:56:08.788 --> 05:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
Perkins Bond um she's familiar with it
 
05:56:11.230 --> 05:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
because she has relatives who have a
 
05:56:14.628 --> 05:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
house a home or property I'm not sure
 
05:56:16.948 --> 05:56:16.958 align:start position:0%

comment on house House Bill 1220 which
 
05:57:01.270 --> 05:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
if passed will prohibit the docking of
 
05:57:03.350 --> 05:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
house boats on Perkins Pond and cipe I
 
05:57:05.548 --> 05:57:05.558 align:start position:0%

05:57:07.590 --> 05:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Union leader way back
 
05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
November 13th of 1979 began as follows a
 
05:57:12.670 --> 05:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
gathering of persons concerned with the
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
survival of New Hampshire's Lakes
 
05:57:15.868 --> 05:57:15.878 align:start position:0%
approved in concept Saturday the
 
05:57:17.910 --> 05:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
creation of a Statewide organization to
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
provide cloud in solving Lake management
 
05:57:22.110 --> 05:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
problems and a ninepoint program to
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
bring that clout to Bear meeting at the
 
05:57:26.190 --> 05:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
SOP Junior Senior High School in what
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
may be the state's first Lakes conf
 
05:57:29.948 --> 05:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
conference about 75 representatives of
 
05:57:31.590 --> 05:57:31.600 align:start position:0%

boards and conservation commissions
 
05:57:34.990 --> 05:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
heard presentations from State and
 
05:57:37.070 --> 05:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
private authorities on Lake management
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
at the end of that 1979 conference in
 
05:57:41.390 --> 05:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
sunap the representatives in attendance
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
unanimously voted to take the first step
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
in creating what eventually became the
 
05:57:47.510 --> 05:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes Association it was
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
my great honor at the time to have been
 
05:57:50.390 --> 05:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
elected chair of the conference in its
 
05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
subsequent steering committee however I
 
05:57:54.310 --> 05:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
do not write you today on the collective
 
05:57:55.750 --> 05:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of all the beautiful bodies of
 
05:57:58.070 --> 05:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
water that bless our entire state in all
 
05:58:00.910 --> 05:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
cander I confess I confess that my goal
 
05:58:02.868 --> 05:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
today is somewhat selfishly to elicit
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
your support for the reasonable
 
05:58:06.468 --> 05:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
protection of that one small pond that
 
05:58:08.030 --> 05:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
my wife and I fell in love with almost
 
05:58:10.430 --> 05:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
50 years ago I know you have received
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
materials from my neighbors and others
 
05:58:14.788 --> 05:58:14.798 align:start position:0%
um other concerned 1220 supporters
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the long battle to bring Town
 
05:58:18.910 --> 05:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
sewers to Perkin Pond the continuing
 
05:58:20.948 --> 05:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
fragile nature of the pond the absence
 
05:58:23.230 --> 05:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
of public restrooms and the present
 
05:58:24.788 --> 05:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
threat posed by house boats on this
 
05:58:27.070 --> 05:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
small body of water as such I'm going to
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
limit this letter to reminder in a brief
 
05:58:31.510 --> 05:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
summary of some Salient facts oh I
 
05:58:34.948 --> 05:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
didn't know you had two pages well I'm
 
05:58:36.708 --> 05:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
sorry one and a
 
05:58:40.070 --> 05:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
half yeah what else um house boats are
 
05:58:42.070 --> 05:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
currently prohibited on swam Conway and
 
05:58:45.788 --> 05:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
Silver Lakes um and all of I'll I'll
 
05:58:48.190 --> 05:58:48.200 align:start position:0%
I'll paraphrase all of those Lakes are
 
05:58:51.270 --> 05:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
larger and deeper than our pond um the
 
05:58:53.750 --> 05:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
current trophic C uh classification of
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
Perkins Pond is mesotrophic and simply
 
05:58:58.150 --> 05:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
put the pond is officially fragile so I
 
05:59:00.030 --> 05:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just posing one question is it
 
05:59:01.788 --> 05:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
not both reasonable and advisable to
 
05:59:03.468 --> 05:59:03.478 align:start position:0%
extend the same protection to the small
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
shallow fragile Perkins Pond that is
 
05:59:07.070 --> 05:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
already afforded the three larger and
 
05:59:09.628 --> 05:59:09.638 align:start position:0%
deeper bodies of water named above on my
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of my wife and myself and all
 
05:59:13.070 --> 05:59:13.080 align:start position:0%

of CTI has experienced in increased
 
05:59:59.830 --> 05:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
growth and construction of properties
 
06:00:02.070 --> 06:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
during the past two years property
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
values have increased creating new tax
 
06:00:06.510 --> 06:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
revenue for our town after having just
 
06:00:08.548 --> 06:00:08.558 align:start position:0%
gone through the tax rate setting and
 
06:00:10.430 --> 06:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
the budget I can tell you how important
 
06:00:12.190 --> 06:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
that revenue is to us and to the
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
stewards of um the community members of
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
sen and the impact the negative impact
 
06:00:23.070 --> 06:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
of these kinds of house boats on Perkins
 
06:00:26.030 --> 06:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
ponds impacts the dollar value of the
 
06:00:28.868 --> 06:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
homes um and that as you will know
 
06:00:31.030 --> 06:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
dramatically impacts our
 
06:00:35.350 --> 06:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
tax rate um the TA the The increased
 
06:00:37.110 --> 06:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
values of the property construction and
 
06:00:39.030 --> 06:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
added tax revenue support our town the
 
06:00:41.030 --> 06:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
bodies of water within the town of ctie
 
06:00:42.390 --> 06:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
are some of the most important and
 
06:00:44.830 --> 06:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
valuable assets that we have the town is

witness thank you man for taking my
 
06:02:20.948 --> 06:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
question congratulations on your
 
06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
position you're the perfect person I
 
06:02:25.670 --> 06:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
want to ask this question to um what
 
06:02:27.868 --> 06:02:27.878 align:start position:0%
type of zoning law
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
in town have existed or don't exist or
 
06:02:35.150 --> 06:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
could be enacted to help preclude this
 
06:02:36.910 --> 06:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
from occurring and therefore not having
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
to be a legislative issue but a Town
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
rules issue I feel like you just gave me
 
06:02:44.510 --> 06:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
the winning lottery ticket to redeem
 
06:02:46.510 --> 06:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
myself I stumbled a little bit on um the
 
06:02:50.990 --> 06:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
text here so um we together as a town
 
06:02:54.430 --> 06:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
have just put into our budget and if it
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
passes at the March 8th town meeting we
 
06:03:01.110 --> 06:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
will be hiring a full-time um code
 
06:03:03.990 --> 06:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
officer and an ordinance officer and
 
06:03:06.030 --> 06:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
that would afford US the ability to be
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
able to better monitor not only Perkins
 
06:03:10.830 --> 06:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
Pond but all of our bodies of water our
 
06:03:13.350 --> 06:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
Watershed and Rit large um and this is
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
hugely important not just for Perkins
 
06:03:18.628 --> 06:03:18.638 align:start position:0%
Pond um but there are a number of other
 
06:03:20.110 --> 06:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
violations that are happening that are
 
06:03:22.190 --> 06:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing Lake cenpy and again as I
 
06:03:23.708 --> 06:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
was just trying to talk about the dollar
 
06:03:26.590 --> 06:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
values of our homes it if we lose the
 
06:03:28.990 --> 06:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
lake we lose lose almost everything and
 
06:03:30.990 --> 06:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's the same for Perkins Pond if we
 
06:03:34.270 --> 06:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
lose Perkins Pond we dramatically lose
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
um that whole Community um as a tax
 
06:03:39.270 --> 06:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
contribut so what we are doing is we are
 
06:03:40.708 --> 06:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
putting in place a structure that would
 
06:03:43.910 --> 06:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
allow that um I would say that we are
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
going through a growth process with me
 
06:03:47.468 --> 06:03:47.478 align:start position:0%
at the helm we do not have as many
 
06:03:49.190 --> 06:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
strong ordinances as you might imagine a
 
06:03:50.910 --> 06:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
town like us would have but given that
 
06:03:53.390 --> 06:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
we have those large bodies of water
 
06:03:55.990 --> 06:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
however we are seeing an increased
 
06:03:57.830 --> 06:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
demand for us to have those in place and
 
06:03:59.430 --> 06:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
there are about 12 different stakeholder
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
groups aside from the Perkins Pond
 
06:04:03.310 --> 06:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
Association that are advocating for us
 
06:04:05.628 --> 06:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
to do the same thing to have this code
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
officer in place so that we're better
 
06:04:10.510 --> 06:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
putting in um we're better monitoring
 
06:04:13.110 --> 06:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
but we also have stricter uh guidance on
 
06:04:15.750 --> 06:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
the books that would allow us to fortify
 
06:04:19.868 --> 06:04:19.878 align:start position:0%
how we are uh protecting our bodies of
 
06:04:23.230 --> 06:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
water all right representative post you
 
06:04:27.468 --> 06:04:27.478 align:start position:0%
had a question uh or query of Captain
 
06:04:27.478 --> 06:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
had a question uh or query of Captain
done

06:04:28.390 --> 06:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:04:32.510 --> 06:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
one yes um my thought was that the
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
problem is not really the house boat the
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
problem is The Dumping of the
 
06:04:38.990 --> 06:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
sewage is there anything on the books
 
06:04:41.910 --> 06:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
about people dumping sewage in legs that
 
06:04:48.788 --> 06:04:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.670 --> 06:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
folks could I just say that the
 
06:04:52.430 --> 06:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
ordinance we do have an ordinance that
 
06:04:54.430 --> 06:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
would would not actually allow that
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
because the pond is not zoned for
 
06:04:59.510 --> 06:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
that living quarters to be there and as
 
06:05:02.310 --> 06:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
a result it is actually um not in
 
06:05:04.468 --> 06:05:04.478 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Zord ordinances of
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
Perkins Pond or like the those specific
 
06:05:09.030 --> 06:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
residential zones around Perkins pond so
 
06:05:10.390 --> 06:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
the house boat itself is not in
 
06:05:13.868 --> 06:05:13.878 align:start position:0%
compliance and our new code officer um a
 
06:05:16.230 --> 06:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
building inspector would be able to
 
06:05:18.548 --> 06:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
enforce that um I think this just gives
 
06:05:21.190 --> 06:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
us more top cover as well as helps us to
 
06:05:24.110 --> 06:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
put in place stronger um means as we
 
06:05:25.990 --> 06:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
continue to grow not only send for
 
06:05:28.390 --> 06:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
Perkins Pond but the the larger Lake
 
06:05:35.468 --> 06:05:35.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:38.468 --> 06:05:38.478 align:start position:0%
that chairman rulu my name is Tim Dunley
 
06:05:39.548 --> 06:05:39.558 align:start position:0%
I'm the captain of the New Hampshire
 
06:05:41.910 --> 06:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol unit for the division of
 
06:05:44.430 --> 06:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
State Police and I want to thank you and
 
06:05:45.910 --> 06:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
The Honorable members of the committee
 
06:05:47.310 --> 06:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to answer some questions
 
06:05:50.468 --> 06:05:50.478 align:start position:0%
for representative post I can tell you
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
that just in listening to this um there
 
06:05:57.070 --> 06:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
are statutes uh in the dees section of
 
06:05:59.750 --> 06:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
of our laws that prohibit the dumpage of
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
sewage into our public Waters uh the the
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
statutes Define clearly a house Boo and
 
06:06:08.590 --> 06:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
what that is and it is a very general
 
06:06:11.110 --> 06:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
term that applies to any type of craft
 
06:06:14.110 --> 06:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
platform or anything that has sleeping
 
06:06:16.628 --> 06:06:16.638 align:start position:0%
or toilet facilities whether those are
 
06:06:20.190 --> 06:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
formal facilities or temporary in nature
 
06:06:22.190 --> 06:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
and in the past quite frankly a 5 gallon
 
06:06:24.150 --> 06:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
bucket has been ruled a toilet facility
 
06:06:27.510 --> 06:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
on a boat uh from a perspective of
 
06:06:30.788 --> 06:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
what's been discussed uh for for local
 
06:06:32.750 --> 06:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
authorities to regulate this I will I
 
06:06:35.350 --> 06:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
will just not being a legal mind but I
 
06:06:37.990 --> 06:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we have circumstances
 
06:06:40.310 --> 06:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
where there are commercial operations on
 
06:06:43.590 --> 06:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
our Lakes uh that are taking place uh in
 
06:06:46.670 --> 06:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
areas where zoning on Shore are
 
06:06:48.750 --> 06:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
residential only and because this is
 
06:06:50.510 --> 06:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking place on the public Waters being
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
held in in trust for all of us uh those
 
06:06:56.590 --> 06:06:56.600 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations do not apply when
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
something is happening on the water just
 
06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
food for thought um but we do have
 
06:07:03.110 --> 06:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
bodies of water that do restrict
 
06:07:05.350 --> 06:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
houseboats and houseboats if it's a
 
06:07:07.830 --> 06:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
house boat it's clearly because it has
 
06:07:10.510 --> 06:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of sleeping whether temporary
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
or not uh accommodations as well as uh
 
06:07:18.270 --> 06:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
toilet facilities uh Dees has the
 
06:07:21.788 --> 06:07:21.798 align:start position:0%
authority to to inspect those facilities
 
06:07:24.468 --> 06:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
and the land owner by Statute right now
 
06:07:27.830 --> 06:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
who is renting a dock or or host hting a
 
06:07:30.590 --> 06:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
house boat for an overnight period must
 
06:07:33.628 --> 06:07:33.638 align:start position:0%
maintain logs report to Dees when this
 
06:07:35.830 --> 06:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
activity is going on and and the
 
06:07:37.670 --> 06:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
oversight for this activity would be
 
06:07:37.680 --> 06:07:38.830 align:start position:0%
oversight for this activity would be
through

06:07:38.830 --> 06:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
DS happy to answer any more questions
 
06:07:44.190 --> 06:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
than we have thank you very much for
 
06:07:46.468 --> 06:07:46.478 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
Mayville sorry it does not prohibit a
 
06:07:51.390 --> 06:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
house boat from being on that body of
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
water as long as you know the the box is
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
a check for the the person that V on
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:08.548 --> 06:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
chair there we go okay so just a I
 
06:08:09.990 --> 06:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed that statute as well it was
 
06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
2782 and it re related to overnight Ming
 
06:08:16.150 --> 06:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
of house boats correct um now I'm I'm
 
06:08:19.070 --> 06:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
and I my understanding is that this is a
 
06:08:20.830 --> 06:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
public body of water am I correct
 
06:08:23.468 --> 06:08:23.478 align:start position:0%
because it is 100 acres that is
 
06:08:27.310 --> 06:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
correct now I'm wondering if um we do
 
06:08:28.350 --> 06:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
have the you know the bill coming
 
06:08:30.150 --> 06:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
forward but I'm wondering if that area
 
06:08:32.468 --> 06:08:32.478 align:start position:0%
can be better protected by designating
 
06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
that an NDA a no discharge area if or or
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
do we already have those statutes in law
 
06:08:40.150 --> 06:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
that prohibit the discharge of that
 
06:08:42.510 --> 06:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
where the homeowner who's renting that
 
06:08:46.310 --> 06:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
dock would be fined or somehow you know
 
06:08:48.628 --> 06:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
disciplined I I can't speak to what the
 
06:08:50.948 --> 06:08:50.958 align:start position:0%
dees all the dees statutes say about
 
06:08:53.150 --> 06:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
discharge but it's the person who's on
 
06:08:54.708 --> 06:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
board the boat that is caught
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
discharging that is held responsible for
 
06:09:00.030 --> 06:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
that violation every body water in our
 
06:09:01.990 --> 06:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
state is a no discharge Zone it is
 
06:09:04.590 --> 06:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
illegal for the boat to be capable of or
 
06:09:07.390 --> 06:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
for a person to discharge any gray or
 
06:09:09.548 --> 06:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
black water into our public waters on
 
06:09:09.558 --> 06:09:25.708 align:start position:0%
black water into our public waters on
the

06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%

06:10:04.350 --> 06:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
recognition of the small size shallow
 
06:10:06.468 --> 06:10:06.478 align:start position:0%

06:10:41.708 --> 06:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
this day forward passed
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
unanimously my home is on the same
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
street as the do where the makeshift
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
house boat has been for the past two
 
06:10:51.990 --> 06:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
summers and we've all noticed increased
 
06:10:54.468 --> 06:10:54.478 align:start position:0%
vegetative growth in the area where the
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
boat is we don't know what it where it's
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
coming from but it's a concern to all of
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
us and if I might add you know we've
 
06:11:06.590 --> 06:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's we all know that there are rules
 
06:11:10.190 --> 06:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
against dumping in the pawn but how do
 
06:11:12.468 --> 06:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
you ever catch someone that if she's
 
06:11:14.590 --> 06:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
doing in in the middle of the
 
06:11:17.468 --> 06:11:17.478 align:start position:0%
night you no one would ever know I mean
 
06:11:20.070 --> 06:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
she said she was going to the dumping
 
06:11:22.030 --> 06:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
facility and the dumping facility was
 
06:11:24.190 --> 06:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
closed so she did something with that
 
06:11:26.310 --> 06:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
waste whether she dug a hole in the
 
06:11:26.320 --> 06:11:27.708 align:start position:0%
waste whether she dug a hole in the
woods

06:11:27.708 --> 06:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
woods
 
06:11:30.628 --> 06:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
we don't know and that's what it's that
 
06:11:33.070 --> 06:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
unknown that is so concerning for all of
 
06:11:34.990 --> 06:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
us my husband and I are from
 
06:11:37.868 --> 06:11:37.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we moved up here we own
 
06:11:39.910 --> 06:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
the home for 20 years we moved up here
 
06:11:42.548 --> 06:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
permanently maybe two years this past
 
06:11:45.788 --> 06:11:45.798 align:start position:0%
May and my children have grown up here I
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
now have six grandchildren and my
 
06:11:50.948 --> 06:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
concern OB as all of the homeowners is
 
06:11:53.350 --> 06:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
that the water
 
06:11:56.110 --> 06:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
degreg you know what do we do we have to
 
06:11:58.070 --> 06:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
sell it can't use the kids can't go in
 
06:12:01.628 --> 06:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
the water it's just it's such a concern
 
06:12:04.030 --> 06:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's heartbreaking to
 
06:12:07.548 --> 06:12:07.558 align:start position:0%
watch thank you for your time and
 
06:12:10.270 --> 06:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
commitment to helping us keep our
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:19.628 --> 06:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
clean any questions representative Smith
 
06:12:21.430 --> 06:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
well I'm not sure if this is a question
 
06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
or a clarification but since any water
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
body of over 10 acres is inheld in the
 
06:12:29.948 --> 06:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
public trust for all the people of New
 
06:12:33.390 --> 06:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can an ordinance passed by
 
06:12:38.350 --> 06:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
sopy be actually legal that is telling a
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
certain kind of boat can't be on the
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
water I think that is I think that's a
 
06:12:47.670 --> 06:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
big issue regarding the ordinance
 
06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:55.360 --> 06:13:20.110 align:start position:0%
 
question

06:13:20.110 --> 06:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
okay see no other

donation program for operators of
 
06:27:31.590 --> 06:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
non-motorized boats and requiring the
 
06:27:33.548 --> 06:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
fishing game department to prepare a
 
06:27:36.150 --> 06:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
report relating to such
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
programs um I have put a amendment in
 
06:27:44.070 --> 06:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
front of each of you uh Amendment
 
06:27:44.080 --> 06:27:45.830 align:start position:0%
front of each of you uh Amendment
202200

06:27:45.830 --> 06:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
202200
 
06:27:48.510 --> 06:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
51h um what that Amendment does is it
 
06:27:50.030 --> 06:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
removes section one of the bill the
 
06:27:52.868 --> 06:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement uh in discussion
 
06:27:55.590 --> 06:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
with fish and game that information is
 
06:27:57.708 --> 06:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh already uh as public information
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
Avail will be available um they
 
06:28:01.390 --> 06:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
currently do that with the hike safegard
 
06:28:02.788 --> 06:28:02.798 align:start position:0%
and they would have no problem doing it
 
06:28:05.230 --> 06:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
with this program as well so they don't
 
06:28:06.948 --> 06:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
feel that the reporting requirement is
 
06:28:09.110 --> 06:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
necessary and I agree with them and took
 
06:28:09.120 --> 06:28:11.548 align:start position:0%
necessary and I agree with them and took
that

06:28:11.548 --> 06:28:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:16.270 --> 06:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
out and why am I here today this came
 
06:28:18.190 --> 06:28:18.200 align:start position:0%
this bill came about uh it's been a
 
06:28:22.948 --> 06:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.910 --> 06:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
um I shared a a commission to uh study
 
06:28:29.788 --> 06:28:29.798 align:start position:0%
the sustainability of fish and game
 
06:28:31.788 --> 06:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
department and one of the things that
 
06:28:33.868 --> 06:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
came out in the report
 
06:28:33.878 --> 06:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
came out in the report
was

06:28:35.750 --> 06:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:28:39.070 --> 06:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
um that boat access sites here in New
 
06:28:39.080 --> 06:28:40.548 align:start position:0%
um that boat access sites here in New
Hampshire

06:28:40.548 --> 06:28:40.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:28:44.510 --> 06:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
um were not being funded by all the
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
users of of the access sites um fishing
 
06:28:52.590 --> 06:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
game maintains all the sites um and out
 
06:28:54.628 --> 06:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
of the number of sites they maintain
 
06:28:57.110 --> 06:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
four 43% of those
 
06:29:00.868 --> 06:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
sites are available and used for cart
 
06:29:03.830 --> 06:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
top uh Vehicles only which would be
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
canoes and
 
06:29:08.110 --> 06:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
kayaks um and the way they F boat access
 
06:29:12.390 --> 06:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
fund is uh funded is $5 of every
 
06:29:14.910 --> 06:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
registration uh of a motorboat goes to
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
the boat access fund and there was no
 
06:29:20.830 --> 06:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
money going in from those folks in
 
06:29:23.628 --> 06:29:23.638 align:start position:0%
canoes or kayaks uh to help maintain
 
06:29:26.270 --> 06:29:26.280 align:start position:0%
those facilities
 
06:29:26.280 --> 06:29:27.628 align:start position:0%
those facilities
uh

06:29:27.628 --> 06:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:29:33.230 --> 06:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
so the report was written and uh I came
 
06:29:38.030 --> 06:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
back and uh submitted a bill back in
 
06:29:41.310 --> 06:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
2019 um that bill went to the fishing
 
06:29:44.310 --> 06:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
game committee and
 
06:29:48.788 --> 06:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh that bill that I put in mandated a
 
06:29:52.830 --> 06:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
$10 fee for anyone who used a access
 
06:29:56.708 --> 06:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
site um here in the state of New
 
06:29:59.510 --> 06:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um as you can imagine there
 
06:30:01.628 --> 06:30:01.638 align:start position:0%
was a number of folks that were opposed
 
06:30:03.948 --> 06:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
to that fee
 
06:30:07.390 --> 06:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
um and fishing game the committee
 
06:30:10.150 --> 06:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
retained the bill in 2019 after I put it
 
06:30:12.430 --> 06:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
in uh so that we could work on it and
 
06:30:14.110 --> 06:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the issues that were
 
06:30:15.868 --> 06:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
brought up in the public
 
06:30:18.310 --> 06:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
hearing um during that public hearing
 
06:30:20.510 --> 06:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
there were a number of individuals
 
06:30:23.910 --> 06:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
there who had testified that they'd be
 
06:30:25.468 --> 06:30:25.478 align:start position:0%
willing to voluntarily
 
06:30:29.548 --> 06:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
help support the access sites um knowing
 
06:30:32.150 --> 06:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
that it only creates a
 
06:30:35.030 --> 06:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
better site for them and also it can
 
06:30:37.468 --> 06:30:37.478 align:start position:0%
increase access to New Hampshire's water
 
06:30:39.430 --> 06:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
bodies for these individuals to get
 
06:30:42.830 --> 06:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
their canoes and kayaks out
 
06:30:45.548 --> 06:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
so when fishing game retained that bill
 
06:30:47.788 --> 06:30:47.798 align:start position:0%
we worked on it and we had discussions
 
06:30:50.788 --> 06:30:50.798 align:start position:0%
about how we could at least have a
 
06:30:52.468 --> 06:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
vehicle for those folks who testified
 
06:30:54.110 --> 06:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to donate and like to
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
participate and maintaining these access
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
sites um that currently aren't uh and
 
06:31:01.430 --> 06:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
one of the ideas that came out was well
 
06:31:03.350 --> 06:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
we do the hike safe card here in New
 
06:31:05.788 --> 06:31:05.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that goes to search and rescue
 
06:31:06.868 --> 06:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
06:31:06.878 --> 06:31:08.830 align:start position:0%
that is a
voluntary

06:31:08.830 --> 06:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
06:31:10.868 --> 06:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
card uh
 
06:31:13.830 --> 06:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
so the thought came out could we mirror
 
06:31:17.750 --> 06:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
that and have a voluntary way of
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
participating and helping with boat
 
06:31:21.670 --> 06:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
access here in New Hampshire uh for
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
those who want to take advantage of it
 
06:31:26.830 --> 06:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
that have Cano and kayaks um so we
 
06:31:28.350 --> 06:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
mirrored that and said that all the
 
06:31:30.830 --> 06:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
money generated would go directly to
 
06:31:34.708 --> 06:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
boat access through fishing game uh that
 
06:31:38.190 --> 06:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
bill in fishing game in 2000 in 2020
 
06:31:40.868 --> 06:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
after the retained it was amended to
 
06:31:42.830 --> 06:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
basically the same exact language that's
 
06:31:44.910 --> 06:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
in the build before you today that
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
passed the fishing game committee 14 to
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
nothing went to the house floor we
 
06:31:51.388 --> 06:31:51.398 align:start position:0%
passed it in the house on a Voice vote
 
06:31:55.548 --> 06:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
and we all know in 2020 Co came and the
 
06:31:58.270 --> 06:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
Senate put a number of bills into
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills and then tabled the rest
 
06:32:01.628 --> 06:32:01.638 align:start position:0%
of them this was one of the bills that
 
06:32:04.468 --> 06:32:04.478 align:start position:0%
get tabled so I'm back here today
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
bringing this back out hoping that we
 
06:32:08.548 --> 06:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
can have a vehicle for those folks who
 
06:32:10.350 --> 06:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
have canoes and kayaks and want to help
 
06:32:12.230 --> 06:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
participate in the funding and create
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
better access and maintain the access
 
06:32:17.110 --> 06:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
they have and also increase access to
 
06:32:18.670 --> 06:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
our public bodies of water here in in
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have that vehicle to do that
 
06:32:23.468 --> 06:32:23.478 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill is here today
 
06:32:25.750 --> 06:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
so I ask that you support that that and
 
06:32:27.150 --> 06:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
like I said the amendment before you was
 
06:32:29.750 --> 06:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
at request of fishing game to delete the
 
06:32:31.110 --> 06:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement and that's all
 
06:32:34.868 --> 06:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
that does and with that I will take any
 
06:32:37.628 --> 06:32:37.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh any
 
06:32:39.990 --> 06:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter
 
06:32:42.628 --> 06:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr chair
 
06:32:44.270 --> 06:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
06:32:49.310 --> 06:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
my question um I note here that um with
 
06:32:51.190 --> 06:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
the hike safe card there's a certain
 
06:32:53.110 --> 06:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
amount that you donate to get the hike
 
06:32:56.190 --> 06:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
safe card and I don't see any specific
 
06:32:58.708 --> 06:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
number it's just like someone can make a
 
06:33:00.948 --> 06:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
donation and then those who have
 
06:33:03.190 --> 06:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
contributed could get a sticker a card
 
06:33:06.270 --> 06:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
or a letter of thanks so it seems pretty
 
06:33:08.388 --> 06:33:08.398 align:start position:0%
vague I was I was thinking it was going
 
06:33:10.430 --> 06:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
to be more like the hike safe card where
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
you did have a you know like a $25 fee
 
06:33:16.590 --> 06:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
for the year or something like that if
 
06:33:20.350 --> 06:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
you decided to partake and and I I I
 
06:33:23.468 --> 06:33:23.478 align:start position:0%
left that open for a reason because I
 
06:33:25.310 --> 06:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
felt that fishing game could deal with
 
06:33:26.830 --> 06:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
that in their rules when they put this
 
06:33:30.548 --> 06:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
program together
 
06:33:35.388 --> 06:33:35.398 align:start position:0%
um it's fairly new it's to help out with
 
06:33:37.708 --> 06:33:37.718 align:start position:0%
the program uh I'm not sure what the
 
06:33:39.750 --> 06:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
cost will be to them for initial startup
 
06:33:41.670 --> 06:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
or what they may have for costs going
 
06:33:45.830 --> 06:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
forward um I I think by dealing with
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
access they have a better understanding
 
06:33:49.270 --> 06:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
what that fee would be and how they
 
06:33:52.070 --> 06:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
could help generate revenue for at boat
 
06:33:55.868 --> 06:33:55.878 align:start position:0%
access so I left that for that reason
 
06:33:55.878 --> 06:34:04.388 align:start position:0%
access so I left that for that reason
thank

06:34:04.388 --> 06:34:04.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:23.478 --> 06:34:53.388 align:start position:0%
 
committee

06:34:53.388 --> 06:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:58.070 --> 06:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
after with the Amendments that um
 
06:35:00.948 --> 06:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
representative uh goalie
 
06:35:03.070 --> 06:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned if I need to say that again
 
06:35:09.430 --> 06:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:13.070 --> 06:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
will so representative goalie made a
 
06:35:15.788 --> 06:35:15.798 align:start position:0%
good overview of what um this bill is
 
06:35:18.070 --> 06:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
about and and why it's
 
06:35:21.910 --> 06:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
important um I want to just provide some
 
06:35:23.590 --> 06:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
context for it and to answer any
 
06:35:26.468 --> 06:35:26.478 align:start position:0%
questions that may make it um more
 
06:35:29.190 --> 06:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
relevant to uh your perceptions of how
 
06:35:30.788 --> 06:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
this program
 
06:35:35.070 --> 06:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
runs just want to clarify a few details
 
06:35:37.230 --> 06:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
the program is has two funding
 
06:35:39.670 --> 06:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
mechanisms one is a state fund and the
 
06:35:42.788 --> 06:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
other is the sportfish restoration act
 
06:35:44.830 --> 06:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
which is federal
 
06:35:47.948 --> 06:35:47.958 align:start position:0%
dollars the every boat regist motorized
 
06:35:51.350 --> 06:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
boat um that registers in the state of
 
06:35:53.910 --> 06:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pays a Sur charge above
 
06:35:55.788 --> 06:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
their Reg registration fee of
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
$5 which comes to the department
 
06:36:01.830 --> 06:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
directly to be included in the Statewide
 
06:36:07.548 --> 06:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:12.190 --> 06:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
233a um no there's no sech charge or no
 
06:36:13.750 --> 06:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
registration requirement for
 
06:36:16.788 --> 06:36:16.798 align:start position:0%
non-motorized watercraft in the state so
 
06:36:18.670 --> 06:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
there's no opportunity for those people
 
06:36:21.990 --> 06:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
to contribute even if they wanted to
 
06:36:23.628 --> 06:36:23.638 align:start position:0%
where it would certainly be difficult
 
06:36:27.548 --> 06:36:27.558 align:start position:0%
you'd have to make a special um uh
 
06:36:30.190 --> 06:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
process for them to or or active
 
06:36:32.468 --> 06:36:32.478 align:start position:0%
activity to come to the department to do
 
06:36:35.948 --> 06:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
that the program does not receive any
 
06:36:38.788 --> 06:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
state budget money um it's
 
06:36:41.628 --> 06:36:41.638 align:start position:0%
self-funded we use the Statewide Public
 
06:36:45.628 --> 06:36:45.638 align:start position:0%
boat access fund the state funds to uh
 
06:36:48.030 --> 06:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
obtain Federal matching dollars at a
 
06:36:50.110 --> 06:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
ratio of one state dollar for three
 
06:36:52.388 --> 06:36:52.398 align:start position:0%
federal dollars so it's quite quite a
 
06:36:56.030 --> 06:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
good deal for us to have a larger State
 
06:37:00.270 --> 06:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
Fe um to maintain this this
 
06:37:03.990 --> 06:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
fund we have 135 boat access sites in
 
06:37:05.310 --> 06:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
the state that the fish and game
 
06:37:05.320 --> 06:37:06.628 align:start position:0%
the state that the fish and game
department

06:37:06.628 --> 06:37:06.638 align:start position:0%
department
 
06:37:10.830 --> 06:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
maintains on um only and there are
 
06:37:14.788 --> 06:37:14.798 align:start position:0%
97 great ponds in the state so there's a
 
06:37:16.628 --> 06:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
lot of lakes that we don't have access
 
06:37:19.868 --> 06:37:19.878 align:start position:0%
to at the moment um which would benefit
 
06:37:22.430 --> 06:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
the state by um you know trying to
 
06:37:26.548 --> 06:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
increase that number of those 135 sites
 
06:37:29.750 --> 06:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
as representative goalie mentioned uh 77
 
06:37:32.590 --> 06:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
are for trailered you uh Vehicles
 
06:37:36.030 --> 06:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
trailer boats and at those sites they
 
06:37:40.070 --> 06:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
are also totally available to
 
06:37:43.708 --> 06:37:43.718 align:start position:0%
um non-motorized watercraft so canoes
 
06:37:46.868 --> 06:37:46.878 align:start position:0%
kayaks P paddle boards and and the
 
06:37:51.190 --> 06:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
like uh the remaining 58 sites are only
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh capable of handling C top
 
06:37:57.350 --> 06:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
non-motorized um watercraft there's no
 
06:37:59.948 --> 06:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
ramp there's no way for well there are
 
06:38:01.590 --> 06:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
ramps but they're not they're not
 
06:38:04.750 --> 06:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
functional for for um trailered boats
 
06:38:07.030 --> 06:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to be uh able to
 
06:38:10.708 --> 06:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
launch one of those boats on a
 
06:38:15.468 --> 06:38:15.478 align:start position:0%
trailer um when I have spoken with
 
06:38:17.468 --> 06:38:17.478 align:start position:0%
kayakers and canoeists and so forth
 
06:38:20.070 --> 06:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
they've called in many of them think
 
06:38:22.628 --> 06:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
that their tax dollars to the general
 
06:38:24.628 --> 06:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
fund are supporting this progr
 
06:38:28.190 --> 06:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
program and so they are unaware that
 
06:38:29.948 --> 06:38:29.958 align:start position:0%
their contribut that they're not
 
06:38:31.948 --> 06:38:31.958 align:start position:0%
contributing to you know the benefit
 
06:38:34.708 --> 06:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
that they're receiving uh through this
 
06:38:37.628 --> 06:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
program and many of them once that that
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
gets explained to them are are quite
 
06:38:41.388 --> 06:38:41.398 align:start position:0%
willing to consider making you know
 
06:38:43.708 --> 06:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
trying to contribute and and supporting
 
06:38:46.670 --> 06:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
the the um the program but there's no
 
06:38:49.110 --> 06:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
mechanism for that at the moment so this
 
06:38:52.548 --> 06:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill would be very um beneficial for
 
06:38:54.510 --> 06:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
easing and and making it easy easier for
 
06:38:56.750 --> 06:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
people to contribute when they feel that
 
06:38:59.350 --> 06:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
they want to again it would be voluntary
 
06:39:01.948 --> 06:39:01.958 align:start position:0%
but I think that there's probably a lot
 
06:39:03.948 --> 06:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
of people out here once this would be
 
06:39:06.070 --> 06:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
advertised and and promoted around the
 
06:39:09.430 --> 06:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
state that would one uh educate them to
 
06:39:11.388 --> 06:39:11.398 align:start position:0%
the fact that their tax dollars don't
 
06:39:13.270 --> 06:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
pay for the program and and that would
 
06:39:17.948 --> 06:39:17.958 align:start position:0%
make many of them I think um feel um
 
06:39:19.670 --> 06:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
potentially compelled but certainly at
 
06:39:21.910 --> 06:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
least give some thought to making a
 
06:39:25.628 --> 06:39:25.638 align:start position:0%
donation um representative Smith asked
 
06:39:28.070 --> 06:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know that we didn't clarify how much
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
money we would ask for as a donation or
 
06:39:33.510 --> 06:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
at least specify it and um I can say
 
06:39:36.350 --> 06:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
that we would try and match it to the
 
06:39:38.910 --> 06:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
$25 fee for the hike safe card so that
 
06:39:41.270 --> 06:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're compatible to each other
 
06:39:43.310 --> 06:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
so that's probably where we would go
 
06:39:43.320 --> 06:39:44.788 align:start position:0%
so that's probably where we would go
with

06:39:44.788 --> 06:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:39:44.798 --> 06:39:47.270 align:start position:0%
with
that

06:39:47.270 --> 06:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:39:50.150 --> 06:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
um there are many lakes that don't have
 
06:39:52.750 --> 06:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
boat access of any kind at this at this
 
06:39:55.430 --> 06:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
moment I don't have the exact number I
 
06:39:57.430 --> 06:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
think it may be on the order of 200
 
06:40:00.868 --> 06:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps as high as 300 lakes that don't
 
06:40:03.510 --> 06:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
have access not all of them would be
 
06:40:05.670 --> 06:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have access some of them
 
06:40:08.388 --> 06:40:08.398 align:start position:0%
may be too small or too too remote to
 
06:40:10.110 --> 06:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
actually get there to make it cost
 
06:40:12.628 --> 06:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
effective there are many lakes of course
 
06:40:17.190 --> 06:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
out of we have 135 sites on 135 Lakes
 
06:40:19.548 --> 06:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
but there are many lakes also that are
 
06:40:23.468 --> 06:40:23.478 align:start position:0%
that are um accessible perhaps on Town
 
06:40:26.868 --> 06:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
ramps but those ramps are restricted in
 
06:40:29.270 --> 06:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
many cases to residential to the
 
06:40:31.468 --> 06:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
residents of the town that they're in so
 
06:40:33.590 --> 06:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
for the most part they're foreclose for
 
06:40:35.468 --> 06:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
most of the general
 
06:40:39.110 --> 06:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
public so this bill would add fairness
 
06:40:42.030 --> 06:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
to the program by allowing more people
 
06:40:44.750 --> 06:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be part of the program and and to
 
06:40:47.110 --> 06:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
contribute to it and in a larger
 
06:40:49.468 --> 06:40:49.478 align:start position:0%
framework it also I think would be an
 
06:40:52.948 --> 06:40:52.958 align:start position:0%
investment in the economics and and
 
06:40:55.788 --> 06:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
benefit uh the business businesses of
 
06:40:58.310 --> 06:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
the state in that boat access and
 
06:41:00.948 --> 06:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
boating is a major component of the
 
06:41:03.868 --> 06:41:03.878 align:start position:0%
tourism industry that we have in the
 
06:41:08.510 --> 06:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
state so it would have a a wider um
 
06:41:11.150 --> 06:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
benefit to all of the citizens in the
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
state by increasing um the um enjoyment
 
06:41:19.230 --> 06:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
of people coming to visit and therefore
 
06:41:21.670 --> 06:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
May attract more people over the last
 
06:41:24.510 --> 06:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
two years I've received many calls from
 
06:41:28.150 --> 06:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
people who are just very surprised and
 
06:41:32.070 --> 06:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
and annoyed that's one word um at the
 
06:41:34.110 --> 06:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
overcrowding that we're seeing at the
 
06:41:37.430 --> 06:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
boat ramps that exist now um just
 
06:41:40.150 --> 06:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
because everyone was told hey it's get
 
06:41:43.150 --> 06:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
outside you know recreate and that'll be
 
06:41:45.310 --> 06:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
a safe way to try and make your way
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
through this covid pandemic that we're
 
06:41:50.388 --> 06:41:50.398 align:start position:0%
suffering through at the moment but what
 
06:41:53.030 --> 06:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
that what that demonstrated was the fact
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we were very close if not Beyond
 
06:41:57.468 --> 06:41:57.478 align:start position:0%
The Tipping Point for having enough
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
access points to accommodate the tourist
 
06:42:02.388 --> 06:42:02.398 align:start position:0%
industry that we want to promote for the
 
06:42:05.230 --> 06:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
state so therefore if we can find a way
 
06:42:08.150 --> 06:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
to help fund having more access to our
 
06:42:10.190 --> 06:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
Lakes we're going to make the enjoint
 
06:42:12.310 --> 06:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
the the experience that people have both
 
06:42:14.548 --> 06:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
tourists and our own citizens more
 
06:42:16.590 --> 06:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
enjoyable and I think that's going to
 
06:42:19.070 --> 06:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
benefit um the businesses of the state
 
06:42:22.030 --> 06:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
and certainly the whole population in
 
06:42:25.510 --> 06:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
general so uh I think we need to think
 
06:42:27.670 --> 06:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
about this opportunity also in a broader
 
06:42:29.670 --> 06:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
in that broader
 
06:42:34.110 --> 06:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
context I just say one more thing our
 
06:42:36.830 --> 06:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
revenues and I gave a chart out there
 
06:42:40.150 --> 06:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
have been very stagnant very uh stable
 
06:42:41.750 --> 06:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years that I've been
 
06:42:45.670 --> 06:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
here and I want to point out that again
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
building on that tourism idea the last
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
time fishing game was able to buy a
 
06:42:51.708 --> 06:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
property was in
 
06:42:54.750 --> 06:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
2012 almost 10 years ago now when we
 
06:42:57.110 --> 06:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
bought the downings landing property in
 
06:42:59.190 --> 06:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
in Alton at the southern part of the bay
 
06:43:01.868 --> 06:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
which um by next spring will be our
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
first Public Access on lein aosaki and
 
06:43:07.350 --> 06:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's kind of surprising since this
 
06:43:10.190 --> 06:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
program's been here for 19 since 1993
 
06:43:11.830 --> 06:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
that it's taken that long to get onto
 
06:43:14.670 --> 06:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
Leu pasak but that's an example of how
 
06:43:17.310 --> 06:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
hard it is to find properties that when
 
06:43:19.948 --> 06:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
we can afford or or become
 
06:43:22.590 --> 06:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
available so I just want to point out
 
06:43:24.948 --> 06:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
that with without more funds it's going
 
06:43:29.468 --> 06:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
to be difficult to uh increase the
 
06:43:33.350 --> 06:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
number of boat access sites that we can
 
06:43:36.590 --> 06:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
um build or buy and then
 
06:43:39.628 --> 06:43:39.638 align:start position:0%
build and I will leave it at that for
 
06:43:41.150 --> 06:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
the moment and thank the chair and the
 
06:43:42.830 --> 06:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
committee for allowing me to make this
 
06:43:44.708 --> 06:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
presentation and I hope that you will
 
06:43:46.430 --> 06:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
support this
 
06:43:49.270 --> 06:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you I have a
 
06:43:53.150 --> 06:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
question or two um I G to get it
 
06:43:55.750 --> 06:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
straight you have the Statewide Public
 
06:43:59.388 --> 06:43:59.398 align:start position:0%
boat access fund and that is funded by
 
06:44:02.070 --> 06:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds and matching State funds
 
06:44:03.670 --> 06:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
from the
 
06:44:08.030 --> 06:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
motorboat uh Monies to be clear I'm
 
06:44:10.110 --> 06:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
using the term Statewide Public boat
 
06:44:13.750 --> 06:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
access fund as it is written in the RSA
 
06:44:18.868 --> 06:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
2338 colon 13 which is a $5 fee from
 
06:44:21.990 --> 06:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
boat registrations in the state okay the
 
06:44:24.990 --> 06:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
federal dollars are in addition to that
 
06:44:28.430 --> 06:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
um they come from an excise tax and from
 
06:44:31.510 --> 06:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
What's called the um the uh the
 
06:44:34.270 --> 06:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
sportfish restoration act which goes
 
06:44:35.708 --> 06:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
06:44:38.628 --> 06:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
1950s and we get an apportionment from
 
06:44:41.310 --> 06:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
the federal government based on uh our
 
06:44:45.548 --> 06:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
state size uh that we can use when we
 
06:44:49.708 --> 06:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
match it with our state funds so um it's
 
06:44:51.430 --> 06:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
two different pots of money they come
 
06:44:55.110 --> 06:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
together we use both to put the program
 
06:45:00.468 --> 06:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
forward and you're you're looking to put
 
06:45:02.350 --> 06:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
money that you would get from the
 
06:45:02.360 --> 06:45:04.430 align:start position:0%
money that you would get from the
non-motorized

06:45:04.430 --> 06:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
non-motorized
 
06:45:09.190 --> 06:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
folks into this fund with uh correct yep
 
06:45:11.708 --> 06:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
and would that increase your federal
 
06:45:15.388 --> 06:45:15.398 align:start position:0%
funding uh or is that not or is it or it
 
06:45:17.310 --> 06:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't go that
 
06:45:20.310 --> 06:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
way we we can access the federal funds
 
06:45:22.788 --> 06:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
if we have money to match right at this
 
06:45:24.430 --> 06:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
particular moment we actually have more
 
06:45:26.070 --> 06:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
State funds than we can get from the
 
06:45:29.468 --> 06:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
federal government oh okay but we still
 
06:45:31.750 --> 06:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
need more funds in order to operate I
 
06:45:34.628 --> 06:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
was just trying to find out you know if
 
06:45:36.910 --> 06:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
you put 10 bucks in you get 20 20 bucks
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
from the feds well if you put 15 bucks
 
06:45:42.628 --> 06:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
in you get 30 bucks from the feds at
 
06:45:45.430 --> 06:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
this particular time we we're already
 
06:45:47.788 --> 06:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
have enough money to get what we need
 
06:45:47.798 --> 06:45:48.548 align:start position:0%
have enough money to get what we need
from

06:45:48.548 --> 06:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:45:52.310 --> 06:45:52.320 align:start position:0%

have any
 
06:45:58.750 --> 06:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative ghou for
 
06:46:01.230 --> 06:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
question yes I have a question oh thank
 
06:46:04.150 --> 06:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
you for are taking my question
 
06:46:08.350 --> 06:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
um is this uh donation going to be quote
 
06:46:10.230 --> 06:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
unquote asked for every
 
06:46:13.548 --> 06:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
year or will people just do it when they
 
06:46:16.110 --> 06:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
want to do it does anybody know it's
 
06:46:19.910 --> 06:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to be totally voluntary um we're I
 
06:46:22.590 --> 06:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
mean we haven't figured out the the
 
06:46:25.150 --> 06:46:25.160 align:start position:0%
process for it I mean we might send in
 
06:46:27.030 --> 06:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
an email saying hey you donated last
 
06:46:30.190 --> 06:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
year would you like to um we're trying
 
06:46:33.548 --> 06:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
to we'll have to find a balance for how
 
06:46:35.510 --> 06:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
much we want to spend in time and and
 
06:46:40.948 --> 06:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
money to gain uh or to to have people
 
06:46:43.548 --> 06:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
reapply or re re
 
06:46:43.558 --> 06:46:45.270 align:start position:0%
reapply or re re
donate

06:46:45.270 --> 06:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
donate
 
06:46:47.948 --> 06:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that that will be cost
 
06:46:49.670 --> 06:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
effective I think we'll
 
06:46:52.150 --> 06:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
probably let it go and put this money
 
06:46:54.230 --> 06:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
towards the purpose that people are
 
06:46:56.910 --> 06:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
donating for and that's to improve the
 
06:47:00.510 --> 06:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
boat access opportunities in the state
 
06:47:02.948 --> 06:47:02.958 align:start position:0%
um we'll have to find that balance I'm
 
06:47:04.270 --> 06:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
not sure how it's working with the hike
 
06:47:06.868 --> 06:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
safe card exactly but I think we're not
 
06:47:11.910 --> 06:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
doing much um to promote that Beyond
 
06:47:13.990 --> 06:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
just having a note up on our website and
 
06:47:16.590 --> 06:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
so forth and that has shown that it's
 
06:47:19.590 --> 06:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
growing organically without a lot of um
 
06:47:19.600 --> 06:47:22.310 align:start position:0%
growing organically without a lot of um
extra

06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:22.320 --> 06:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
 
effort

06:47:27.590 --> 06:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:30.150 --> 06:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
did answer your
 
06:47:33.190 --> 06:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you representative
 
06:47:35.590 --> 06:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
Ean thank you Mr chair thank you sir for
 
06:47:37.270 --> 06:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
06:47:41.070 --> 06:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
question would there be similar
 
06:47:43.830 --> 06:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
potential Partnerships for this program
 
06:47:46.750 --> 06:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
similar to how the AMC supports the hike
 
06:47:48.670 --> 06:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
Safe program and therefore there would
 
06:47:50.708 --> 06:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
be other supportive organizations that
 
06:47:53.628 --> 06:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
could promote this program knowing that
 
06:47:56.270 --> 06:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
a donation program would help the state
 
06:47:59.388 --> 06:47:59.398 align:start position:0%
not try to put tax dollars taxpayer
 
06:48:02.030 --> 06:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
dollars towards this but that
 
06:48:03.750 --> 06:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
constituents who are interested in
 
06:48:07.788 --> 06:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
improving the uh boot locations would be
 
06:48:09.868 --> 06:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
able to support it like voters
 
06:48:12.110 --> 06:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
associations you know Lakes associations
 
06:48:14.430 --> 06:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
would there be would that opportunity be
 
06:48:16.350 --> 06:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
available there's no reason why it
 
06:48:18.230 --> 06:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be uh again I think we'd look
 
06:48:19.948 --> 06:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
into that those
 
06:48:19.958 --> 06:48:21.468 align:start position:0%
into that those
opportunities

06:48:21.468 --> 06:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
06:48:23.388 --> 06:48:23.398 align:start position:0%
um that that would again would would be
 
06:48:25.750 --> 06:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
a volunteer type effort that would help
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
us um to to make this a more successful
 
06:48:32.708 --> 06:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity and and promotion overall
 
06:48:35.468 --> 06:48:35.478 align:start position:0%
and again if we could encourage outside
 
06:48:38.468 --> 06:48:38.478 align:start position:0%
groups to promote it for us uh you know
 
06:48:40.150 --> 06:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's more there's more power when
 
06:48:41.590 --> 06:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
more people are doing the same thing
 
06:48:44.230 --> 06:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
pulling in the same direction so I would
 
06:48:45.990 --> 06:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
have to say yes we would do that you
 
06:48:51.110 --> 06:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:58.510 --> 06:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me any other questions
 
06:48:58.520 --> 06:49:00.150 align:start position:0%
excuse me any other questions
representative

06:49:00.150 --> 06:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:49:02.868 --> 06:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
Huff thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
06:49:02.878 --> 06:49:04.110 align:start position:0%
Huff thank you Mr chairman um thank you
for

06:49:04.110 --> 06:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:49:07.030 --> 06:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
testifying I'm I'm just curious is there
 
06:49:09.628 --> 06:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
any idea or mechanism to actually uh
 
06:49:12.590 --> 06:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
collect the funds yeah I mean is it
 
06:49:13.830 --> 06:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
going to be cash are you going to be
 
06:49:15.468 --> 06:49:15.478 align:start position:0%
able to take credit cards you gonna is
 
06:49:16.830 --> 06:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
there something already in place for
 
06:49:18.868 --> 06:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
that at these locations or is that
 
06:49:20.430 --> 06:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
something that would have to be
 
06:49:22.510 --> 06:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
developed well we don't take money at
 
06:49:24.990 --> 06:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
any of the of the boat access locations
 
06:49:27.388 --> 06:49:27.398 align:start position:0%
um they're they're free to access um
 
06:49:28.948 --> 06:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
they're open
 
06:49:33.910 --> 06:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
247 uh throughout the year um
 
06:49:37.350 --> 06:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
so the way the fees would probably or
 
06:49:40.548 --> 06:49:40.558 align:start position:0%
the the the donation would be um
 
06:49:42.990 --> 06:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
accepted would be along the same lines
 
06:49:45.548 --> 06:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
as we do with the house hike safe card
 
06:49:47.628 --> 06:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
we'd have an online process probably and
 
06:49:49.590 --> 06:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
certainly we'd have agents around the
 
06:49:52.430 --> 06:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
state where people are already allowed
 
06:49:54.350 --> 06:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
to buy or provided the opportunity to
 
06:49:57.310 --> 06:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
buy a fishing license and so forth or
 
06:49:59.990 --> 06:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
the hike safegard so those those same
 
06:50:03.150 --> 06:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
locations and mechanisms would be um
 
06:50:06.310 --> 06:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
used for this location I have to say
 
06:50:08.430 --> 06:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be a free uh
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity you know there's always
 
06:50:13.590 --> 06:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
going to be extra men admin cost to keep
 
06:50:15.788 --> 06:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
those to a minimum but the basic yep
 
06:50:17.708 --> 06:50:17.718 align:start position:0%
just okay thank
 
06:50:22.030 --> 06:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:25.510 --> 06:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
06:50:25.520 --> 06:50:29.468 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
thank

06:50:29.468 --> 06:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:34.350 --> 06:50:34.360 align:start position:0%
you Colonel Jordan did you uh want this
 
06:50:36.110 --> 06:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
says you want I presume you want to
 
06:50:42.150 --> 06:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:45.230 --> 06:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon my name is Colonel
 
06:50:47.468 --> 06:50:47.478 align:start position:0%
actually my name is Kevin Jordan and I'm
 
06:50:48.708 --> 06:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
the chief of law enforcement New
 
06:50:50.510 --> 06:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing gam so Mr chairman
 
06:50:51.788 --> 06:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
thanks for the opportunity there were a
 
06:50:53.468 --> 06:50:53.478 align:start position:0%
couple of really good questions
 
06:50:55.948 --> 06:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
that um were asked and I felt like I
 
06:50:57.310 --> 06:50:57.320 align:start position:0%
might be able to Enlighten it a little
 
06:51:00.310 --> 06:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
bit more I was part of the uh I was
 
06:51:02.590 --> 06:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
totally against uh and I think I can say
 
06:51:04.468 --> 06:51:04.478 align:start position:0%
that in a room I was totally against hik
 
06:51:05.868 --> 06:51:05.878 align:start position:0%
safe when they made it a voluntary
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
program I felt it would never work uh I
 
06:51:11.590 --> 06:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
was seeking more permanent type funding
 
06:51:14.388 --> 06:51:14.398 align:start position:0%
to fund that program because we it was a
 
06:51:16.310 --> 06:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
really a a program that was spinning out
 
06:51:18.510 --> 06:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
of control expense wise and the
 
06:51:20.468 --> 06:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
sportsmen were paying for the footing
 
06:51:23.190 --> 06:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
the bill hike safe proved me very very
 
06:51:25.070 --> 06:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
wrong it's been very successful in fact
 
06:51:26.868 --> 06:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
last year it brought in an excess of
 
06:51:30.468 --> 06:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
$300,000 now I equate some of that to co
 
06:51:32.270 --> 06:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
the governor uh came out and told
 
06:51:33.750 --> 06:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
everybody to get outside because it was
 
06:51:34.910 --> 06:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
safe and we were
 
06:51:37.590 --> 06:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
inundated uh so we slowed him down a
 
06:51:39.230 --> 06:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
little bit and we said listen we got to
 
06:51:41.190 --> 06:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
push hike safe and we got to tell people
 
06:51:43.030 --> 06:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't the time to do these 4,000
 
06:51:45.110 --> 06:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
Footers and so in the end it worked out
 
06:51:46.590 --> 06:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
really well and that generated a lot of
 
06:51:49.270 --> 06:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
money so I've had a lot of internal
 
06:51:50.948 --> 06:51:50.958 align:start position:0%
discussions and representative goalie
 
06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
has been extremely helpful in writing
 
06:51:55.990 --> 06:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh in the way he's crafted
 
06:51:58.270 --> 06:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
this it has given us the flexibility I
 
06:51:59.670 --> 06:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
think to do some of the things that
 
06:52:02.070 --> 06:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking so my point of coming up
 
06:52:03.708 --> 06:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
here was to tell you kind of what I'm
 
06:52:05.948 --> 06:52:05.958 align:start position:0%
pushing for in the agency and and it's
 
06:52:08.230 --> 06:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
to mirror a hike save I think it's been
 
06:52:10.310 --> 06:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
very successful I would look to make
 
06:52:13.230 --> 06:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
this the same or similar the other the
 
06:52:14.468 --> 06:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
other reason I would like to do that
 
06:52:16.310 --> 06:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's easier for people if we keep it
 
06:52:19.670 --> 06:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
simple uh so the goal would be uh in the
 
06:52:21.548 --> 06:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
third paragraph of the bill it gives the
 
06:52:25.070 --> 06:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
director the ability to go to rule of uh
 
06:52:27.190 --> 06:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
and J car of course would be required so
 
06:52:28.628 --> 06:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to sneak in a
 
06:52:30.628 --> 06:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
high fee we'll have to put in a fee that
 
06:52:32.868 --> 06:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
everyone is comfortable with but we were
 
06:52:34.510 --> 06:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of keeping it close to what
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
hike safe is we're thinking of offering
 
06:52:39.388 --> 06:52:39.398 align:start position:0%
the same protection to people who buy
 
06:52:41.350 --> 06:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
this as we would for hike safe so there
 
06:52:43.830 --> 06:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a need for folks to buy both
 
06:52:45.628 --> 06:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
because they've now contributed to the
 
06:52:47.510 --> 06:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the agency which contributes to the
 
06:52:50.190 --> 06:52:50.200 align:start position:0%
search and rescue fund so if they had a
 
06:52:53.110 --> 06:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
kayak pass and we had to rescue them uh
 
06:52:55.350 --> 06:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
I can see us doing the same we do with
 
06:52:57.070 --> 06:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
any other license that they have we
 
06:52:59.270 --> 06:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't charge them uh for the
 
06:53:01.788 --> 06:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
rescue uh so that would be an advertised
 
06:53:04.110 --> 06:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
benefit we we were thinking of the fee
 
06:53:07.230 --> 06:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
being very similar the $25 fee the there
 
06:53:11.150 --> 06:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
is a we allow them now to we we Advocate
 
06:53:12.990 --> 06:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
people to buy it online or they can come
 
06:53:16.430 --> 06:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
to a license uh station and buy
 
06:53:20.830 --> 06:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
it uh we have a credit card um fee that
 
06:53:23.628 --> 06:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
is charged to us in in in in hike safe I
 
06:53:25.590 --> 06:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
was told yesterday it's uh
 
06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
$22.75 every time they use a credit card
 
06:53:30.468 --> 06:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
so that reduced the money to about $22
 
06:53:32.708 --> 06:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
that we receive and the the goal would
 
06:53:34.788 --> 06:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
be to keep the administrative cost at a
 
06:53:36.750 --> 06:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
bare minimum as Garrett explained so
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
that most of this money would go to
 
06:53:40.150 --> 06:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
benefit the program I'm a firm believer
 
06:53:42.548 --> 06:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
if I'm donating to an agency or donating
 
06:53:45.070 --> 06:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
to a particular program I want my money
 
06:53:46.708 --> 06:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
to go there and I would assume everybody
 
06:53:48.628 --> 06:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
would want that so we try to keep the
 
06:53:50.910 --> 06:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
administrative cost down now having said
 
06:53:53.628 --> 06:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
that one hurdle on going to have I can
 
06:53:55.868 --> 06:53:55.878 align:start position:0%
tell you from talking to folks is they
 
06:53:58.030 --> 06:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
some people will be very proud of this
 
06:53:59.388 --> 06:53:59.398 align:start position:0%
that they donated and they want to be
 
06:54:01.468 --> 06:54:01.478 align:start position:0%
able to demonstrate the others that they
 
06:54:03.310 --> 06:54:03.320 align:start position:0%
donated and the way they would ask for
 
06:54:05.670 --> 06:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
that I can I can guess would be a
 
06:54:08.270 --> 06:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
sticker for their boat the problem with
 
06:54:09.990 --> 06:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is when you start doing those
 
06:54:13.070 --> 06:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
things you yeah you add cost and and so
 
06:54:14.388 --> 06:54:14.398 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how we're going to get over
 
06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
that hurdle yet that's one of the
 
06:54:17.868 --> 06:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
reasons I don't actually give them a
 
06:54:20.750 --> 06:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
hike safe card I get that call a lot
 
06:54:22.230 --> 06:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
they can print off the what's on the
 
06:54:23.270 --> 06:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
screen but but I don't give them an
 
06:54:24.548 --> 06:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
actual car because I'm trying to keep
 
06:54:26.110 --> 06:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
the cost I'm trying to make that money
 
06:54:28.708 --> 06:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
go into the fund and not be diverted a
 
06:54:30.750 --> 06:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
100 different ways and I would the goal
 
06:54:33.830 --> 06:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
for this would be the same um I'm always
 
06:54:36.868 --> 06:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
in favor of voluntary payments uh as a
 
06:54:39.468 --> 06:54:39.478 align:start position:0%
citizen I like that idea I I have
 
06:54:41.230 --> 06:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
changed my mind I think most people will
 
06:54:43.670 --> 06:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it and I'm I and I
 
06:54:45.150 --> 06:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
like Garrett have received a number of
 
06:54:47.310 --> 06:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
calls from people who have ctop boats
 
06:54:48.750 --> 06:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
that do want to contribute and there
 
06:54:50.750 --> 06:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
isn't a way to do that currently this
 
06:54:52.750 --> 06:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
bill would give us the ability to say
 
06:54:55.270 --> 06:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
you can do it here uh in hopes of
 
06:54:57.548 --> 06:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
opening up more access later so access
 
06:54:59.830 --> 06:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
is something that we as a state are
 
06:55:02.708 --> 06:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
concerned about we're losing it and so
 
06:55:05.350 --> 06:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
anytime that we can gain funding um you
 
06:55:07.788 --> 06:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
know to purchase that precious access I
 
06:55:10.788 --> 06:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
think is key so um so hopefully that
 
06:55:12.788 --> 06:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
answers the
 
06:55:15.590 --> 06:55:15.600 align:start position:0%

bill good afternoon thank you Mr
 
07:01:02.670 --> 07:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record Kevin Nyan I
 
07:01:05.788 --> 07:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
manage the environmental office at do uh
 
07:01:07.628 --> 07:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
and I am here to speak in support of the
 
07:01:10.430 --> 07:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill and uh specifically uh the bill as
 
07:01:13.670 --> 07:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
introduced on lines 21 through 23 um it
 
07:01:15.190 --> 07:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
was a number of years ago now I think I
 
07:01:17.990 --> 07:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
worked with uh representative grassy uh
 
07:01:20.190 --> 07:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
to identify some uh concerns that the
 
07:01:21.708 --> 07:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation had with
 
07:01:24.150 --> 07:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
respect ECT to Prime Wetlands uh and so
 
07:01:25.948 --> 07:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking specifically to that part
 
07:01:29.350 --> 07:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
of the bill which um would acknowledge
 
07:01:31.628 --> 07:01:31.638 align:start position:0%
that the department experiences
 
07:01:33.628 --> 07:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
challenges with prime Wetlands when and
 
07:01:34.948 --> 07:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
their buffers when they're located
 
07:01:37.270 --> 07:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
within the RightWay and it affects our
 
07:01:38.910 --> 07:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
ability to maintain the uh
 
07:01:42.548 --> 07:01:42.558 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in a in an efficient way
 
07:01:46.310 --> 07:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
um by example uh we have a a current
 
07:01:50.270 --> 07:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
project in Sandwich where we are doing a
 
07:01:53.388 --> 07:01:53.398 align:start position:0%
small covert upgrade which if not for
 
07:01:55.070 --> 07:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
the presence of a prime Wetland or a
 
07:01:57.750 --> 07:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
prime Wetland buffer in and at the right
 
07:01:59.628 --> 07:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
of way would not have needed a permit
 
07:02:01.070 --> 07:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
from the department but would have been
 
07:02:03.750 --> 07:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
able to be done under a notification and
 
07:02:05.388 --> 07:02:05.398 align:start position:0%
simply because there's a prime wetland
 
07:02:07.830 --> 07:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
in the vicinity it triggered us to have
 
07:02:10.910 --> 07:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
a uh the need for a permit which delays
 
07:02:12.590 --> 07:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
the maintenance that we have to that we
 
07:02:15.468 --> 07:02:15.478 align:start position:0%
have to do so I'm happy to answer any
 
07:02:17.110 --> 07:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have I'm I'm
 
07:02:18.590 --> 07:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful for the opportunity to work
 
07:02:21.548 --> 07:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
with the committee and um on on the bill
 
07:02:23.270 --> 07:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
07:02:27.430 --> 07:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
you any questions from Mr
 
07:02:30.868 --> 07:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
Nan seeing none U Mr chair I believe
 
07:02:34.110 --> 07:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:36.548 --> 07:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
question okay uh if I recall when they
 
07:02:39.350 --> 07:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
were doing 93 down in Wind Exit 3 I
 
07:02:41.270 --> 07:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
think it is wasn't there an issue like
 
07:02:43.468 --> 07:02:43.478 align:start position:0%
this there how does that compare to this
 
07:02:45.990 --> 07:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about so the two uh
 
07:02:47.948 --> 07:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um the two
 
07:02:49.868 --> 07:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
issues I would they're they're similar
 
07:02:51.230 --> 07:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
in that they're both Transportation
 
07:02:52.868 --> 07:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
related in the work that the department
 
07:02:54.990 --> 07:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
does on the highway I would say that
 
07:02:57.350 --> 07:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're different in that the expansion
 
07:02:59.830 --> 07:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the highway um outside of the
 
07:03:03.230 --> 07:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
existing right of way uh down in i93 is
 
07:03:05.190 --> 07:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
different than the maintenance type work
 
07:03:07.388 --> 07:03:07.398 align:start position:0%
that this bill um would kind of
 
07:03:10.270 --> 07:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
alleviate those those concerns for the
 
07:03:11.948 --> 07:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
Department recognizes that when we are
 
07:03:13.590 --> 07:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
we do have those larger projects and
 
07:03:16.110 --> 07:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
they're outside the right of way uh
 
07:03:18.110 --> 07:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
impacting locally designated Prime
 
07:03:19.910 --> 07:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
Wetlands it does introduce maybe an
 
07:03:22.190 --> 07:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
untenable impact at times and so those
 
07:03:24.510 --> 07:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
are treated very differently but similar
 
07:03:25.750 --> 07:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
in that they're both Transportation
 
07:03:29.510 --> 07:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:31.868 --> 07:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone
 
07:03:35.190 --> 07:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much thank you I
 
07:03:38.150 --> 07:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
should announce that uh we since we will
 
07:03:39.510 --> 07:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
be having
 
07:03:42.310 --> 07:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
another continuation of the hearing on
 
07:03:46.628 --> 07:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
this uh I will I will allow and would
 
07:03:50.350 --> 07:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
allow uh anyone who who's does testify
 
07:03:55.830 --> 07:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:59.628 --> 07:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
hearing I think especially if it a long
 
07:04:04.310 --> 07:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh long time difference
 
07:04:08.070 --> 07:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
Hiatus when uh when we get back together
 
07:04:20.388 --> 07:04:20.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:22.310 --> 07:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
Abbott represent presenting the
 
07:04:25.110 --> 07:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
associated general
 
07:04:27.590 --> 07:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
contractors thank you very much uh
 
07:04:30.548 --> 07:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
chairman rulu uh committee members for
 
07:04:32.830 --> 07:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Gary Abbott I'm
 
07:04:34.708 --> 07:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
the Executive Vice President of the
 
07:04:37.788 --> 07:04:37.798 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
07:04:40.910 --> 07:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I've done a paper I've
 
07:04:43.070 --> 07:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
discussed this issue I think four
 
07:04:45.750 --> 07:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
previous times that this legislation has
 
07:04:49.270 --> 07:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
not passed the legislature and I think
 
07:04:51.388 --> 07:04:51.398 align:start position:0%
today I just want to kind of give you
 
07:04:54.110 --> 07:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
may something I haven't done before
 
07:04:57.708 --> 07:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
first this bill is about prime wetlands
 
07:04:59.310 --> 07:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure the committee
 
07:05:01.270 --> 07:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
understands Prime Wetlands Prime
 
07:05:04.070 --> 07:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
Wetlands is a designation by a
 
07:05:07.270 --> 07:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
municipality for a given area that they
 
07:05:09.628 --> 07:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
want to preserve and they have to meet
 
07:05:11.628 --> 07:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
criteria that's in the state statute
 
07:05:14.190 --> 07:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
there's 12 different
 
07:05:16.548 --> 07:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
criteria but the biggest criteria is it
 
07:05:19.030 --> 07:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
has to be two acres or more where it
 
07:05:22.070 --> 07:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
can't get that designation now this was
 
07:05:25.388 --> 07:05:25.398 align:start position:0%
put in place way before many many years
 
07:05:27.750 --> 07:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
have gone by and rules and regulations
 
07:05:30.510 --> 07:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
have changed for wetlands and so what I
 
07:05:34.708 --> 07:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
want to discuss is that this is about we
 
07:05:37.628 --> 07:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
had many many years ago uh some very
 
07:05:39.670 --> 07:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
vague language of what a town could do
 
07:05:43.708 --> 07:05:43.718 align:start position:0%
and and designate we had lots of issues
 
07:05:46.230 --> 07:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
I was part of a statutory change to the
 
07:05:49.070 --> 07:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
prime Wetlands that we put in this 50
 
07:05:51.948 --> 07:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
foot across because we started to have
 
07:05:55.670 --> 07:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
culverts Brooks included in this
 
07:05:57.670 --> 07:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
designation which when you have this
 
07:06:00.350 --> 07:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
designation Dees when you go for a
 
07:06:02.708 --> 07:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
permit treats it differently than a
 
07:06:05.430 --> 07:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
regular Wetlands they consider it higher
 
07:06:07.270 --> 07:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
because the municipality said it was
 
07:06:09.510 --> 07:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
important but it doesn't necessarily
 
07:06:11.468 --> 07:06:11.478 align:start position:0%
have to be any more important than two
 
07:06:14.310 --> 07:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
acres up the road that wasn't
 
07:06:17.150 --> 07:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
designated so this today this bill that
 
07:06:18.910 --> 07:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
keeps coming back keeps talking about
 
07:06:21.750 --> 07:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
this 50F foot cut off so you have a
 
07:06:25.230 --> 07:06:25.240 align:start position:0%
two-acre wetland and you have a culvert
 
07:06:27.190 --> 07:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
or a brook or something going up that
 
07:06:30.430 --> 07:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
can be disputed by the consultant of
 
07:06:32.670 --> 07:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
whether this is part of a wetlands and
 
07:06:35.708 --> 07:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
the legislature agreed to do this 50
 
07:06:38.150 --> 07:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
foot cut off we really haven't had any
 
07:06:40.910 --> 07:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
issues with permits I haven't heard any
 
07:06:43.708 --> 07:06:43.718 align:start position:0%
great issues from the perspective of
 
07:06:45.468 --> 07:06:45.478 align:start position:0%
construction that I'm talking about
 
07:06:48.350 --> 07:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
today this comes up and a lot of the
 
07:06:50.388 --> 07:06:50.398 align:start position:0%
testimony you will hear in favor of the
 
07:06:52.548 --> 07:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
bill because I've heard it before
 
07:06:54.468 --> 07:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
is that you know you want to protect the
 
07:06:57.468 --> 07:06:57.478 align:start position:0%
wildlife or the the impact is too great
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
we need to designate it now you have to
 
07:07:02.150 --> 07:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
understand Prime Wetlands it's not a
 
07:07:05.708 --> 07:07:05.718 align:start position:0%
requirement to even delineate the area
 
07:07:08.150 --> 07:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
you can use a photograph the town can
 
07:07:10.830 --> 07:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
use a photograph and say this area we
 
07:07:12.990 --> 07:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
want to designate as Prime they didn't
 
07:07:14.430 --> 07:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
look at it they didn't get in there with
 
07:07:16.750 --> 07:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
Consultants it's not a requirement we
 
07:07:18.388 --> 07:07:18.398 align:start position:0%
have many prime Wetlands that are done
 
07:07:20.990 --> 07:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
by aerial photographs and it's on
 
07:07:23.070 --> 07:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
private property so I feel bad for the
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
private property owner because a town
 
07:07:27.670 --> 07:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
can do this without their permission
 
07:07:28.990 --> 07:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's the current law I'm really not
 
07:07:30.670 --> 07:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
debating that but that's what can happen
 
07:07:33.070 --> 07:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
today or any Prime
 
07:07:35.430 --> 07:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
Wetland our biggest sticking point has
 
07:07:37.548 --> 07:07:37.558 align:start position:0%
been if you start to expand this
 
07:07:40.230 --> 07:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
definition without the property owner's
 
07:07:42.468 --> 07:07:42.478 align:start position:0%
permission you know now you're starting
 
07:07:45.270 --> 07:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
to get into a future taking if
 
07:07:48.230 --> 07:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
development happens but let's skip all
 
07:07:51.670 --> 07:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
that let's go to I'm the contractor
 
07:07:55.350 --> 07:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
developer home builder Timber Harvester
 
07:07:57.030 --> 07:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
whoever goes onto a property to do
 
07:07:59.310 --> 07:07:59.320 align:start position:0%
something I have to comply with the
 
07:08:01.310 --> 07:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
wetlands bureau's
 
07:08:04.468 --> 07:08:04.478 align:start position:0%
regulations they're not easy they have
 
07:08:05.868 --> 07:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
thought of everything they've made
 
07:08:08.590 --> 07:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
modifications over the years that's when
 
07:08:10.830 --> 07:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
we have to as a developer comes in he
 
07:08:13.910 --> 07:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
has to delineate he has to look at it we
 
07:08:15.468 --> 07:08:15.478 align:start position:0%
get to do
 
07:08:17.750 --> 07:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation we get to do a lot of
 
07:08:19.190 --> 07:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
different things we have to avoid and
 
07:08:20.830 --> 07:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
minimize we have to take a lot of things
 
07:08:25.388 --> 07:08:25.398 align:start position:0%
into consider a but if it has this
 
07:08:28.628 --> 07:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
designation the dees calls it a special
 
07:08:31.910 --> 07:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
resource area and almost Cuts us off
 
07:08:34.830 --> 07:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
from those negotiations of happening
 
07:08:37.070 --> 07:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we fight so hard on this bill
 
07:08:40.788 --> 07:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
year after year because it sets a new
 
07:08:42.830 --> 07:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
standard that's very hard to overcome
 
07:08:42.840 --> 07:08:43.788 align:start position:0%
standard that's very hard to overcome
even

07:08:43.788 --> 07:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
even
 
07:08:46.868 --> 07:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
though environmentally technically we
 
07:08:49.310 --> 07:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
could mitigate or make compensation for
 
07:08:51.868 --> 07:08:51.878 align:start position:0%
it and that's why we fight hard on this
 
07:08:54.310 --> 07:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
designation that's more it's just a
 
07:08:56.948 --> 07:08:56.958 align:start position:0%
designation a prime wet lunch does not
 
07:08:58.990 --> 07:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean it's the best of the
 
07:09:02.150 --> 07:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
best it just means the town designated
 
07:09:05.468 --> 07:09:05.478 align:start position:0%
it I'd love to be in the town's position
 
07:09:08.110 --> 07:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
towns get to designate it there's some
 
07:09:09.830 --> 07:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
towns that suddenly needed a road they
 
07:09:13.628 --> 07:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
get to D desate it but a developer does
 
07:09:16.150 --> 07:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
not get to do that a home owner does not
 
07:09:19.270 --> 07:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
get to do that so some will say years
 
07:09:21.070 --> 07:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
ago I tried to work on this bill and
 
07:09:22.990 --> 07:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
come to a negotiation but I wanted
 
07:09:27.150 --> 07:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
landowner approval I clearly wanted land
 
07:09:29.070 --> 07:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
if the property owner agrees that they
 
07:09:32.190 --> 07:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
would Encompass these smaller areas it's
 
07:09:35.190 --> 07:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
their property I say it's okay that's
 
07:09:37.788 --> 07:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
they're making that choice but to leave
 
07:09:40.670 --> 07:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
it that a group of citizens can get
 
07:09:44.070 --> 07:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
together go to a city and designate it
 
07:09:47.150 --> 07:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
without the approval it bothers me and
 
07:09:49.548 --> 07:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
then it bothers me what we have to do if
 
07:09:52.030 --> 07:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
we go in to try to do something with
 
07:09:54.468 --> 07:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
property so that's why this bill I've
 
07:09:57.750 --> 07:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
handed out um a paper and I I just want
 
07:09:59.070 --> 07:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
to highlight
 
07:10:02.070 --> 07:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
this I have Consultants I have Wetland
 
07:10:04.388 --> 07:10:04.398 align:start position:0%
scientists that are members of our
 
07:10:07.270 --> 07:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
organization I have contractors I have
 
07:10:09.070 --> 07:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
sand and gravel sites that get involved
 
07:10:11.270 --> 07:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
in all of this but I wanted to give you
 
07:10:13.590 --> 07:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
this sample and we've used this
 
07:10:16.150 --> 07:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
before the top picture on the back of
 
07:10:18.948 --> 07:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
the position paper is a prime Wetlands
 
07:10:21.910 --> 07:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
now without the 50 without you know you
 
07:10:24.590 --> 07:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
can't go beyond the 50 Foot the bottom
 
07:10:27.628 --> 07:10:27.638 align:start position:0%
one is the same development but if you
 
07:10:30.190 --> 07:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
Encompass and you allow these
 
07:10:33.070 --> 07:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
tributaries or areas where less than 50
 
07:10:36.430 --> 07:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
feet you could Encompass all of this
 
07:10:38.708 --> 07:10:38.718 align:start position:0%
property and this is just to show you
 
07:10:41.310 --> 07:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
this is a real property in New Hampshire
 
07:10:44.070 --> 07:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it's to show the difference we feel
 
07:10:45.948 --> 07:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
like we solved this issue when we put in
 
07:10:48.310 --> 07:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
the 50 Foot and I would hope this
 
07:10:49.948 --> 07:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
committee would really look at it with
 
07:10:51.708 --> 07:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
new eyes and say
 
07:10:53.110 --> 07:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
maybe we should leave it because the
 
07:10:55.990 --> 07:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
current regulations I'm not even sure in
 
07:10:58.708 --> 07:10:58.718 align:start position:0%
the long haul this designation still
 
07:11:00.468 --> 07:11:00.478 align:start position:0%
needs to be in place what really needs
 
07:11:03.910 --> 07:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
to happen is Dees somebody needs to fund
 
07:11:07.190 --> 07:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
a study to save the most valuable
 
07:11:09.990 --> 07:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
Wetlands I was hoping I would say three
 
07:11:12.430 --> 07:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
years ago I thought there was a study
 
07:11:15.670 --> 07:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
going to be done by Dees to come up with
 
07:11:17.708 --> 07:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
those water bodies that were very
 
07:11:19.628 --> 07:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
valuable because I don't think this
 
07:11:21.670 --> 07:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
designation makes that
 
07:11:24.030 --> 07:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
designation but another process in which
 
07:11:26.110 --> 07:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
we can say to the these are the ones to
 
07:11:29.230 --> 07:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
save we're for we're for supporting
 
07:11:31.070 --> 07:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
environmental measures that protect the
 
07:11:33.110 --> 07:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
environment but the prime Wetlands
 
07:11:35.948 --> 07:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
procedure doesn't necessarily do that it
 
07:11:37.670 --> 07:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
just is a
 
07:11:39.910 --> 07:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
designation I know I went on and on
 
07:11:42.190 --> 07:11:42.200 align:start position:0%
probably longer than my five minutes
 
07:11:44.830 --> 07:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
chairman but I would be happy to answer
 
07:11:46.990 --> 07:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
any questions I would hope that the
 
07:11:50.110 --> 07:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh does not support this uh
 
07:11:52.468 --> 07:11:52.478 align:start position:0%
changing the def and the boundary it's
 
07:11:55.830 --> 07:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
really about this 50 foot it's not about
 
07:11:57.948 --> 07:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
the wetlands regulations it's not about
 
07:12:00.150 --> 07:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
all these other things it's about
 
07:12:02.670 --> 07:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
expanding the area with that I would end
 
07:12:02.680 --> 07:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
expanding the area with that I would end
my

07:12:05.030 --> 07:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:07.468 --> 07:12:07.478 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you any questions by
 
07:12:11.750 --> 07:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:14.430 --> 07:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
07:12:14.440 --> 07:12:17.590 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very

07:12:32.190 --> 07:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
bill good afternoon thank you for the
 
07:12:34.510 --> 07:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is Ron
 
07:12:36.708 --> 07:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
clarik I'm a consultant Forester have
 
07:12:39.948 --> 07:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
been consultant Forester since 1980 uh
 
07:12:42.750 --> 07:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
my clients include private land owners
 
07:12:45.070 --> 07:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
quasi public such as a Boy Scout and
 
07:12:46.628 --> 07:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
quite a few towns and
 
07:12:51.070 --> 07:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
cities um as a Forester conservationist
 
07:12:53.110 --> 07:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
I I respect Wetlands appreciate the
 
07:12:56.070 --> 07:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
value of wetlands and in my Timber sales
 
07:12:58.548 --> 07:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
I religiously leave buffer zones along
 
07:13:00.430 --> 07:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
Wetlands streams and rivers lakes you
 
07:13:03.070 --> 07:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
know and water bodies drenal pools that
 
07:13:05.868 --> 07:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
type of thing but uh due to things like
 
07:13:08.548 --> 07:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
terrain or boundary lines or access
 
07:13:11.270 --> 07:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
points um sometimes I have to cross
 
07:13:14.990 --> 07:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
intermittent streams or streams and um
 
07:13:16.510 --> 07:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
and if they are attached to a prime
 
07:13:19.788 --> 07:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
Wetland it does become quite a uh quite
 
07:13:22.230 --> 07:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
a bureaucratic cast to to deal with
 
07:13:24.830 --> 07:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
these things as previous speaker
 
07:13:27.670 --> 07:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh extra costs for the
 
07:13:30.990 --> 07:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
permitting process there already is a
 
07:13:33.190 --> 07:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
permitting process that that we have to
 
07:13:34.388 --> 07:13:34.398 align:start position:0%
go through if we are going to be
 
07:13:37.910 --> 07:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
Crossing wetlands and when you add uh
 
07:13:40.510 --> 07:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
additional paperwork expense to the
 
07:13:43.750 --> 07:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
landowner uh my time uh that's something
 
07:13:45.788 --> 07:13:45.798 align:start position:0%
that I would normally try to protect try
 
07:13:48.590 --> 07:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
to minimize the impact now there is a
 
07:13:50.310 --> 07:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
big difference between a Timber Harvest
 
07:13:52.590 --> 07:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
that I do where I enter the property
 
07:13:55.750 --> 07:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
maybe once every 15 or 20 years versus a
 
07:13:57.708 --> 07:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
developer going in and putting in houses
 
07:14:00.110 --> 07:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
and you end up with backyards and tennis
 
07:14:03.388 --> 07:14:03.398 align:start position:0%
courts and streets and that have storm
 
07:14:07.388 --> 07:14:07.398 align:start position:0%
water issues and things like that so um
 
07:14:09.990 --> 07:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
I would kind of oppose the bill as
 
07:14:12.230 --> 07:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
presented but if it was to exempt
 
07:14:15.030 --> 07:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
forestry and passive Recreation for
 
07:14:17.628 --> 07:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
Trails uh you know for hiking cross
 
07:14:19.510 --> 07:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
country skiing that type of thing I
 
07:14:21.270 --> 07:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem with it but but
 
07:14:24.310 --> 07:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh it does put quite a hassle on on on a
 
07:14:28.990 --> 07:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
land owner and uh and I I would having
 
07:14:30.430 --> 07:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with these and it was several
 
07:14:33.388 --> 07:14:33.398 align:start position:0%
towns even my own clients towns it it it
 
07:14:35.430 --> 07:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with people who aren't in the
 
07:14:37.030 --> 07:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
town that don't have the environmental
 
07:14:39.230 --> 07:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
background it can get very confusing to
 
07:14:41.670 --> 07:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
them so for that reason I I oppose this
 
07:14:43.350 --> 07:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill as
 
07:14:45.990 --> 07:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
presented thank you very much any
 
07:14:46.000 --> 07:14:47.670 align:start position:0%
presented thank you very much any
questions

07:14:47.670 --> 07:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
07:14:52.750 --> 07:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh from the uh testifier
 
07:14:58.990 --> 07:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:02.030 --> 07:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
you chair calls

peace representing
 
07:15:17.830 --> 07:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
nanners yes hi good afternoon everyone
 
07:15:20.150 --> 07:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Kimberly peace I am the
 
07:15:22.590 --> 07:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
senior en enal coordinator for H Tanner
 
07:15:24.868 --> 07:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
Associates and today I'm here to speak
 
07:15:27.468 --> 07:15:27.478 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the na New Hampshire
 
07:15:29.388 --> 07:15:29.398 align:start position:0%
Association of natural resource
 
07:15:31.510 --> 07:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
scientists uh which goes by the acronym
 
07:15:33.830 --> 07:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
of nners and for those of you that
 
07:15:36.310 --> 07:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
aren't aware we are the organization in
 
07:15:39.230 --> 07:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
the state that is the collective of
 
07:15:42.670 --> 07:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
wetlands and soil scientists and we have
 
07:15:44.430 --> 07:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
looked at this bill as it has come
 
07:15:47.430 --> 07:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
forward over the past several years and
 
07:15:50.310 --> 07:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
we are in I'm speaking today as the an
 
07:15:52.910 --> 07:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
opposition on behalf of nanners for this
 
07:15:55.628 --> 07:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
bill Mr Abbot introduced several
 
07:15:57.948 --> 07:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
important points about what prime
 
07:16:00.708 --> 07:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
wetlands are and how they are protected
 
07:16:03.510 --> 07:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
um it is up to a municipality to have
 
07:16:06.590 --> 07:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
those Wetlands identified I I would say
 
07:16:09.788 --> 07:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
that um as Mr Abbott pointed out um in
 
07:16:11.788 --> 07:16:11.798 align:start position:0%
most situations a professional Wetland
 
07:16:13.510 --> 07:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
scientist is brought in to do that but
 
07:16:15.670 --> 07:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
in some situations for smaller towns
 
07:16:17.350 --> 07:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
they do determine what the prime
 
07:16:20.070 --> 07:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
wetlands are and um that's been a
 
07:16:21.670 --> 07:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
process that has occurred over time
 
07:16:23.910 --> 07:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
since the origin the origin of that
 
07:16:27.590 --> 07:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
Prime Wetland um part of the RSA and the
 
07:16:29.990 --> 07:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
intent as as he said was to protect
 
07:16:32.388 --> 07:16:32.398 align:start position:0%
those valuable important resources to
 
07:16:34.868 --> 07:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
our state if you think about a wetland
 
07:16:37.110 --> 07:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's larger than two acres that's an
 
07:16:38.990 --> 07:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
important resource it's large enough
 
07:16:40.388 --> 07:16:40.398 align:start position:0%
that it's going to have a lot of
 
07:16:42.830 --> 07:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
important Wildlife functions functions
 
07:16:45.510 --> 07:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
for water quality protection and so we
 
07:16:48.350 --> 07:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
do support a protection of those Prime
 
07:16:50.708 --> 07:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
Wetlands but the reason why we
 
07:16:53.388 --> 07:16:53.398 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill is that it it
 
07:16:56.388 --> 07:16:56.398 align:start position:0%
picks up those small narrow connections
 
07:16:58.910 --> 07:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
and if you notice in the second part of
 
07:17:01.190 --> 07:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
the bill there there is that addition
 
07:17:04.628 --> 07:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
that revision that really um oversteps
 
07:17:07.750 --> 07:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
the the 50 Foot width and goes into some
 
07:17:11.030 --> 07:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
of these narrower Wetland channels and
 
07:17:12.350 --> 07:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
when you think about the Wetland
 
07:17:14.310 --> 07:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
functions as a professional Wetland
 
07:17:16.230 --> 07:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
scientist and how we approach what's
 
07:17:17.788 --> 07:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
valuable and what functions and
 
07:17:20.310 --> 07:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
resources do those Wetland fingers bring
 
07:17:22.190 --> 07:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
to the the table they're not as
 
07:17:25.150 --> 07:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
essential as that Prime Wetland body
 
07:17:28.430 --> 07:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is is worth the protection and and
 
07:17:30.628 --> 07:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
as Mr Abbott I think Pro provided for
 
07:17:33.230 --> 07:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
you some mapping there is a substantial
 
07:17:35.468 --> 07:17:35.478 align:start position:0%
increase in the prime Wetland area that
 
07:17:39.070 --> 07:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
would be covered by this change and what
 
07:17:42.590 --> 07:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
happens is once you have a prime Wetland
 
07:17:45.150 --> 07:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
if you need a wetland permit that Prime
 
07:17:47.230 --> 07:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
Wetland is considered a priority
 
07:17:49.948 --> 07:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
resource area that's under the new rules
 
07:17:51.910 --> 07:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
that were changed several years ago so
 
07:17:53.788 --> 07:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire DS Wetland rules has
 
07:17:55.388 --> 07:17:55.398 align:start position:0%
several characters of a wetland that
 
07:17:57.670 --> 07:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
gives it the highest level of protection
 
07:17:59.948 --> 07:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
and if you a priority resource area
 
07:18:02.070 --> 07:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
which is the prime Wetland you have the
 
07:18:03.670 --> 07:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
highest protection and so your number
 
07:18:06.628 --> 07:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
one way to to if you want to affect that
 
07:18:09.590 --> 07:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
Wetland you have to provide full a very
 
07:18:12.788 --> 07:18:12.798 align:start position:0%
solid uh avoidance minimization and and
 
07:18:14.548 --> 07:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
you have to really look at that Wetland
 
07:18:17.510 --> 07:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's very well scrutinized and and so we
 
07:18:19.350 --> 07:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
want this protection for our best
 
07:18:20.948 --> 07:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
Wetlands for our finest w wetlands in
 
07:18:23.670 --> 07:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
the state but what we don't want it for
 
07:18:27.070 --> 07:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
as as uh as Kevin Nyan was spoke so well
 
07:18:29.468 --> 07:18:29.478 align:start position:0%
of is these smaller Wetland channels
 
07:18:31.590 --> 07:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
where we have stream crossings that have
 
07:18:34.270 --> 07:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
pipes for example so in order for you to
 
07:18:36.270 --> 07:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
permit a project that has a pipe if that
 
07:18:38.468 --> 07:18:38.478 align:start position:0%
were Prime Wetland you would first of
 
07:18:41.150 --> 07:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
all have to prove Ironclad that you have
 
07:18:43.948 --> 07:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
no way to not cross that Wetland and
 
07:18:45.750 --> 07:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
then number two you would have to
 
07:18:48.310 --> 07:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
provide mitigation for that and that's a
 
07:18:49.830 --> 07:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
sizable challenge for some of our
 
07:18:52.548 --> 07:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
municipali who have small projects think
 
07:18:54.468 --> 07:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
about how many times your roads cross
 
07:18:56.190 --> 07:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
pipes and those pipes have to be
 
07:18:58.868 --> 07:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
upgraded over time and when we end up
 
07:19:01.628 --> 07:19:01.638 align:start position:0%
with these small Wetland fingers it just
 
07:19:03.868 --> 07:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
provides additional layer of protection
 
07:19:06.030 --> 07:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
to the wetlands that we don't think were
 
07:19:07.868 --> 07:19:07.878 align:start position:0%
are valuable and worthy of that extra
 
07:19:08.990 --> 07:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
layer of
 
07:19:11.230 --> 07:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
protection and the second reason I would
 
07:19:13.310 --> 07:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
say that we are opposing to this bill
 
07:19:16.230 --> 07:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's not so much that it's complicated
 
07:19:19.868 --> 07:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
to to um come into effect as it's it's
 
07:19:22.590 --> 07:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
based on less of firm Wetland science
 
07:19:25.310 --> 07:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
than we would like to see in in such a
 
07:19:28.310 --> 07:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
proposal so if the state wants to say we
 
07:19:29.788 --> 07:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
think we need an increase in our Prime
 
07:19:32.388 --> 07:19:32.398 align:start position:0%
Wetlands what we'd really like to see is
 
07:19:34.788 --> 07:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
organization to come to nanners and ask
 
07:19:36.468 --> 07:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
us as Wetland scientists and the people
 
07:19:38.070 --> 07:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
who are out in the field and looking at
 
07:19:40.388 --> 07:19:40.398 align:start position:0%
these what's our important resources
 
07:19:42.590 --> 07:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
what are we missing the language in here
 
07:19:44.868 --> 07:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
is just a little bit too vague and it's
 
07:19:46.708 --> 07:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's reaching for a lot of
 
07:19:48.388 --> 07:19:48.398 align:start position:0%
different Wetlands that maybe don't have
 
07:19:49.830 --> 07:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
that value that really need that
 
07:19:49.840 --> 07:19:51.310 align:start position:0%
that value that really need that
additional

07:19:51.310 --> 07:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
additional
 
07:19:53.590 --> 07:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
and I would also say as a final point we
 
07:19:56.750 --> 07:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
are in support of Mr nyan's proposal
 
07:20:00.510 --> 07:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire do um be exempt from
 
07:20:02.310 --> 07:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
Wetland Prime Wetlands especially within
 
07:20:04.468 --> 07:20:04.478 align:start position:0%
the dot rways because they are so
 
07:20:06.628 --> 07:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
challenging and because they do present
 
07:20:08.830 --> 07:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
such a problem um and I think that
 
07:20:12.270 --> 07:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
that's a separate situation and so we're
 
07:20:15.030 --> 07:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
proposing opposition to this bill as it
 
07:20:17.110 --> 07:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
it stands but we're not in opposition to
 
07:20:18.510 --> 07:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
his point I think his point is very
 
07:20:20.510 --> 07:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
valid but unfortunately I think I think
 
07:20:22.310 --> 07:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
that this bill just doesn't come forward
 
07:20:24.548 --> 07:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
with enough science behind it to provide
 
07:20:26.708 --> 07:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
additional Prime Wetland protection that
 
07:20:29.708 --> 07:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
is necessary at this point and uh if the
 
07:20:31.430 --> 07:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislator was willing to work together
 
07:20:33.788 --> 07:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
with nanners to come up with ways in
 
07:20:35.468 --> 07:20:35.478 align:start position:0%
which we really think this needs to be
 
07:20:37.670 --> 07:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
changed and in a valid manner then we
 
07:20:39.190 --> 07:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
would support that and be willing to
 
07:20:41.990 --> 07:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:48.150 --> 07:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:50.548 --> 07:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
testifier seeing none thank thank you
 
07:20:50.558 --> 07:21:01.150 align:start position:0%
testifier seeing none thank thank you
very

07:21:01.150 --> 07:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:04.230 --> 07:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
much Jason stock

07:21:13.868 --> 07:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
Association it's been a long
 
07:21:19.230 --> 07:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:22.430 --> 07:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
out I failed to mention in my testimony
 
07:21:24.110 --> 07:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
earlier we do
 
07:21:49.150 --> 07:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:49.160 --> 07:22:06.310 align:start position:0%

07:22:08.230 --> 07:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
oh wonderful
 
07:22:19.150 --> 07:22:19.160 align:start position:0%

07:22:32.150 --> 07:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um uh again for the second
 
07:22:33.868 --> 07:22:33.878 align:start position:0%
time today for the for the record I'm
 
07:22:35.788 --> 07:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
Jason stock I'm the executive director
 
07:22:37.910 --> 07:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
07:22:40.190 --> 07:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
Association I think this morning I
 
07:22:42.030 --> 07:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
failed to mention our our membership and
 
07:22:43.948 --> 07:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
kind of who we are and why we would have
 
07:22:47.150 --> 07:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
an interest in a Wetlands Bill we
 
07:22:49.430 --> 07:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
represent Timberland owners and these
 
07:22:49.440 --> 07:22:50.708 align:start position:0%
represent Timberland owners and these
are

07:22:50.708 --> 07:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
are
 
07:22:52.548 --> 07:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
these range from companies like
 
07:22:54.468 --> 07:22:54.478 align:start position:0%
warehouser that own hundreds of
 
07:22:57.750 --> 07:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of acres to small tree farms
 
07:23:01.750 --> 07:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
folks that own 10 12 15 20 acres cut
 
07:23:03.708 --> 07:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
their own firewood burn it in their wood
 
07:23:07.190 --> 07:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
stove we Al also represent businesses
 
07:23:10.590 --> 07:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
that derive their income or their
 
07:23:13.628 --> 07:23:13.638 align:start position:0%
livelihood from Forest Products and it's
 
07:23:17.670 --> 07:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
the entire food chain it's Consulting
 
07:23:20.708 --> 07:23:20.718 align:start position:0%
Foresters loggers
 
07:23:24.190 --> 07:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
Sawmills log truck drivers yes paper
 
07:23:28.110 --> 07:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
mills and biomass power biomass energy
 
07:23:31.990 --> 07:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
plants um and pellet mills and you can
 
07:23:34.590 --> 07:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
firewood processors you can go on and on
 
07:23:36.868 --> 07:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
we have about 1300 members our
 
07:23:38.750 --> 07:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
membership owns or manages about a
 
07:23:41.150 --> 07:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
million acres of land in in the state of
 
07:23:44.670 --> 07:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we cover a lot of
 
07:23:48.510 --> 07:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
territory we have we we manage a lot of
 
07:23:50.910 --> 07:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
land and as you heard from from Mr
 
07:23:52.990 --> 07:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
claric who spoke earlier who's who's a
 
07:23:56.030 --> 07:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
member of ours we our members have an
 
07:23:59.510 --> 07:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
interest we love trees um we love
 
07:24:02.270 --> 07:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
Wildlife we manage for all these things
 
07:24:05.110 --> 07:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
when we do we do management it's you
 
07:24:07.110 --> 07:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
know it's multiple Resource
 
07:24:10.670 --> 07:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
Management um and so that's why I spoke
 
07:24:13.070 --> 07:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
earlier on a recreation issue we manage
 
07:24:15.830 --> 07:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
Trails things of that nature so our
 
07:24:19.948 --> 07:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
interest in in this bill is on that land
 
07:24:23.190 --> 07:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
are wetlands and in 33 towns in the
 
07:24:25.788 --> 07:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire they have opted
 
07:24:28.388 --> 07:24:28.398 align:start position:0%
to designate Wetlands a number of
 
07:24:29.990 --> 07:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
wetlands within their jurisdiction or
 
07:24:32.190 --> 07:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
their political jurisdiction as
 
07:24:35.190 --> 07:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
Prime my introduction to Prime Wetlands
 
07:24:37.628 --> 07:24:37.638 align:start position:0%
really came about it was right around
 
07:24:39.110 --> 07:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
the time that the
 
07:24:41.788 --> 07:24:41.798 align:start position:0%
Shoreland um the Shoreland Protection
 
07:24:44.948 --> 07:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
Law was was was coming into coming into
 
07:24:47.190 --> 07:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
being I got a call from a Forester that
 
07:24:50.190 --> 07:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
said hey I'm being told I can't use this
 
07:24:52.308 --> 07:24:52.318 align:start position:0%
road that I've used for years and years
 
07:24:54.948 --> 07:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
and years and years with this client and
 
07:24:58.150 --> 07:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
this was down in the kind of the um
 
07:25:01.430 --> 07:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
Madbury area of the state barington
 
07:25:03.948 --> 07:25:03.958 align:start position:0%
Madbury I thought well gez you know it's
 
07:25:06.150 --> 07:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
near a Wetlands could this possibly have
 
07:25:07.670 --> 07:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
something to do with the new Shoreland
 
07:25:09.948 --> 07:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
Protection Law no what it did was it had
 
07:25:12.628 --> 07:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
to do with this what at the time was a
 
07:25:14.350 --> 07:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
change to the prime Wetlands law that
 
07:25:17.308 --> 07:25:17.318 align:start position:0%
required a 100 foot buffer up until that
 
07:25:20.190 --> 07:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
point and as you heard from Gary Abbott
 
07:25:22.350 --> 07:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of the v a lot of the definitions
 
07:25:24.308 --> 07:25:24.318 align:start position:0%
and terms in the law were kind of vague
 
07:25:26.750 --> 07:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
and up into that point the way the law
 
07:25:29.150 --> 07:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
read was if you're going to do timber
 
07:25:32.510 --> 07:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
harvesting in or adjacent well what's
 
07:25:35.948 --> 07:25:35.958 align:start position:0%
adjacent and and so these Foresters
 
07:25:38.308 --> 07:25:38.318 align:start position:0%
again as you heard from Ron they use
 
07:25:40.270 --> 07:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
their professional judgment they go out
 
07:25:43.350 --> 07:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
there and say yep you know it's getting
 
07:25:45.110 --> 07:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
soft over there I'm going to stay out of
 
07:25:47.230 --> 07:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
that area I'm not going to harvest there
 
07:25:50.708 --> 07:25:50.718 align:start position:0%
Etc well you put into statue
 
07:25:54.830 --> 07:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
a definite distance 100 feet now that
 
07:25:57.590 --> 07:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
truck road which had been used for years
 
07:25:57.600 --> 07:25:58.430 align:start position:0%
truck road which had been used for years
and

07:25:58.430 --> 07:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:26:00.990 --> 07:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
years it was 100 feet from the side of
 
07:26:04.308 --> 07:26:04.318 align:start position:0%
that Wetland can't do it it's within the
 
07:26:06.750 --> 07:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
buffer and so we looked at it and we
 
07:26:09.270 --> 07:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
said geez this is you know this is not
 
07:26:10.910 --> 07:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't believe this was in the spirit
 
07:26:13.948 --> 07:26:13.958 align:start position:0%
of the law everyone agrees Forest I
 
07:26:15.628 --> 07:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
think most people would agree forestry
 
07:26:17.270 --> 07:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
Forest management and all the things
 
07:26:19.548 --> 07:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
associated with are a good thing but yet
 
07:26:21.388 --> 07:26:21.398 align:start position:0%
we we have a law here that's designed to
 
07:26:24.388 --> 07:26:24.398 align:start position:0%
protect Wetlands but at the same time
 
07:26:27.548 --> 07:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
can be can become a hurdle to that and
 
07:26:30.150 --> 07:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
so that was my introduction to Prime
 
07:26:32.590 --> 07:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
wetlands and as we got into it and I
 
07:26:34.468 --> 07:26:34.478 align:start position:0%
started getting calls from other
 
07:26:37.430 --> 07:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
Foresters saying hey I can no longer
 
07:26:40.830 --> 07:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
access the back 40 because I have to
 
07:26:43.308 --> 07:26:43.318 align:start position:0%
cross a prime Wetland and in order for
 
07:26:45.468 --> 07:26:45.478 align:start position:0%
me to do that I have to obtain a
 
07:26:47.628 --> 07:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
standard dredge and fill major project
 
07:26:50.110 --> 07:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
permit this project there's just not
 
07:26:52.070 --> 07:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
enough wood or not enough money in wood
 
07:26:55.788 --> 07:26:55.798 align:start position:0%
chips and cordwood to sustain that and
 
07:26:58.388 --> 07:26:58.398 align:start position:0%
so you know we started I started getting
 
07:27:00.468 --> 07:27:00.478 align:start position:0%
calls I don't get a lot of calls I
 
07:27:02.948 --> 07:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
probably get a couple a year and you'd
 
07:27:04.830 --> 07:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
say well that's not a big deal well if
 
07:27:06.868 --> 07:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
you're that landowner or the family that
 
07:27:10.110 --> 07:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
owns that property it is a big deal and
 
07:27:13.510 --> 07:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
so this bill which expands what can be
 
07:27:15.788 --> 07:27:15.798 align:start position:0%
eligible for a prime Wetland
 
07:27:18.150 --> 07:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
designation really starts to become a
 
07:27:21.628 --> 07:27:21.638 align:start position:0%
problem for us because it affects it
 
07:27:23.830 --> 07:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
really does have an impact on forestry
 
07:27:26.510 --> 07:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
and Forest management and the ability
 
07:27:29.430 --> 07:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
and and again how it affects
 
07:27:32.070 --> 07:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
us most people if there's cat and
 
07:27:34.190 --> 07:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
Ninetails growing out there there's no
 
07:27:35.788 --> 07:27:35.798 align:start position:0%
trees you're not going to harvest it
 
07:27:38.030 --> 07:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
most people say Jason what's the big
 
07:27:40.430 --> 07:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
deal there's no trees out there to worry
 
07:27:42.868 --> 07:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
about anyway well if you picture a
 
07:27:44.548 --> 07:27:44.558 align:start position:0%
wetland and kind of picture we used to
 
07:27:46.628 --> 07:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
always call this the finger and toe Bell
 
07:27:47.468 --> 07:27:47.478 align:start position:0%
and those who' have been on the
 
07:27:49.830 --> 07:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
committee for a while know that that Ty
 
07:27:53.030 --> 07:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
for this I see representative Smith the
 
07:27:55.270 --> 07:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
finger Infamous finger and toe Bell if
 
07:27:57.230 --> 07:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
you think of a wetland as a as a hand
 
07:27:58.830 --> 07:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
and you have the palm of your hand as
 
07:28:01.150 --> 07:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
the the body of the Wetland and then you
 
07:28:03.670 --> 07:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
have inlets and Outlets that occur to it
 
07:28:05.230 --> 07:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
well if you have a if you have a piece
 
07:28:08.150 --> 07:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
of if you have to go obviously that that
 
07:28:10.070 --> 07:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
Palm is your cat and Ninetails kind of
 
07:28:12.510 --> 07:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
where the water is and you say all right
 
07:28:14.510 --> 07:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go around that to access
 
07:28:17.150 --> 07:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
the back 40 well now I've got a finger
 
07:28:19.190 --> 07:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
sticking out and maybe there's a
 
07:28:21.430 --> 07:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
property line there across the first
 
07:28:23.750 --> 07:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
knuckle and I get well how do I get to
 
07:28:27.070 --> 07:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
the back 40 without cross without
 
07:28:29.110 --> 07:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
Crossing that do I go and try to
 
07:28:31.590 --> 07:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the neighbor is that even
 
07:28:34.788 --> 07:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
an option and so does the topography
 
07:28:38.190 --> 07:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
even allow it and so what this does is
 
07:28:41.150 --> 07:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
it not only has the potential to take
 
07:28:44.948 --> 07:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
land out of forest management directly
 
07:28:47.670 --> 07:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
but it also cuts off access to other
 
07:28:50.110 --> 07:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
parts of the property where you may say
 
07:28:52.430 --> 07:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
well that Back 40 that's high and dry
 
07:28:55.308 --> 07:28:55.318 align:start position:0%
you can cut that to until you're till
 
07:28:58.628 --> 07:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
you're happy well I can't get to it or
 
07:29:00.750 --> 07:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
in order for me to get to it I have to
 
07:29:02.910 --> 07:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
obtain a standard dredge and fill major
 
07:29:05.948 --> 07:29:05.958 align:start position:0%
project permit for a Timber Harvest I
 
07:29:08.548 --> 07:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
have to hire a wetland scientist to come
 
07:29:12.628 --> 07:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
in and do the assessment and design or
 
07:29:16.110 --> 07:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
engineer a Crossing to cross this finger
 
07:29:20.910 --> 07:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
and so um that's why this bill is is is
 
07:29:23.150 --> 07:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
problematic that's why we have opposed
 
07:29:25.468 --> 07:29:25.478 align:start position:0%
it for the last I think three to four
 
07:29:27.308 --> 07:29:27.318 align:start position:0%
times it's it's been through the mill
 
07:29:30.030 --> 07:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
here and and that's why we're we're here
 
07:29:30.040 --> 07:29:30.830 align:start position:0%
here and and that's why we're we're here
again

07:29:30.830 --> 07:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
07:29:38.230 --> 07:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:41.468 --> 07:29:41.478 align:start position:0%
it I think I think given the given the
 
07:29:44.230 --> 07:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
hour I and and the fact that you're
 
07:29:45.468 --> 07:29:45.478 align:start position:0%
going to be hearing more about this
 
07:29:47.670 --> 07:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
later I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
07:29:49.910 --> 07:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions the one thing I do want to do
 
07:29:53.990 --> 07:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
before I lose the the microphone here I
 
07:29:57.548 --> 07:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
I gave you copies of wet the wetlands
 
07:30:00.110 --> 07:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
permit application for forestry and the
 
07:30:03.070 --> 07:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
state best management practices for
 
07:30:05.788 --> 07:30:05.798 align:start position:0%
forestry a common misperception is that
 
07:30:07.430 --> 07:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's the wild west out there in the
 
07:30:10.990 --> 07:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
woods we're out there cutting wood and
 
07:30:13.468 --> 07:30:13.478 align:start position:0%
you know fire up the skitters let's go
 
07:30:16.030 --> 07:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
let's go cut some wood today boys we
 
07:30:16.040 --> 07:30:16.788 align:start position:0%
let's go cut some wood today boys we
have

07:30:16.788 --> 07:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:30:19.548 --> 07:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
regulations we have and there are
 
07:30:23.628 --> 07:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
multiple agencies that watch us we have
 
07:30:26.670 --> 07:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
Dees we have forest rangers through the
 
07:30:29.030 --> 07:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands we have a
 
07:30:31.350 --> 07:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
Timber we even have the the tax folks
 
07:30:32.990 --> 07:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
07:30:34.830 --> 07:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
Administration and the timber tax we
 
07:30:36.388 --> 07:30:36.398 align:start position:0%
have a the state has a Timber tax
 
07:30:39.430 --> 07:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
assessor who visits I would dare say
 
07:30:41.548 --> 07:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
almost every single Timber Harvest
 
07:30:44.308 --> 07:30:44.318 align:start position:0%
across the state um so we have a lot of
 
07:30:46.150 --> 07:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
people watching what happens in the
 
07:30:48.628 --> 07:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
woods they all know what the regulations
 
07:30:52.788 --> 07:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
are um although Dr Dr does not regulate
 
07:30:55.590 --> 07:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
or have jurisdiction over uh Wetlands
 
07:30:57.830 --> 07:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
rules they certainly interact and cross
 
07:30:59.350 --> 07:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
communicate with these others and if
 
07:31:01.548 --> 07:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
they see something going wrong they call
 
07:31:03.910 --> 07:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
up their friend at their their local
 
07:31:06.350 --> 07:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
forest ranger or Dees person and say hey
 
07:31:07.670 --> 07:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
I think you guys need to get out here
 
07:31:10.270 --> 07:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
there's a problem on the the stock Tree
 
07:31:12.708 --> 07:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
Farm we've got a real a real mess you
 
07:31:16.270 --> 07:31:16.280 align:start position:0%
need to come out so there are rules
 
07:31:19.350 --> 07:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
there are regulations in place and this
 
07:31:21.948 --> 07:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
this is absent Prime Wetlands we have a
 
07:31:23.910 --> 07:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
permit process we just went through the
 
07:31:26.270 --> 07:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
whole exercise with the es for the last
 
07:31:28.910 --> 07:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
several years updating that so there's a
 
07:31:31.468 --> 07:31:31.478 align:start position:0%
process in place and there is there's at
 
07:31:34.510 --> 07:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
least three agencies watching the shop
 
07:31:36.990 --> 07:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
adding another layer with prime wetlands
 
07:31:40.030 --> 07:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
and elevating that permit to a standard
 
07:31:42.788 --> 07:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
dredge and fill major project permit it
 
07:31:45.230 --> 07:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
just doesn't work for forestry you heard
 
07:31:47.670 --> 07:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
it from Ron I could parade in here
 
07:31:50.070 --> 07:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
another half dozen Foresters and they
 
07:31:52.708 --> 07:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
could all have their story about you
 
07:31:55.270 --> 07:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
know the Dame Tree Farm up in up in
 
07:31:58.070 --> 07:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
lonia Guilford near the airport where he
 
07:32:00.190 --> 07:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
had a Micro Burst blow down a bunch of
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
pine couldn't get to it because there
 
07:32:06.030 --> 07:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
was a prime Wetland between his log
 
07:32:09.628 --> 07:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
landing and where the the the the blow
 
07:32:11.788 --> 07:32:11.798 align:start position:0%
down Micro Burst hit and it was an old
 
07:32:14.230 --> 07:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
tote road but because it was a prime
 
07:32:17.110 --> 07:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
Wetland you know he couldn't get there I
 
07:32:19.388 --> 07:32:19.398 align:start position:0%
mean I could parade in folks to give you
 
07:32:21.868 --> 07:32:21.878 align:start position:0%
those stories I I'll spare you that I've
 
07:32:26.190 --> 07:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
gotten the calls I know them so again I
 
07:32:30.308 --> 07:32:30.318 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate your time um and I you
 
07:32:32.670 --> 07:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
know we'll continue I'm sure to continue
 
07:32:33.868 --> 07:32:33.878 align:start position:0%
to have this
 
07:32:37.350 --> 07:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
conversation but again I just would urge
 
07:32:41.150 --> 07:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
on this particular Bill to just vote itl
 
07:32:43.270 --> 07:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
and I think as was suggested earlier I
 
07:32:44.910 --> 07:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
think that you know it may be time to
 
07:32:46.468 --> 07:32:46.478 align:start position:0%
take a closer look at just Prime
 
07:32:49.788 --> 07:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
wetlands in general what is it you know
 
07:32:52.468 --> 07:32:52.478 align:start position:0%
with Dees and the level of scrutiny that
 
07:32:54.590 --> 07:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
they're out there doing now the wetlands
 
07:32:55.868 --> 07:32:55.878 align:start position:0%
laws have
 
07:32:58.430 --> 07:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
evolved well past what they were when
 
07:33:01.070 --> 07:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
this when this law came onto the books I
 
07:33:03.430 --> 07:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
think it may be time to ask the question
 
07:33:06.468 --> 07:33:06.478 align:start position:0%
what is the necessity of this um or is
 
07:33:08.670 --> 07:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
it really accomplishing is it truly the
 
07:33:11.788 --> 07:33:11.798 align:start position:0%
best of the best that's being protected
 
07:33:14.270 --> 07:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll I'll uh conclude my
 
07:33:16.070 --> 07:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd be happy to try to answer
 
07:33:16.080 --> 07:33:18.150 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd be happy to try to answer
any

07:33:18.150 --> 07:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:33:20.910 --> 07:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
 
07:33:20.920 --> 07:33:23.308 align:start position:0%
questions any questions by members of
the

07:33:23.308 --> 07:33:23.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:26.548 --> 07:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
07:33:31.070 --> 07:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
none just just checking are you all
 
07:33:34.190 --> 07:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
awake I've done that before I
 
07:33:36.110 --> 07:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
know thank you very much thank you for
 
07:33:36.120 --> 07:33:39.868 align:start position:0%
know thank you very much thank you for
your

07:33:39.868 --> 07:33:39.878 align:start position:0%

07:33:50.110 --> 07:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hackley representing division of force
 
07:33:53.190 --> 07:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
LS and do not say whether you support or
 
07:33:55.670 --> 07:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill that's correct chairman
 
07:33:59.590 --> 07:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
Rulo uh thank you uh and the members of
 
07:34:01.430 --> 07:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
the committee for the opportunity to
 
07:34:03.230 --> 07:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
speak um we do not have a formal
 
07:34:05.750 --> 07:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
position but I did want to offer some
 
07:34:08.350 --> 07:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
comments um so again my name is Patrick
 
07:34:10.350 --> 07:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hackley I'm the relatively new director
 
07:34:12.430 --> 07:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
for the division of forest and
 
07:34:15.270 --> 07:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
lands um and I did check with our forest
 
07:34:18.030 --> 07:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
management staff and we have had some
 
07:34:20.270 --> 07:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
challenges with uh Prime Wetlands laws
 
07:34:22.190 --> 07:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
that currently exists are the the
 
07:34:23.708 --> 07:34:23.718 align:start position:0%
ability of municipalities to Define
 
07:34:25.150 --> 07:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
their own Prime Wetlands so I'll just
 
07:34:27.708 --> 07:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
read some comments very broadly I won't
 
07:34:30.110 --> 07:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
get into um fingers toes heads and
 
07:34:33.388 --> 07:34:33.398 align:start position:0%
shoulders like my predecessor Jason St
 
07:34:35.030 --> 07:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
but we have encountered those those
 
07:34:36.468 --> 07:34:36.478 align:start position:0%
fingers and toes and the issues they
 
07:34:39.708 --> 07:34:39.718 align:start position:0%
cause in terms of forest management so
 
07:34:40.990 --> 07:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
as most of you know the division of
 
07:34:43.070 --> 07:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
forest and lands uh we're the state
 
07:34:44.868 --> 07:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
agency charged with the execution of all
 
07:34:47.388 --> 07:34:47.398 align:start position:0%
matters uh forestry uh in the
 
07:34:49.830 --> 07:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the state
 
07:34:52.468 --> 07:34:52.478 align:start position:0%
um as such we we support responsible
 
07:34:55.308 --> 07:34:55.318 align:start position:0%
Forest management obviously we are we
 
07:34:57.070 --> 07:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
need to be the standard bearers of good
 
07:34:59.788 --> 07:34:59.798 align:start position:0%
forestry on on public lands and we go
 
07:35:02.030 --> 07:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
through I think it's a 14-step process
 
07:35:05.910 --> 07:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
to plan our our tumber harvest in a very
 
07:35:08.030 --> 07:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
careful way with a
 
07:35:11.708 --> 07:35:11.718 align:start position:0%
um a team of of Forestry professionals
 
07:35:13.230 --> 07:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
Wildlife professionals and it's actually
 
07:35:14.990 --> 07:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
a two-year planning process before a
 
07:35:17.430 --> 07:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
machine even gets on the ground we've
 
07:35:20.350 --> 07:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
we've spent um time creating a report
 
07:35:22.308 --> 07:35:22.318 align:start position:0%
with with detailed maps of all the
 
07:35:24.270 --> 07:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas on that Forest before we
 
07:35:27.070 --> 07:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
even cut a stick of wood so it's a very
 
07:35:30.750 --> 07:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
um careful we we try to practice
 
07:35:33.468 --> 07:35:33.478 align:start position:0%
textbook forestry on state lands as we
 
07:35:36.030 --> 07:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
should um our concern with this bill is
 
07:35:37.868 --> 07:35:37.878 align:start position:0%
the unintended impacts it has to Forest
 
07:35:39.590 --> 07:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
management as has already been well
 
07:35:41.670 --> 07:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
articulated allowing these narrow strips
 
07:35:43.548 --> 07:35:43.558 align:start position:0%
to be designated as Prime Wetlands as
 
07:35:45.910 --> 07:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
the potential to impact the state's
 
07:35:47.628 --> 07:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
ability as well as private land owners
 
07:35:49.270 --> 07:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
ability to access portions of their
 
07:35:52.388 --> 07:35:52.398 align:start position:0%
property as as Jason Illustrated so well
 
07:35:55.910 --> 07:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
earlier um so in its current form
 
07:35:55.920 --> 07:35:57.468 align:start position:0%
earlier um so in its current form
enhancing

07:35:57.468 --> 07:35:57.478 align:start position:0%
enhancing
 
07:36:00.190 --> 07:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
this expanding the the definition of a
 
07:36:01.350 --> 07:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
prime Wetland through these narrow
 
07:36:03.430 --> 07:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
strips has has really created
 
07:36:05.308 --> 07:36:05.318 align:start position:0%
administrative burden for us we've had a
 
07:36:06.750 --> 07:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
couple of encounters with towns and
 
07:36:09.990 --> 07:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
we've had to um we worked things out uh
 
07:36:12.308 --> 07:36:12.318 align:start position:0%
but in one case where we did a a Timber
 
07:36:16.070 --> 07:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
Harvest about 15 years ago uh apparently
 
07:36:17.868 --> 07:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
at some point during that 15year period
 
07:36:19.830 --> 07:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
the town hired a a consultant who
 
07:36:21.990 --> 07:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
expanded the boundary of that that
 
07:36:24.548 --> 07:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
Wetland the prime Wetland um and we
 
07:36:26.990 --> 07:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
never got a notification until we we
 
07:36:30.468 --> 07:36:30.478 align:start position:0%
issued our um our intent to cut and uh
 
07:36:32.750 --> 07:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
our our notice of intent and they said
 
07:36:34.350 --> 07:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
well you can't have that Crossing there
 
07:36:36.230 --> 07:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
now because it's a prime Wetland I said
 
07:36:39.070 --> 07:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
well we you know so we worked it out DS
 
07:36:40.270 --> 07:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
came out we worked it out with our state
 
07:36:42.230 --> 07:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
Foresters but it it did stop you know
 
07:36:44.388 --> 07:36:44.398 align:start position:0%
stop the train and we had to have an
 
07:36:46.510 --> 07:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
education experience there so our
 
07:36:48.910 --> 07:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
forestry staff has encountered recent
 
07:36:50.190 --> 07:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
difficulties in the planning and
 
07:36:51.868 --> 07:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
execution of our harvesting operations
 
07:36:53.708 --> 07:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
on state reservations due to Prime
 
07:36:56.190 --> 07:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
Wetland designations Brading this
 
07:36:58.270 --> 07:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
definition has the St has the strong
 
07:37:00.030 --> 07:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
potential to increase those challenges
 
07:37:03.548 --> 07:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
for us so we are concerned that if this
 
07:37:06.830 --> 07:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
um expanded definition passes in uh in
 
07:37:08.388 --> 07:37:08.398 align:start position:0%
the in the new definition of a prime
 
07:37:10.548 --> 07:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
Wetland that not only the state but also
 
07:37:13.350 --> 07:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
private Forest land owners um are going
 
07:37:16.510 --> 07:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
to face another regulatory hurdle that
 
07:37:18.548 --> 07:37:18.558 align:start position:0%
um you know if if they it's kind of the
 
07:37:20.708 --> 07:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
death by a Thousand Cuts if they have
 
07:37:22.948 --> 07:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
another you know another thing they have
 
07:37:24.230 --> 07:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
to do to be able to cut wood on their
 
07:37:26.388 --> 07:37:26.398 align:start position:0%
land they may consider alternative uses
 
07:37:27.868 --> 07:37:27.878 align:start position:0%
that may be less desirable than growing
 
07:37:29.910 --> 07:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
trees and providing wildlife habitat
 
07:37:32.308 --> 07:37:32.318 align:start position:0%
which is what our division is all about
 
07:37:34.830 --> 07:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
and what we want to see uh be promoted
 
07:37:37.030 --> 07:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
going forward so with that I'll just
 
07:37:38.948 --> 07:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments and Happ to take
 
07:37:38.958 --> 07:37:40.190 align:start position:0%
conclude my comments and Happ to take
any

07:37:40.190 --> 07:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:37:43.548 --> 07:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
questions okay any uh comments or
 
07:37:46.150 --> 07:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
questions from or any any questions no
 
07:37:49.830 --> 07:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
comments just questions from the uh
 
07:37:51.750 --> 07:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
07:37:54.110 --> 07:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
07:37:58.270 --> 07:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:02.150 --> 07:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
you and finally last but not least Ari
 
07:38:09.708 --> 07:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:12.230 --> 07:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
builders good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
07:38:15.230 --> 07:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
07:38:17.948 --> 07:38:17.958 align:start position:0%
arri poock I'm with the fir Gallagher
 
07:38:20.270 --> 07:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
firm in conquer and registered lobbyist
 
07:38:23.070 --> 07:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Home Builders um
 
07:38:25.308 --> 07:38:25.318 align:start position:0%
like the others uh we also have added
 
07:38:27.670 --> 07:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
our voice to the corus year after year
 
07:38:29.830 --> 07:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
of opposing the bill I think it's three
 
07:38:33.750 --> 07:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
or four I know this H is going to uh you
 
07:38:35.150 --> 07:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
you'll have an oncore performance of
 
07:38:37.150 --> 07:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
this hearing later in the month or next
 
07:38:39.830 --> 07:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
month and I won't take any more time
 
07:38:41.830 --> 07:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
than necessary simply to State our
 
07:38:44.388 --> 07:38:44.398 align:start position:0%
position that uh wetlands are adequately
 
07:38:46.468 --> 07:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
protected in the state of New Hampshire
 
07:38:49.190 --> 07:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh there is already an onerous
 
07:38:52.150 --> 07:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh permitting process to affect and fill
 
07:38:54.830 --> 07:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh Wetlands for development uh there are
 
07:38:56.750 --> 07:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
already mitigation avoidance and
 
07:38:59.430 --> 07:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
minimization standards uh that put uh
 
07:39:02.270 --> 07:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
those permits uh on the top shelf and
 
07:39:04.948 --> 07:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
difficult to reach uh and Prime Wetland
 
07:39:06.990 --> 07:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
designations uh would simply put
 
07:39:09.270 --> 07:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
additional land off the table or farther
 
07:39:11.270 --> 07:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
from the table for development and so
 
07:39:13.388 --> 07:39:13.398 align:start position:0%
the home builders oppose uh those
 
07:39:15.548 --> 07:39:15.558 align:start position:0%
standards and believe that the state and
 
07:39:17.430 --> 07:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
its resources are adequately protected
 
07:39:19.430 --> 07:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
by the current state of the law
 
07:39:21.150 --> 07:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
I'll be back for the Encore performance
 
07:39:25.350 --> 07:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:27.830 --> 07:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
listening thank you very much any
 
07:39:30.350 --> 07:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
07:39:35.628 --> 07:39:35.638 align:start position:0%
committee I seeing none and looking at
 
07:39:39.070 --> 07:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
the time we uh I will
 
07:39:42.230 --> 07:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
adjourn 1227 excuse me I will not
 
07:39:43.910 --> 07:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
adjourn I will
 
07:39:43.920 --> 07:39:46.308 align:start position:0%
adjourn I will
continue

07:39:46.308 --> 07:39:46.318 align:start position:0%
continue
 
07:39:50.110 --> 07:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
1227 uh at a it will it will be it will
 
07:40:00.910 --> 07:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:08.948 --> 07:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:08.958 --> 07:40:14.190 align:start position:0%
 
up

07:40:14.190 --> 07:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:17.510 --> 07:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
up no n unless it becomes
 
07:40:17.520 --> 07:40:22.110 align:start position:0%
up no n unless it becomes
obvious

07:40:22.110 --> 07:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:27.110 --> 07:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
huh Jon is yeah let's let's talk
 
07:40:34.910 --> 07:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:34.920 --> 07:40:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
complicated

07:40:47.430 --> 07:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:47.440 --> 07:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
don't

07:41:02.000 --> 07:41:02.010 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:02.010 --> 07:41:05.788 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

07:41:05.788 --> 07:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:08.030 --> 07:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
why don't you why
 
07:41:10.468 --> 07:41:10.478 align:start position:0%
don't yeah
 
07:41:13.830 --> 07:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know I could ask I could ask
 
07:41:16.350 --> 07:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
Heather she could now that we got the
 
07:41:18.948 --> 07:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
the now that we have the draw why don't
 
07:41:25.230 --> 07:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:33.468 --> 07:41:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:37.388 --> 07:41:37.398 align:start position:0%
it GE I thought it was oh oh was what we
 
07:41:40.070 --> 07:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
had was all the
 
07:41:44.350 --> 07:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
bills oh we had all the 28 bills
 
07:41:47.230 --> 07:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
think no no those are all say no those
 
07:41:49.628 --> 07:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
are all 28 bills I
 
07:41:52.990 --> 07:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
think yeah they right they had today's
 
07:41:56.990 --> 07:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
they oh yeah oh yeah
 
07:41:59.708 --> 07:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
they yeah that was every
 
07:42:02.788 --> 07:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
bill yeah talk to you later I got to go
 
07:42:05.830 --> 07:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
