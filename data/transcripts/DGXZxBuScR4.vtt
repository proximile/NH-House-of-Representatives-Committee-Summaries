e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
since we're talking I think we will
 
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 align:start position:0%
start the
 
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.229 align:start position:0%
start the
[Laughter]

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
committee so Senator gray do you want to
 
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
bring up
 
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
your uh the senator gray would you like
 
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
to bring up your point from last time no
 
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh it was a a general comment about turn
 
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
on your microphone please thank it was a
 
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
general comment about how much detail we
 
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
should go into when we're talking about
 
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
modifying a fund and since we're not the
 
00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 align:start position:0%
policy committee I would like to see us
 
00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 align:start position:0%
maybe make a suggestion or two but that
 
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 align:start position:0%
the policy committee ought to be the one
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
that says yes we want to do this or no
 
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that that kind of
 
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
thing just a general comment keep us out
 
00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 align:start position:0%
of the weeds okay at representative
 
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
alies thank you on the reason this was
 
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.550 align:start position:0%
alies thank you on the reason this was
put

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
in uh this way was after many years of
 
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
experimentation uh because the policy
 
00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
committees would not look at their
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and they were putting in
 
00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
bills that said said that they were
 
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
going to do something that was already
 
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
in a dedicated fund and
 
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh and so I think
 
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we have a responsibility to address
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
to the policy committee that we think
 
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
this might make this dedicated fund work
 
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
or or and in the case of we think this
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
fund should go away because it doesn't
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
seem to be doing anything we could put
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
it in the bill and have the policy
 
00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 align:start position:0%
committee show
 
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
up yeah okay well we'll we'll before you
 
00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
yes represent Senator Grant yeah re
 
00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.270 align:start position:0%
yes represent Senator Grant yeah re
bottle

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh the when it's all in one bill the
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
bill isn't going to go to all of the
 
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 align:start position:0%
policy committees that may need to go
 
00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.949 align:start position:0%
policy committees that may need to go
okay

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 align:start position:0%
so you
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
know representative only if if we took
 
00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%
in some of these that we thought should
 
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
go to the policy committee and actually
 
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
wrote them as separate bills you know
 
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
coming out of this committee then we
 
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
could assure they went to the policy
 
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee before they came came back to
 
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
a finance committee again I I think that
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
there's ways we can do it you and I have
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
been on this committee what eight or 10
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
amen so so I may be I may be only half
 
00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
but you know eight or 10 years of
 
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
experience I think you know gives me a
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of right to to say a few
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
things that can I answer on I that that
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is a good solution if we think
 
00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
there is a specific change that ought to
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
be made that we write the bill and then
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
send it to them yeah so so I think when
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
we get to the bill stage you can Senator
 
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
gray or anyone else can certainly say
 
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
let's make this one a separate bill and
 
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
I don't see any problem with that I'm in
 
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
general in favor
 
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
of one one issue bills um more so than
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate seems to be but anyway
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
all right let's start with who's first
 
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.029 align:start position:0%

administrator great all right thank you
 
00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:41.879 align:start position:0%
commissioner go ahead okay so our first
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund is the municipal officers
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
and employees training fund um this fund
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
collects money from participants when a
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
small nominal fee when we provide
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
various training opportunities to
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
assessing officials Town official
 
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
officials Municipal officials that money
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
is then used to provide Refreshments for
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
long classes provide hard copy training
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
materials Etc we cannot keep more than
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
$5,000 in that fund so anything over
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
$5,000 that we have collected and has
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
have not spent will lapse at the end of
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
the year so that's why you will see that
 
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 203 the beginning balance
 
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 203 the beginning balance
was

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
$5,000 um we collected just over
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
$5,000 spent
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
$3,660 but the ending balance again goes
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
back to the 5,000 so it's just a fund
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
that we use for materials when providing
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
trainings we provide a number of
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
trainings over the course of the Year
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
everything from assessment review mini
 
00:08:52.509 --> 00:08:52.519 align:start position:0%
courses to multiple State statutes
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
rep representative Janan so the the U
 
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
other uses in this case
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
1405 um what what is so you have to
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
always get back to 5,000 how does that
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
get used
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
up that will lapse back to the to the
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
general fund the excess over 5,000 and
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
that 1405 is the excess that went back
 
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
you so why don't numbers in the book and
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
on the page
 
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
match I don't know actually um because
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
it looks like the the book only goes to
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 but um the memorandum we
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
provided also includes 24 so right the
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
the new book for 24 will have your new
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
numbers and I think it's just a
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
presentation difference I think that the
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
memo is not reflecting the laps in the
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
same way that the book is but the book
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
gets you back to the 5,000 so I think
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's just a presentation oh I see so
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
right because okay the in the book The
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
Other column is the lasts correct
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
correct I see
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
okay and and you suspended um these kind
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
classes during the pandemic is that what
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
happened we held the classes online as
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
much as possible but obviously those
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
classes don't have the printed materials
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the refreshments provided so
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
the cost in those years um were lower
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see our Revenue was lower in
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
those years as well we didn't charge um
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
as much as we normally would would but
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
yes that's the the 21 and 22 are direct
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
result of the pandemic any other
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
Al thank you uh how long has that 5,000
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
laps been in and does it create a
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
problem the 5,000 laps has been in as
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
long as I'm aware and I don't think it
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
creates a problem um that seems like the
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you all right let's go out to the next
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
one okay now page
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
285 this is the revenue information
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
management system fund also known as the
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
rims um Debt Service so when the
 
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
department received a
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
$3,160 th000 capital appropriation to
 
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
fund our new Revenue information
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
technology system or management system a
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
portion of that was to be paid back the
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
debt on that the principal and interest
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
was to be paid back with additional
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
Revenue that the system would
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
provide and the way that happens is per
 
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
statute the
 
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
Dr um with das's help uh transfers up to
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
$4 million of Revenue uplift every year
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
into this dedicated fund and then this
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
fund is used to pay the debt service
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we provide a memo every year to um
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
the capital project overview committee
 
00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
and the House and Senate Ways and Means
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
committees um relative to our
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
calculation of the revenue uplift um in
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
all of the last three years so fiscal
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
year 22 fiscal year 23 and fiscal year
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
24 we did generate Revenue uplift in
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
excess of the $4 million um but we only
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
trans ER up to that cap of 4 million we
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
will make these transfers into this
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund until the fund reaches or
 
00:12:42.189 --> 00:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
until we have transferred $40
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
million um that was the estimated
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
principal and interest that would needed
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
need to be paid on the debt that was to
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
be serviced by this Revenue uplift to
 
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
date in fiscal years 21 to 24 we have
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
deposited um just under 14 .2 million so
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
we have just over 25.8 million to go
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
assuming that we meet that $4 million
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
cap every year we will be doing this for
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
seven more
 
00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:13.959 align:start position:0%
years all right let me
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
ask if we're in debt here and we have a
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
balance in this fund why don't we pay
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
off the debt quicker than we would
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise so the debt services to is
 
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
provided to us by um treasury so those
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
are the numbers that provided to us and
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
I think that the timing of that and
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
those Amounts is based on the bonds that
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
were issued to service um to originally
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
fund the system and so the amounts that
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
we pay back are the principle and
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
interest that are coming due on those
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
bonds um as we move through the length
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
of the bond
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
period so maybe they're not callable or
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
whatever is that I yes okay
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
representative Jen again well I was just
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
wondering where the ending balance keeps
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
going up is is 4 million going in each
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
year too much should it be 3 million is
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
that going to is that ending balance
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
going to just keep going up if so then
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
it does four million make
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
sense that would I think be a question
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
for treasury as they have the full Debt
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
Service schedule we have asked them
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
multiple times to provide us with the
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
schedule but they have not done so um so
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
we only have what needs to be paid in
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
the next bium because that goes into our
 
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
budget but I do think the way the bonds
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
were they were not issued all at once
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
they were issued over a period of time
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
as we Dr needed to pay the invoices for
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
the capital project so I suspect there
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
will be a bit of like a bell curve where
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
there will be years where the expenses
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
are more than the 1.7 million that we've
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
seen to date um the up to $4 million a
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
year and a total of 40 million um those
 
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
amounts were done in conjunction with
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
treasury based on what they anticipated
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service schedule to be so that
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
would never leave us hopefully without
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
enough money in the fund to pay the debt
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
service but shouldn't produce um an
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
excess for long periods of time because
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
this money is coming right out of the
 
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
general fund into this dedicated fund
 
00:15:16.189 --> 00:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
you other yes represent Ming yeah what I
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
don't understand is this on this 40
 
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.350 align:start position:0%
don't understand is this on this 40
million

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
stays that in act that is it isn't being
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
taken away by treasury to pay
 
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
existing uh Co Bond
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
calls it will pay the service the
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
principal in interest on the bonds that
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
were used to fund the rims
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
project um I guess at the end when the
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
40 million has been entered into the
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
fund we will stop putting money into it
 
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
but the debt will there'll be debt that
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
will need to be paid beyond that point
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
in time we will be paying debt beyond
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
the seven years we're estimating it'll
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
take us seven years to fully fund the 40
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
million treasury will continue or we
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
will continue to pay the debt beyond
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
that point and then once the debt is
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
fully paid off I imagine the excess in
 
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund at that point would
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
go back to the general fund or we would
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
work with the legislature Treasury and
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
Das to essentially end this fund I'm
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going to call the treasurer
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
and ask for details on the
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
characteristics of those fonds
 
00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.790 align:start position:0%
characteristics of those fonds
and

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
um what's a would it make sense to to
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
transfer this fund to the
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
treasury that's an
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
interesting so when this was originally
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
set up um Dr had the dedicated fund to
 
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
pay the debt in our budget and treasury
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
because they had the debt service
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
schedule they had the payment of the
 
00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:56.839 align:start position:0%
principal and interest in their budget
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
the treasurer asked last year during the
 
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
last budget session to move the debt
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
service to our budget so we now have the
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and then we also have the
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
payment of the principal and
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
interest however I don't have the full
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
debt schedule so I only have what
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
treasury has provided which has been a
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
bium at a time so they are both here at
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
Dr yeah but I still lack visibility into
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
oh so you write checks to the bond
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
holders treasury does out of our account
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
I see so all right well I'll I'll call
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
them and get more details I all right
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee no
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner oh yes sorry uh Senator
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
Rose um is this going to be like the
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
mmis system which is going to cost us $2
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
million a year or whatever in
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
forever I hope not not um so I can give
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
you some more context so the rim system
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
was implemented fully implemented over a
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
course of three years it was on time on
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
budget through the pandemic which was a
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
pretty remarkable feat I think um then
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
through um additional funding with arpa
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
money we recently upgraded the system to
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
the most recent version and that will go
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
live uh the first weekend in October so
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
we are fully up todate with the solution
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's provided by our vendor fast
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
Enterprises we through our operating
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
budget we will fund hardware and
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
software maintenance and support going
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
forward in the next budget we will be
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
moving to a Cloud solution so we will no
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
longer hopefully moving to a Cloud
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
solution so we will no longer have
 
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
hardware and that will be fully
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
operationalized in our budget so there
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
will be no more additional Capital fund
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
funding that we will need and my goal is
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to evaluate going forward the various
 
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:07.640 align:start position:0%
version upgrades that are provided by
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
the vendor and make a decision at each
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
version upgrade whether or not it is
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
fatuous for New Hampshire to upgrade I
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
will say it is a commercial
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
off-the-shelf software it is used in
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
most other um Departments of Revenue
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
across the country however most of those
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
departments have an income tax a
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
personal income tax and a sales tax so I
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't imagine that we will do every
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
version upgrade there will be features
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
that will be added that just won't be
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
applicable to us and so we will evaluate
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
kind of moving forward what upgrades
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
look like for us but I can say as of the
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
first weekend in October we are on the
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
most current system version of the
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
system and so I don't anticipate large
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
costs um associated with this in the
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
next few years representative all me
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you can you remember
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
approximately how many million
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
we you this system H over the 4 million
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
has provided to the general
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
fund yes in the three years it's
 
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.590 align:start position:0%
fund yes in the three years it's
been

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus sure so in fiscal year 24 we
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
generated 14.5 million in Revenue uplift
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
and only transfer the 4 million so you
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
have 105 million
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
there um in fiscal year
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
23 we generated a total of 9 million but
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
only transferred the four so you have
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
another 5 million there so that's 15
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
in fiscal
 
00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:52.710 align:start position:0%
in fiscal
year

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
22 we were very close to the 4 million
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
exactly and then fiscal year 21 we
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
didn't reach the 4 million so over the
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
course we've generated an additional 15
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
million that has not been transferred
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
roughly what do you mean by that what is
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
revenue uplift great question so Revenue
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
uplift occurs in a few different ways
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
and the approach that that we've taken
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
to identifying this is revenue that we
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
believe would not have been able to have
 
00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
been recognized using our old outdated
 
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
system so the first example is remind to
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
pay letters so in our old system we sent
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
you a tax notice if you did not respond
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
to that tax notice after 80 Days you
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
went to collections and an individual
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
collector would make a phone call start
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
mailing letters Etc because of
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
Automation in the new system we send you
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
a tax notice and then in 30 days we send
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
you a reminder that you had received the
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
tax notice any money that's paid between
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
that reminder to pay letter and the 80
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
days when it would typically go to
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
collections we're counting that as
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift because that's
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
functionality that we didn't have before
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
it certainly saves our collector's time
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
because this money this debt isn't being
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
sent to them so that generated a total
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
of 5.4 million doll in fiscal 24 and
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
then the um another area where we have
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue uplift is through the use of
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
federal tax information from the IRS the
 
00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
IRS has very stringent requirements
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
ments around the security of the
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
information and our old system did not
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
meet the security requirements necessary
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
to really use the IRS information in the
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
most efficient manner so with the new
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
system being fully secured meeting all
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the security requirements we can
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
better utilize that information that
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
generated $7 million last year and the
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
last is we now allow taxpayers through
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
our online portal to um do essentially
 
00:23:03.149 --> 00:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
automated payment plans they can easily
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
enter into a payment plan if it meets
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
certain requirements that we've put in
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
place it does not have to go for
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
approval um and so that's an efficiency
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
certainly and that generated just under
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
2 million last year all right thank you
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
so at the re I I'm uh in danger of
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
getting Senator
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
gray by getting too much detail here so
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
let's go on to Department of Information
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:37.789 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
right all right so this is Page what
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
page page one page
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
one I don't know how we got that honor
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
but so good morning Mr chair um and
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
record uh my name is Dennis goule I'm
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
Information Technology olog and with me
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
today is is our Director of Finance Rose
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
Curry um we're here to talk about our uh
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
our Telecom dedicated fund and I I'll
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
I'll go over the um you can see in in in
 
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
the letter the table a and and the fund
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
balances and things like that I'm going
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
to go over kind of in in as much
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
layman's terms as I can what the fund is
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
is what its purpos is and what its
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
financial status is uh now and what we
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
expect it to be over the years um
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
essentially the the Telecom fund is is
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
covering really um three major areas one
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
is the voice
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
Communications uh for the Executive
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
Branch the other is the uh is networking
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
and that's two parts so I'm bre you know
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
of the three parts there two of them are
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
networking one is what we call wide area
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
network that connects the you know 400
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
or so locations that we're servicing
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
around the state um anything from a do
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
shed to a you know to a liquor store to
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
a you know to a DHHS uh district office
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
or or any other district office from
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
from an agency so there um and then the
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
other network is the one that we um that
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
sits inside the uh agency locations that
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
our employees connect
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
to um essentially this was designed so
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we over collect over time a little
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
bit just just enough to keep the the
 
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.190 align:start position:0%
bit just just enough to keep the the
equipment

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
dated um and and supportable and and
 
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
what that means really is that because
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh of many of the compliance
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
requirements we have to upgrade the
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
equipment as soon as pretty close to
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
when it's end of life or when it's end
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
of support because we will no longer get
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
cyber security um updates for said
 
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
equipment so it's really important that
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
we keep that equipment um uh up to date
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
and and so we strive to to have the uh
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
particularly the network equipment in
 
00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:05.389 align:start position:0%
particularly the network equipment in
our

00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
locations um in a you know it's about a
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
six to sevene window that it has to be
 
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.389 align:start position:0%
six to sevene window that it has to be
replaced

00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
um we we have a rate card that that is
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
part of the the budget planning process
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
each bium during the nine plus years
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
I've been here the rate card has stayed
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
almost the same during that time so it's
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
it's although you see other parts of my
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
budget uh have gone up over time we've
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
kept the rate card pretty flat uh during
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
that period in fact uh we expect it to
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
go down um in in this banial budget
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
planning um so so you look at the the
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
growth of the fund and it looks like
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's started to grow a lot and that
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
is true and there's a and it it it turns
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
out to be a performant and reliable
 
00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
Network it's a musthave so um
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
additionally we're in the trans
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
transition today between the kind of old
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
style telepan and the fully converged
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
telefony so what's old style telephony
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know you got your phone on your desk
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
you have one wire that goes to that
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
phone uh the the the more modern
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
telefony would be uh in fact I I've got
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
an example of it right now I have two
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
phone numbers on this my state phone one
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
of them is my mobile number and the
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
other's my desk number I don't have a
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
desk phone anymore so we're we have some
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
expensive that we're accumulating um in
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
the millions uh in to um leverage that
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
transition over time as well and um and
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
lastly this uh this arpa money that
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
transitioned the network in another uh
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
few years we're three years into that
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
project now and another few years we'll
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
be in the maintenance of of all of that
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
equipment and we'll start the process
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
all over again our so so I feel like
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
that although it looks like we may be
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
over collecting here I don't feel that's
 
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
the case I feel like we're being pretty
 
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
responsible with with the this funding
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
because we're really striving to keep
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
the long-term
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
collections um somewhat close as close
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
as possible to the long-term
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
requirements of the state in the areas
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
that we're covering with this fund and
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh the the other thing I other thing I
 
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
really like about this model it's it's a
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
small part part of my budget but one of
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
the things I really like about it is it
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
it transitions from a what could be a
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
really bumpy model like imagine I'm
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
coming to you every six years and asking
 
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
for $34.5 million I don't have to do
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
that here I collect I keep a pretty flat
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
rate card for the agencies and then we
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't have those big um Financial
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
impacts every few years uh so that
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
concludes my formal testimony uh happy
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
to answer any question from the
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
repres Senator Rosen thank you I'm just
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
curious how you get two phone numbers on
 
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
one phone because well well actually
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
Verizon tells me I can't do that I
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
misspoke I actually have three phone
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
numbers on this but but and my I
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
actually have two phone numbers on my
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
personal phone because um so there's a
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
couple ways one is you you can get two
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
phone numbers on the more newer phones
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
because they have these the the Sim
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
yeah eim so if you had a physical Sim
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
and an eim that's two numbers uh on my
 
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
personal phone I have two numbers
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
because I have the number that came from
 
00:29:39.149 --> 00:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
Verizon I also have my old home number
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
so I don't have a phone at home anymore
 
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
my home number rings on my personal
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
phone because I got I ported it over to
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
an app I'm I'm being geeky here but
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's how I did I ported it over to an
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
app and I have the app on the phone and
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
so somebody calls my old personal home
 
00:29:55.789 --> 00:29:55.799 align:start position:0%
number it rings on my personal cell
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
phone okay well we can take this
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
softline I'm happy to help you with that
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
so does the committee have any questions
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
about the dedicated
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
fund all right I'll ask you so um this
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
fund covers not just equipment which
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
would make sense to me because
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
effectively you're depreciating that
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
equipment and you want to store money to
 
00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
to replace it but it also has salaries
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
for a considerable number of people
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
right over 15 fulltime correct so does
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
that make sense or should that simp be
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted and not part of this fund um
 
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
well you know it's I I haven't really
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
thought about that it's just been how
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's been and you know I inherited the
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
fund from Department of Safety I think
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
in uh 2016 or 17 and at the time they
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
you know they were funding the staff
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
that supports the network and the
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
telepan so it really you know if you
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
look at it it's a it's a nice bundle it
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
says here's what we're here's what we're
 
00:30:58.509 --> 00:30:58.519 align:start position:0%
spending on that so certainly we're not
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
over collecting on salaries um we're you
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
know we're just looking at that as as um
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
not an accumulation thing so the
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
accumulating part of the fund really is
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
for the equipment and and stuff that is
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
ephemeral and the uh and then the the
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits I think makes
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
sense in the sense that they are aligned
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
mission of the four to five million
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
annual expenses how much of that is
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
salary and
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
benefit 15 people well that's a that's a
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
question I didn't prepare for so I we
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
can we can get back to that with ASAP
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
with that answer but I I don't have that
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
on the top I guess I'm guessing it's
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
less than half but I'm not sure yeah I'm
 
00:31:42.629 --> 00:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
guessing you know it's it's they're
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
they're fairly High you know for State
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
uh they're fairly highly compensated
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
because they're Network engineers and
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
things like that so I'm but I'd hate to
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
throw out a number now that isn't
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
correct so maybe you can get us that as
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
an as a separate column or something
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I think related
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
to this uh who decides
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
on on the spending in this dedicated
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
fund is it just you and executive
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
Council or does the the do the finance
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
committees have a say in this good
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
question um so we we uh we have an appro
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
A banal appropriation
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
um which is um you know been been been
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
around $8 or $9 million a year over the
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
time I've been here and then if we have
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
extra expenditures beyond that
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation like a large expenditure
 
00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
say to do the the data center Network
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
ring that we're going to have to be
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
doing soon we would then take that to
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
the executive Council and they would e
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
approve it or not but but I've never um
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
gone to fiscal committee for that uh
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because that's the only
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
situation where I don't go to the Joint
 
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
situation where I don't go to the Joint
fiscal

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
page the page
 
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
yeah more up to right all right thank
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
you very much Miss Kelly uh good morning
 
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh Heather Kelly director of operations
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
and expenditures for the boards uh the
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated non-aps fund was reestablished
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
2023 so the lapsing funds that you see
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
underneath other sources were the funds
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
that used to lapse to the general fund
 
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh oplc uh is able to collect up to $5
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
million in that dedicated fund once it
 
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
reaches $5 million the agency is then
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
required to readjust fees uh the agency
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
is statutorily not allowed to collect
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
more than
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
125% the agency's goal is to have all
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
boards collect 100% of their expenditure
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
so that no boards are subsidizing other
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
boards the
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
yep representative slow slow down a bit
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't think any of this is in
 
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.630 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't think any of this is in
there

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay collect more than statutorily we're
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
not allowed to collect more more than
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
125% right yeah it used to be
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
right all the extra would lapse to the
 
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
general fund but because we sort of
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
broke them off into a separate fund then
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh their goal is now to be 100% right
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
and not collect not overcharge uh
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
professionals so that is correct go
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
ahead yes
 
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
the the second fund is our Prof let's
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
let's wait let's see if we have
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
questions on on this
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
one Senator rosenan thank you
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
so are all of your
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
boards now just collecting
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
100% of their expenses in fees currently
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
we have boards that are collecting less
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
than 100% uh and then we do have boards
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
that are grossly collecting more than
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
the 100% and subsidizing the other
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
boards we are currently in the process
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
of evalu Val ating those figures and we
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
will be adjusting fees
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
accordingly yes follow could you give us
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
an idea how many are under collecting
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
and how many are over collecting I would
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
say about half of it's about split so
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
the larger boards are collecting more
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
revenue and subsidizing so the larger
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
boards would be medicine Pharmacy um and
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
then some of the smaller boards are
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
collecting less than 100% but we have
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
those figures previously for analysis
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
that we did a few years ago and we can
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
certainly get that analysis over to you
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh but we do have those figures from
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
2022 thank you you're
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
welcome yes uh represent wer is the
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
reason for the smaller boards under
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
collecting is because there's so few
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
getting those licenses I remember you
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
had at sometimes as few as 40 people
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
with a license correct the agency does a
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
cost allocation based on number of
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
lenses so that can sometimes drive up
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
their or drive down some would overpay
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
based on the number um and so it depends
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
on the number of lenses that's how we
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
evaluate that figure yes because some of
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
those smaller boards it would be a
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
ridiculous cost thousands of dollars a
 
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:51.800 align:start position:0%
year for a license correct and we then
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
we look at that and evaluate it and then
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
adjust the fee appropriately so they
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
aren't paying thousands of dollarss
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
and I think the reason that we put all
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
of them in your board or your commission
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
was because you could balance those
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
things or you had the smaller ones that
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would have to charge
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
ridiculous prices for a license so I'm
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
not I'm not upset by that because I
 
00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
think that was designed thank
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
you other question representative Al
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I remember quite some time ago
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
actually we redid All of the small
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
medical boards in Ways and Means before
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
it was taken away from us and given
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere else um the on there I think
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
it was assistance to optometrists that
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
had their own group and they were being
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
paid obviously a lot less than anybody
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
else do you did that go into the
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
calculation too and the The Midwives may
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
have been a problem
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
too in that a number of factors uh we
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
take in ly counts additionally we have
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
taken into enforcement counts uh number
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
of complaints that are brought in and so
 
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
that we can properly allocate that cost
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
across all boards as some boards do not
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
generate as many enforcement complaints
 
00:40:17.069 --> 00:40:17.079 align:start position:0%
as others so we have uh expanded the
 
00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:20.270 align:start position:0%
as others so we have uh expanded the
analysis

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately yeah and you dumped
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
out uh the um
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
board for manufactured housing entirely
 
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
I believe we still have the board of
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer you do yes oh good are you
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining the spreadsheet uh the uh um
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
what do you call it the
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
website because that was extremely
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
important to not having that problem
 
00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:55.630 align:start position:0%
important to not having that problem
resurface

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
again I think I may may be able to
 
00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
clarify so there were two separate
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
functions there's the board for the
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
installers of manufactured housing that
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
board still exists at the oplc because
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
it is a a licensing function for the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
installers okay there additionally there
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
was a complaint board yes that was
 
00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:17.079 align:start position:0%
housed at the
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
oplc that was that board was removed but
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
I believe and Heather can correct me the
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
function remains still with the office
 
00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:29.390 align:start position:0%
function remains still with the office
although

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes that that's that's how I will leave
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
it so there is still a process and the
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
collection of complaints to the office
 
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
but there's no board that does those
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
similarly that I don't I don't have a
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
special board for complaints for any
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
other licensing board it comes to the
 
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
office through the enforcement process
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
but that is a newer change so that that
 
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
actual functionality on the ground is is
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
still um being developed within the
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
office so is is that what you were
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
referring to the complaint board I could
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
get clarity uh there was a website which
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
put up the results of resolution of
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
complaints and that website allowed
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
people in manufactured housing to go and
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
and the owners of it to go to the
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
website and find out for that particular
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance they had worked themselves
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
out of a
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
job because they had answered just about
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
every question you could have about
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh communal
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
living and um and but they they could go
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
to that and see what the board had
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
decided was the best way to handle this
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then gone to the opposite party and
 
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.190 align:start position:0%
and then gone to the opposite party and
said

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
look oh and and they would fix it
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
themselves yeah I think we can if that
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
no longer exists then we will probably
 
00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:57.319 align:start position:0%
have a problem in 20 years unless all
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing boards outside of
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
of the um Community Loan Fund uh
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
disappear I I believe that one of the
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
bills vetoed by the governor had to do
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the board of manufactured housing
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
oh really and so I think that'll come up
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
on veto day so that that that bill that
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
was vetoed was specifically there it was
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
to create several advisory boards that
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
are current that are currently licensing
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
boards so that would be the the
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
installers so the veto was the Bill had
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
proposed to make the installers
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
licensing board and Advisory Board
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
office um that had passed the
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
legislature and has been VTO by the
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
governor so I guess in a few weeks you
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
will take that up that is still again
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
separate from the complaint that that
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
you're speaking of and I we definitely
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
can look into what I'm sure those
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
decisions could be integrated into our
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
website where we have other enforcement
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
actions or other decisions that were
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
made um I can't confidently say they
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
solved all the problems I think there
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
were a number of challenges as for why
 
00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
they were not meeting why complaints
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
were not getting to them um but yes
 
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
we're working on establishing the new
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
process and I I I think your your point
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
is well taken about having those
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
decisions live somewhere on our website
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
y thank you other questions about this
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
oh oh oh no no you already answered that
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
at the beginning what sources on they
 
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
are their lapses to the general right go
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
ahead uh the second uh dedicated find
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
sorry could I just I just turn represent
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
and I put the things on here on just uh
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
to let you know the um SB 409 was
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
actually HB 409
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
it and I guess that was the main thing I
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
you go ahead okay uh the second uh
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund is for our professional
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
health program for uh our typ right now
 
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
for our medical boards this fund is used
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh for uh
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
the health boards for anyone that is
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
impaired or has substance abuse issues
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh they can
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
self-report uh to us and then or through
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
the enforcement process will be referred
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
to this program the um
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
account has been showing in the negative
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
the agency prior to me was collecting a
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
fee that didn't cover the cost we've
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
since raised it
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
twice um this final adjustment should
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
now be covering the fund moving
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
forward uh this is contracted with the
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire professionals health
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
program at a cost of
 
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.829 align:start position:0%
program at a cost of
86,87

00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
86,87
 
00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:19.390 align:start position:0%
86,87
uh

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
year so why is this a separate fund and
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
not part of your main fund this is used
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
exclusively just for that contract
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
um there is an RSA 310 that requires us
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
to have this dedicated fund for this
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific purpose okay uh Senator Ros
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a couple of
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
the topics of health conditions covered
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
by this fund have
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
expanded over the time I've been in the
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
legislature used to be alcohol and drug
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
use and now
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
includes cognitive decline so um it's
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
expanded a bit but what I've heard is
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
that lower paid health professionals and
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
I'm specifically thinking of like
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
lnas really can't afford the
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket costs of
 
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
treatment um and my understanding is
 
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
that this program really is monitoring
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it doesn't provide treatment
 
00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
for any of these issues so I guess my
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
question is has your agency
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
considered variable fees so that and it
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
not everybody is paying
 
00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
$28 fee for a
 
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.309 align:start position:0%
$28 fee for a
license

00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
which hits someone making $11 an hour
 
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
harder than some orthopedic surgeon
 
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:06.990 align:start position:0%
harder than some orthopedic surgeon
making

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
$800,000 a year I just wonder if we
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
could do do
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a better job with this incredibly
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
important program because we don't want
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
to lose these licensed professionals we
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
want them to get
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
recovery kids stay with it and I just
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
wonder where your agency is
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
on fitting the fees to the ability yes
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh we have proposed variable fees to all
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
the boards indicating in
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh professionals at the higher levels
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
apn's RN's doctors even in the
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
electricians groups when they're master
 
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.230 align:start position:0%
electricians groups when they're master
electrician

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
electrician
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
Master to pay more than the apprentices
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
or the lnas so we have proposed that to
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
the boards uh and we will be looking
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
into that additionally we are looking
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
for grant money to offset the LNA cost
 
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.030 align:start position:0%
for grant money to offset the LNA cost
as

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
well you're
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
welcome so is this fee up to you or is
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
it is there a board that decides it this
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
fee is up to the agency based on the
 
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
contracted price so that we can cover
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
the price so you
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
could exceed to um Senator rosen's
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
request right away if you wanted to yeah
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
would have to go through the rul making
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
process but yes we could adjust the fee
 
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:39.910 align:start position:0%
process but yes we could adjust the fee
all

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
right and so you plan to do so is that
 
00:49:46.109 --> 00:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
we are considering adjusting fees
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner I I guess my question was
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh did you mean the fee specifically
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
that is for this fund or licensing fees
 
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
in general this fund this F okay so a
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
different question than licensing fees I
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
understand it's
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
$28 added to the licensing Fe but it
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
falls differently
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
upon different kinds of licenses $8 per
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay is this $28 a year is that what
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about or $28 every two
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
years every two
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
years okay represent Welling yeah and
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
and so the the
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
$28 is something everybody
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
pays everyone pays for any board that is
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes so there are other fees for their
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
license in general correct lnas
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
currently pay $63 that is the $28 per
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
PHP fee along with their licensing fee I
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
see okay so I think Senator rosenal has
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
a good point here yeah all right
 
00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.630 align:start position:0%
a good point here yeah all right
thank

00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
you all right yeah thank you sen other
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions yeah Senator gray that was the
 
00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.150 align:start position:0%
questions yeah Senator gray that was the
one

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
I yes I I have some one myself so yeah
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead Senator gray back on page
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
68 back on page 68 we have another fund
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
there's a note down there that says
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to make modifications to it
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
I've lost track of it so I don't know
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
why we're not talking about it here so
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
back to you guys that's the real estate
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
appraisers board fund that you can speak
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
to the repeal that was repealed uh in
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
2023 and also on that note down there it
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
says that you're going to request a new
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
fund for investigation or something what
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
that last paragraph before the signature
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
part right book reflects the submission
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
that was made last year um I don't know
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
we we did not create a dedicated fund
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
for enforcement it may have predated you
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
I don't know how it might have been a
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
her predecessor but we can if you're
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
going to do it I'd like to to know
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
before we write our report so I don't
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
think you have any plans to request any
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
new dedicated funds that we know of so
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
we won't worry about it unless you get
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
back to us I I wonder if that was a
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
request before the entire office had a
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund if that the reason I ask
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
is that the transfer of the stuff from
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
the assessing Standards Board to you
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
guys apparently has not gone as smoothly
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
as I would have hoped okay and in fact I
 
00:52:57.829 --> 00:52:57.839 align:start position:0%
don't even know if the new
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
board associated with you guys is up and
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
running and and fully staffed and all
 
00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799 align:start position:0%
that yet and so just I'm sensitive when
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
I see things that uh that deal with real
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
estate and the division between Dr and
 
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.309 align:start position:0%
estate and the division between Dr and
you

00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
guys yeah so Heather can speak to the
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
fees uh specifically I can say actually
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
that the certification of assessor board
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
is meeting tomorrow morning so it it is
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
up and running it is staffed uh
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steph and I will both be
 
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:27.430 align:start position:0%
commissioner Steph and I will both be
there

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
um myself to introduce myself so that
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
that is um operating and I and I think
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
the there were a few bills over a few
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
years back and forth of moving all of
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
that over leaving just the certification
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the lure piece with the office but
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
leaving other parts of it with Dr so
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
that that was a policy decision so um we
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
just have the certification piece but
 
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
that is operational so and then the fee
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
piece Heather can speak to so the fee as
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh we generate uh we take in the federal
 
00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the fee so instead of having
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund the agency has an
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
account where we deposit those funds
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
into so that we can properly track those
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
as those are not our funds as we are
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
invoiced by the federal government to
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
pay out those funds so we do have those
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
designated separately so that we can
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
distinguish and pay appropriately and
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we're generating the correct
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
amount thank you you're
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
welome so the thing I wanted to talk to
 
00:54:30.349 --> 00:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
you about was um on Tuesday we met with
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of educ met Department of
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
Education I'm sorry on Monday yeah on
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
Monday we met with the Department of
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
Education for some reason I think today
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
is Thursday that's my problem all right
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and they have an they have a fund uh
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund for the board of lure of
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
interpreters for the de and heart of
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
hearing and so we discussed that this
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
board and this fund might be better
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
handled by
 
00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.270 align:start position:0%
handled by
oplc

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
because it has annual revenues of
 
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
$30,000 plus and annual expenses of
 
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.190 align:start position:0%
$30,000 plus and annual expenses of
about

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
seven okay so so they are not at all
 
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
balanced and it it now has a it's got a
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
growing balance in this fund now up to$
 
00:55:19.079 --> 00:55:21.510 align:start position:0%
growing balance in this fund now up to$
280

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
280
 
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.270 align:start position:0%
280
$228,000

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
$228,000
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
so you know I I was it it occurred to me
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe you could handle this in a
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
better way um I can I can speak very
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
briefly to that not from my tenure in
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
the office but from my time in other
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
various roles in the legislative and
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
executive branches um there was some
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about that so there are a few
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
still existing certification or
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
licensure functions that are not with
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
the office that are still with other um
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
various agencies that being one of them
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
obviously teachers in general is another
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
one that's with the Department of
 
00:55:55.799 --> 00:55:57.069 align:start position:0%
one that's with the Department of
Education

00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
and um I believe there's um security
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
agents uh that are still at the
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety I think because
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's firearm safety and certification
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
that that policy decision has been to
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
leave it there so there was some
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about the interpreters board
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
specifically should that slide over that
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's just a licenser function and the
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement should that slide over to
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
the office um during a conversation with
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and I'm happy to talk more
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
offline if you'd like uh there was not
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
an appetite for that and so I it was not
 
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
moved forward but there there was some
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
initial discussion about that and it was
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
met with significant
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
resistance but if if the legislature
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that policy decision that
 
00:56:43.029 --> 00:56:43.039 align:start position:0%
would that being overcharged by a factor
 
00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:46.359 align:start position:0%
of three or so you know so I I and I
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
imagine the uh the cost would be very
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
different within the oplc structure than
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
education so I'm not sure the 7,000
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
would hold but also we wouldn't be able
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
to charge them more than 25% when it
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
fell in our calculation and um yeah we
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't have enough data I think to really
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
estimate what that cost would be
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
but if H the legislature decided to move
 
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
it we would take it yeah I didn't get
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
any objection from the commissioner of
 
00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
Education no that would not be the
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder I was referring to I see yes
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
all right well yeah if you could send me
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
an email or something we'll we'll talk
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
about this yep separately other
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
questions no all right thank you very
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
much so last what do we have here this
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:47.180 align:start position:0%
energy oh there's one that's off book it
 
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.829 align:start position:0%
energy oh there's one that's off book it
[Laughter]

00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
says let see what page that
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
is okay all right hold on a moment
 
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.789 align:start position:0%
is okay all right hold on a moment
commissioner

00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.349 --> 00:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.359 --> 00:58:17.390 align:start position:0%
 
234

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
yep page
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.309 --> 00:58:39.319 align:start position:0%
71 I don't really understand why it's
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
off book this is a very large amount I
 
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
think that comes in and does that it
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
sure it looks like but yeah we we'll
 
00:58:48.359 --> 00:58:49.109 align:start position:0%
sure it looks like but yeah we we'll
find

00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Department of eny energy
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me good morning Mr chairman
 
00:59:45.910 --> 00:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
Joshua Elliot uh Elliott is spelled with
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
two L's and two T's uh I serve as the
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
Director of the division of policy and
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:01.039 align:start position:0%
okay all right so let's start with this
 
01:00:02.589 --> 01:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
fund number
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
71 sure so with the electric assistance
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
program which is funded by the systems
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
benefits charge uh which is found in
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
statute it's a result of uh
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
restructuring many years ago um the
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
electric assistance fund uh provides a
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
bill discount for lowincome households
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
on their electric bill um the total cost
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
to the systems benefits charge I believe
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
is about um 1 12 Ms per kilowatt hour um
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
of electricity used um so that every
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
utility customer pays this charge um and
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the program just to let you know
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
that it does align with li Heap so uh
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
households making up to 60% of State
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
median income uh can apply for this
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
program um happy to answer any questions
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
you might have about the
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
details yes well just why don't you
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
start with why is lately the expenses
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
been so much higher than the
 
01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
revenues I'll have Josh speak to
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question Mr
 
01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:15.039 align:start position:0%
chairman so a function of the uh of the
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
uh electric assistance program and how
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
it is structured um it is very sensitive
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
to Electric prices so the actual
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
individual um per kilowatt hour price of
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
electricity um so is you see electricity
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
prices increase um the uh as well as
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
enrollment um so we know with the last
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years um with the increase in
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
electricity prices there were more
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
people who were interested in the
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
program so we had more applicants coming
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the door um so that both drives um
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
the that drives the expenditure side uh
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
the fund itself um is a self-balancing
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
fund so the utilities will deposit
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
whatever they collect into the fund and
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
then withdraw whatever they need to be
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
able to meet the benefits for the uh um
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
program participants in their respective
 
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
utility service territories so it's self
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
balances so some some months they may
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
make a deposit to the fund some months
 
01:02:10.029 --> 01:02:10.039 align:start position:0%
that may be a negative um or may be a
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from the fund and it sort of
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
balances out is on a monthly basis so as
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
we see electricity prices increase we'll
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
see the revenues um we'll see the
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures in increase um as we've
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
seen um prices come down we've seen the
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures decrease
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
and and roughly 30,000 households were
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled in the this previous uh or this
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
year and representative
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
Jan um thank you for taking our
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
so from 22 to 23 am I to assume by the
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
expenses that there was a fairly large
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
increase in rates and then from 23 to 24
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
electric rates dropped yes that that's
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
correct so um the war in Ukraine uh
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
spiked the price of natural gas you know
 
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
more than half of the electricity
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
generated in the region is generated by
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
natural gas um so obviously you may
 
01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:09.559 align:start position:0%
remember that the prices of default
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
Service uh did really Spike um I believe
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
eversource in that time period was
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
around 22 cents per kilowatt hour um so
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
basically it it doubled um and now
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
prices have come down as the prices of
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas have come down um
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
okay so that that's why you see that
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
that change thank
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
you representa I think I missed a number
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
did you say there were only 30
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
households in this 30,000 households
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
30,000 thank
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
you and uh 60% of income means what of
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
median income in New Hampshire or yes
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
so in the sorry are you you're not done
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and there are the other two
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
programs each seem to have a low and
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
moderate part to
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
them how do they
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
collaborate I'm sorry I which other two
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
programs are you referring
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
to um are you referring to fuel
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
assistance and the weatherization
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
s on not the site committee oh I got
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
these unattached to each other the
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:45.549 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
fund

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
and and the renewable energy fund each
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
have some some piece that they're
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
putting into low in moderate income
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
does it just flow to the
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
SBC one or um no so there's a couple of
 
01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
different programs that are designed um
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
around that same um low moderate income
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
definition uh the uh the renewable
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
energy fund uh uses 80% of area median
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
income which is a slightly different
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
metric that's usually used at the
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
federal level uh it's also the um
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
threshold to qualify for subsidized
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
housing so for example if you live in a
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
public housing authority or something or
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
similar properties um on the uh Energy
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund uh that is also aligned
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
with 60% of State median income those
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
programs are uh managed by the utilities
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire saves program
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
um and they also work collaboratively
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
with the Community Action agencies um
 
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
who also do um the intake work for this
 
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
program as well so there is there is
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
overlap and efficiencies in terms of f
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
coming in the door and being a being
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
able to be eligible for programs with
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
one application rather than um having to
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
go through the same process multiple
 
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
times and then that administrative cost
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
that goes along with that as well is it
 
01:06:10.029 --> 01:06:10.039 align:start position:0%
also related to heating
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
energy yes indirectly so the electric
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
assistance program for this particular
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund um it there the Community
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
Action agencies share one common
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
application among across the entire
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
state for all three programs so if
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in the door is looking
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
for assistance they may not necessarily
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
they may think oh I need help on my
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
electric bill there's one place they can
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
sort of check off the box and they can
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
they can be uh apply with one form for
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.269 --> 01:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
programs so people could get get
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
assistance from all three of
 
01:06:44.119 --> 01:06:46.230 align:start position:0%
assistance from all three of
them

01:06:46.230 --> 01:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes oh and could I just ask area income
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's a source sport spot in lean in
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in Grafton County on does
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
the is the area the county is the area
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
which means that Lebanon doesn't qualify
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh that is that is an excellent question
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative because this is something
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
we've we've been working through with
 
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh uh programs in the
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
agency so area median income uh they
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
default to the um us uh Housing and
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
Urban Development so HUD numbers um how
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
those maps are drawn I I see you've run
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
into a similar problem in the Upper
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
Valley it doesn't necessarily make sense
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
if you're here on the ground um but
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's uh some of them are done there's
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
entire counties that are in the same one
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
and there's some where there are
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
communities that are areas together that
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
are in a different one you go over the
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
Town Line and you have a different set
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
of numbers to use so it's the HUD
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
definition yes so yes so we we do not
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
have any Authority time trying to get
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
them to fix yes that is something
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we do not have any
 
01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
authority over neighboring towns can be
 
01:07:57.309 --> 01:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
in two different yeah
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I'm concerned with this fund
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
that in 20 between 2020 and
 
01:08:07.589 --> 01:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
20122 it looked relatively under control
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
right and and then 23 and
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
24 it it was really drained and we had
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
to add 1.9 million of General funds so
 
01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with either how
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're allocating money to go in or
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
paying too much to go out such that
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
there's a problem where where we have to
 
01:08:31.709 --> 01:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
use General funds which we don't want to
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
do I don't think if if I could add to
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
2024 uh this was part of a $9
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
million extra uh appropriation from your
 
01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:57.709 align:start position:0%
million extra uh appropriation from your
committee

01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
again there was my point is in 2024 or
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
whatever we we felt like we had a lot of
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
money right but but for 2025 I don't
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
think so
 
01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.189 align:start position:0%
think so
so

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
anyway well again there's the spike in
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
prices uh in 22 and 23 in the
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
legislature um you may recall in
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
September of 20122 I can't remember it's
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
a special session or was a veto day um
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
passed legislation to provide this
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
additional funding because of the
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
increase in electric costs so um I guess
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
my so my question is are you predicting
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
that 2025
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
2026 things W will have calmed down and
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
will look like those earlier years and
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to change anything that
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's sort of automatically going to work
 
01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
or are we going to worry that this might
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's always hard to say um given that
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the month-to-month variations and
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's a number of factors that are
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
outside the control of the department
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
that might see either uptaking the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
program or um just the the cost of
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
default service um however we have seen
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
a positive trend in the last 6 months
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
now granted something else could happen
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
Global State you know Global events Etc
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
um that could change uh could have an
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
impact on electricity prices to the
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas markets um all else being
 
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
equal I think we're in a good spot we
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
may need need um uh I I can't tell you
 
01:10:31.390 --> 01:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
right here sitting right now that we
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
will never need additional funds the
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
other option is to create a wait list
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
for the program uh which as the
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned that legislation
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
was intended to avoid um having to
 
01:10:44.189 --> 01:10:44.199 align:start position:0%
create a weit list for this
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
program but you have the authority to do
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
so if the program ran out of
 
01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
money uh I believe would that be the
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
does uh control the design of the
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
program and uh how the benefits are
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
distributed the legislature control is
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the amount of money that's
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
collected uh from the through the SBC in
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
the past there have been weight list um
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
when we've had I want to say 2005 when
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
we had really high gas prices then um
 
01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
but but there also H have been instances
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
where the legislature has shifted money
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
from the e portion of the SBC to the
 
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
lowincome um assistance portion uh which
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
was an emergency um legislation one year
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
so there are ways to avoid um doing a
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
weit list uh if possible but also using
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
p uh representative
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
wer I think this might be fracking
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
dependent if somebody shuts down
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
fracking it's going to raise the price
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
of gas way up or they start making
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
trouble about fracking I think it's very
 
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
think uh representative w yes um what
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about is is there was also
 
01:12:31.199 --> 01:12:33.669 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about is is there was also
7,1

01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
7,1
 
01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
dollars given for outside this program
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
rescue the your budget and did
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
that what was that about and is that
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
reoccur so so that was our concern uh
 
01:12:59.550 --> 01:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
about the spike in prices in 2022 um and
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that we could provide
 
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
need representative J just a quick
 
01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
question what were the three programs
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
one's electric one's Heating and what
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
was the third one oh sorry uh the
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program um so
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
that's those are three programs the the
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
latter two are federally funded um 100%
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
federal funds oh okay so state is
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
electric only that's correct okay thank
 
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated okay so the renewable energy
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
fund uh the purpose of this fund is to
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
support a range of renewable energy
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
initiatives including incentive programs
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
for both the residential and
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
nonresidential sectors um and it is
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
funded by altern alternative compliance
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
payments through um the renewable
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard um and I can just
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
give you some background on the RPS um
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
our renewable portfolio standard is a
 
01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
mandate um it's actually really five
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
mandates um that requires electric
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
suppliers uh like our utilities
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregators and
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers to purchase uh a
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of their power from certain
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
classes of renewable energy uh they do
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
so by purchasing renewable energy
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
certificates also known as Rex um from
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
the generators of that renewable energy
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
in order to put guard rails on the costs
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
electric suppliers are enabled to make
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments at a set
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
price if that would be less expensive
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
than buying Rex if they make alternative
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
compliance payments those payments go
 
01:14:56.669 --> 01:14:56.679 align:start position:0%
into into the renewable energy fund
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is administered by uh the
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh the fund is used
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
for programs that provide uh incentives
 
01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
for new renewable energy projects and to
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
fund um renewable energy initiatives as
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
I stated happy to take any
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions all right um let me I'll
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
start so this is a fund that's also
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
growing somewhat out of control right
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
you your
 
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
expenses um are much lower than than the
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
revenue at least for the last two years
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
2023 well you'll see our commitments
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
have increased um and we're about to
 
01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
issue a new budget um for the next
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
program year but there's been a number
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
of of uh of factors uh involved here so
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature has made some reforms to
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
this program in in this last legislative
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
session which the governor signed into
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
law um and I can have Josh discuss some
 
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
of those uh so there's that um the
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
programs had changes made to it which we
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
think are uh are good uh and will have a
 
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
positive impact um also we had covid and
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
the new federal programs and of course
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're tasked with administering many of
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
those as well uh related to energy and
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs um so there's been
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
those factors um but uh you know we we
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
as you can see our commitments um have
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
increased uh and we'll continue to do
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
that and I'll let Josh talk a little bit
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
about where we're
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
headed sure um so as part of uh Senate
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 303 uh which um passed uh both
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
houses was signed by the governor
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
earlier this summer uh made a number of
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
reforms to what uh programs are
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
considered part of the renewable energy
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
fund uh as you can imagine the renewable
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
energy sector is pretty Dynamic um there
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
are programs that may have worked 5 10
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
years ago that are completely irrelevant
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
at this point and no longer um you know
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
no longer useful in the market um so we
 
01:16:55.709 --> 01:16:55.719 align:start position:0%
had a couple of changes made um notably
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh the inclusion of a specific mandate
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
for the agency to set up a uh program um
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
specifically for municipality school
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
districts other sort of um political
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um so there's a specific
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
carve out um for them um anecdotally I
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
can say we have um with some federal
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
funds we set up a municipal solar
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
program um so for municipalities that
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
are looking to install solar arrays on
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
Town owned facilities um with $1.4
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
million available uh we got 30
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
applications um so this is a this is an
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
area where um we've seen certainly
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
strong demand for the towns um couple of
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
other benefits and not only just
 
01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
reducing the energy costs uh
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
specifically electric costs for the
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities um reduced the costs um
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
putting downward pressure on property
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
there all right representative aling
 
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um you've got a whole bunch of
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
things in here I don't think that one is
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
is in the list but
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
what thank you for the question um so as
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner referenced there
 
01:18:15.149 --> 01:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
are five different um mandates within
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard uh a
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of the electricity
 
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
that is sold um needs to have a certain
 
01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of a particular renewable
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
techn techology type so it's not just
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
Renewables in general there are specific
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
different classes within um so Class 2
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
is solar so they uh renewable energy
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
certificates uh generated from the
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
installation installation of solar
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
arrays um so the requirement as you see
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably uh it's uh
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
number uh depending on which um form of
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
the book in front of me has it as number
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
three the most recent report that we
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
filed earlier this summer has it as
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
number two but um where it's the
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of the class two monies need
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
to be allocated um class two refers to
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
solar so it's the the direction is any
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
of the alternative compliance payments
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
that come in for solar at minimum should
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
be spent on solar um and I can say that
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
we we exceed that minimum
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
requirement so that it doesn't give the
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
percentage in this list but it gives
 
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
other percentages
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
so um yes so it it requires um that the
 
01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
the statute if you look all the uh the
 
01:19:26.189 --> 01:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
the full-blown version of our RSA 362 F
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
colon 10 um mandates that we spend that
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh the any Class 2 monies received or
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
alternative CLI compliance payments
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
received from class 2 specifically need
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
Technologies so it's
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
open-ended yes so there's a floor
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
there's no there's not necessarily a
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
ceiling other than the other constructs
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah this
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
is and then it funds non-residential
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
energy projects but that's kind of
 
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.790 align:start position:0%
energy projects but that's kind of
open-ended

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
open-ended
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
too and yes so we uh we issue a request
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
for a proposal every year for uh
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant process for those um
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
so we've seen everything from uh
 
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
District heating systems using biomass
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
um to the renovation and retrofit of um
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
of small scale hydroelectric dams in the
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
between yeah it's a little difficult to
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
figure out how much is going where from
 
01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.669 align:start position:0%
figure out how much is going where from
this

01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
list and and what where is is
 
01:20:57.669 --> 01:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes we could share with the
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
committee our budgets that we publish
 
01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
for the programs we we could provide you
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
with the previous year and um of course
 
01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
when we issue the next we could provide
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
that to the
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
committee are you suggesting that
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps there should be separate
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds for each of the
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
uses um well obviously there this is
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
based partly on the the Reggie uh
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
mandates M and if the mandate is that
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
you spend so much and you can spend more
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
difficult but yeah if you have a budget
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
that presented for each of those that
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
for where it is right now that would
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
give you an
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
idea so let me ask this practically is
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
there an upper limit on the amount of
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
power power that can come from renewable
 
01:21:59.550 --> 01:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
energy because renewable energy is not
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
very controllable in the sense that you
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
know when it's sunny you'll get a lot of
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
it and when it's not you'll not and so
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
on so does it make the whole system at
 
01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.830 align:start position:0%
on so does it make the whole system at
some

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
point does it make the whole system
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
unreliable if you had too much of it and
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
point well not practical but anyway well
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
well and and and I'll have joshh help me
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
out on this one as well but the um you
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
know we have a regional grid operator
 
01:22:32.910 --> 01:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
ISO New England um and they are tasked
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
with um administering the Wholesale
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
Electric market and um uh operating the
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
transmission system and also uh making
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a reliable system in
 
01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
New England um so uh I I I'm not sure we
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
would be uh or or this program would
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
lead to any uh risk uh for reliability
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
for the region just because there are
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
other uh controls in place um that I
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
think would prevent that and Josh I
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if we missed anything but
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's and there are there are a variety
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
of Market mechanisms the iso New England
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
has in order to incent uh newer
 
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
development um and there's a uh we have
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
folks who specifically their jobs are to
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
follow those Market developments and
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
make sure New Hampshire's interest are
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
represented um during those discussions
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
who can speak far more eloquently than I
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
can about it but there's a series of
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
mechanism sort of in place to ensure
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
that the lights stay on um no matter
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
what the weather is outside and the iso
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
does considerable planning um for
 
01:23:37.629 --> 01:23:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
market all right the reason I'm asking
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
is this this is pushing people in New
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to install solar and other
 
01:23:51.149 --> 01:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
similar things right and so um at some
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
point presumably you could have more so
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
ER than there's Demand right and so you
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you'd want to to dial this back
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
right so but maybe we're not even close
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
to that right maybe we're just a a
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
fraction of the I don't believe this
 
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
program alone could lead to
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
that I uh I would agree with that just
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
based on um there's no mandates in this
 
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
this is if somebody wants to do have
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
these whatever variety of systems
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
installed in their homes um it's
 
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
entirely up to the the individual
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
homeowner or the business if want to
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of these
 
01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.709 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of these
programs

01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's not really relevant but
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
anyway go ahead representative alling
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah there are uh two things one there
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
are places that in in our system because
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
the electric lines for some reason the
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
utilities cannot create uh the um a
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient so that that people on those
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
electric lines would be able to install
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
solar um that's one break on it and and
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
then um there's something that has been
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
coming up lately that that I think
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
started in
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh in Sea Coast
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
with with um
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
UNH on and came to Lebanon this last
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
last year uh which take uses the energy
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
generated from the methane dissolving in
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
landfills which is also a reliable quite
 
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
reliable source um but the Technologies
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
are as you know are uh
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
evolving uh rapidly on the on the
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
renewable energy side and is there any
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
um latitude
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
within the Reggie mandates that allows
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
for that that extension of different
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
methodologies to create uh
 
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
security uh through improved battery use
 
01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.510 align:start position:0%
security uh through improved battery use
and

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:19.189 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
on methane use and such
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
Josh could probably speak to the to the
 
01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
statute better than I but the
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
legislature can make changes to the RPS
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
um and if there are changes that you'd
 
01:26:35.709 --> 01:26:35.719 align:start position:0%
like to make to these various classes um
 
01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
that is something that that you could
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
propose tell me about the commitments
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
column here so it says expenses 2024
 
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
expenses 2.8 million commitments
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
5.4 what does that mean sorry that's a
 
01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:55.030 align:start position:0%
5.4 what does that mean sorry that's a
financial

01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
than that's an incumbrance in our
 
01:26:56.719 --> 01:26:57.950 align:start position:0%
than that's an incumbrance in our
financial

01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
system so did they really in 2024
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
spend uh what would it be
 
01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.189 align:start position:0%
spend uh what would it be
8.2

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
million I think that's for next year
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
that for the record Rdio r auu t IO I'm
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
the chief of operations for Department
 
01:27:22.109 --> 01:27:22.119 align:start position:0%
of energy so commitments are all the
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
grants and contracts that we have inum
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
in the system so those are not spent out
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
yet but they're committed to be spent
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
for those that um were awarded the um
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
competitive competitively bid uh grants
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
and the uh so the really the only
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
expenses that went out of that account
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
is the 2.8 million and the 5 million 5.3
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
million will be spent at some time um
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
just depending on when the the grantees
 
01:27:46.950 --> 01:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
have done what they were supposed to do
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
in order to receive the payment okay but
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
in 2023 you made 3 million in
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
commitments but in 2024 you spent less
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
than 3 million so the commitments aren't
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily created in that fiscal year
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
it could be commitments say um given a
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
grant for five years it could have been
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
a commitment that rolled over from a
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
previous year so we'd have to actually
 
01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
look look at each individual commitment
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
to see what that entails if it's from
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
past years or if it's from the current
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
year but um you're correct so we enter
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
into we enter into grants and then
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
depending on how fast or what what the
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
requirements of the grants is depends on
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
how quickly we pay them out because they
 
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
have to do they have to do certain
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
things before they can receive payment
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
so it could it could lapse over to
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
different years um just like ones that
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
we enter into this year we may not we
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
may pay out a portion of them we may not
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
pay out till the next year and so if we
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
made no payments towards these
 
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:46.400 align:start position:0%
commitments that 5.3 would roll over
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
into FY um fiscal year 25 which a lot so
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
that that's basically what that means is
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year what are your GR
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
and what are the commitments for all the
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
grants and stuff you have and that's the
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
5.3 so if if there was no more revenue
 
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
from now on and there were no more new
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
grants from now on the ending balance in
 
01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
this fund When the Smoke Clears years
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
from now would be $15 million correct
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir okay thank
 
01:29:19.109 --> 01:29:19.119 align:start position:0%
you all right Senator gray if if you
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
look at this differently on these charts
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay the commitments from one year
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay like if it's a commitment listed in
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
23 okay you actually pay it in
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
24 so if you were trying to figure out
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
what your expenses for 24 is you got to
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
subtract the 23 commitments and add the
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
commitments at the end of 24 to know
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what you did and that's why this
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
thing gets so confusing and that's why
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
we've we've done what we've done so that
 
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
you know what the balances are correct
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
there were some agencies in these
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
reports that were doing exactly what
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
Senator Grace said so they were changing
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
their expense number and other agencies
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
were not so we stipulated everybody's
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
got to do it the same way it's not
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
double counted it's just off to the
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
right so you can see and have a sense of
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
what's coming up but it is not specific
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
to a fiscal year so they may have
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
multi-year grants a lot of agencies will
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
spend it the next year and then they'll
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
do a new one and they'll spend that the
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
next year so some of them are shortterm
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
so you have a better sense these guys
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
multi-year it0 to 90 days really depends
 
01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
ons of yeah and I can give you an
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
example you know during covid Supply
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
chains were disrupted so projects that
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
we had awarded funding to um you know
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
either just prior to the pandemic or
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
during 2020 and 2021 um number of those
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
contracts we've had to um amend and
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
extend several times so those projects
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
because they hadn't met Milestones but
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
not this wasn't their fault it was just
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues materials labor
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
things like that um so you know those
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
projects will be paid for in full upon
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
time representative thank you
 
01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.629 align:start position:0%
time representative thank you
uh

01:31:13.629 --> 01:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
the are when you make these commitments
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
have you all they already got the
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
permits or is that part of the problem
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
them and uh do some of those just fall
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
out because they can't get the
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
permits there's um usually permitting is
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
one of the steps um for solar in
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
particular there's usually an
 
01:31:38.109 --> 01:31:38.119 align:start position:0%
interconnection question um for you know
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
existing hydroelectric dams that are
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
being refitted you you know the
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
interconnection point or the place they
 
01:31:44.430 --> 01:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
plug into the grid for a lack of a
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
better way of putting it um is usually
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
already there but there's a variety of
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
other things that um we have as sort of
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
goal uh Milestones that they need to
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
meet in order to get payments out and
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
usually permitting is usually one of the
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
ones that's up front so we know up front
 
01:31:59.950 --> 01:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
okay is this is this project going to
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
happen because you don't want to have
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
them the give them a bunch of money and
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
the permitting falls through and then
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
you're the state's out out of money so
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
we the permitting is loaded up front one
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the first things that they're
 
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
do okay all right any other questions
 
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenell thank you and I'm sorry
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
I miss the beginning of this so if it's
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
already been asked just tell me to shut
 
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
up um I'm looking at this large ending
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
balance I mean the
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
balances have been growing in the
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
not um spending more money out of that
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
fund are we turning people away are we
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
cutting programs off or we just not
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
advertising them correctly so that more
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
of this money gets spent for the purpose
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
we've dedicated it
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
to sure thank you for the question
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
Senator and the last thing I would ever
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
tell you would be to shut
 
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.510 align:start position:0%
tell you would be to shut
up

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
well um at any rate um no that's that's
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
a that's a good question right because
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
that number does jump out on the on the
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
balance sheet and we've sort of been
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
discussing this as as um this
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
conversation has been uh continuing But
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
to answer it sort of directly headon
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
it's a variety of factors um so if you
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
look at the the revenue sides um you can
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
see that the the revenues have sort of
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
ranged for this fund down as low as 2.2
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of years all the way
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
to uh 8.5 last year so there's a variety
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
of circumstances that go into that are
 
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
outside the state control for how the
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
revenues come in the revenues are
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
derived from alternative compliance
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
payments which are payments made by the
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
Community power associations and
 
01:34:03.990 --> 01:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers anyone who sells
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
electricity is required under the state
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
law um to have a certain portion of
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
their electricity generated from certain
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
types of renewable resources if for
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they cannot uh acquire
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
enough renewable energy certificates to
 
01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
cover whatever they've sold uh they make
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
what is called an alternative compliance
 
01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.550 align:start position:0%
what is called an alternative compliance
payment

01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
those payments um are then deposited
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
into the fund the renewable energy
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
certificate Market is a regional market
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
so there could be a policy change that
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
is made in Massachusetts that's made in
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Rhode Island Maine or
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
Vermont that then impacts what happens
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and if the price
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
is for a a comparable renewable energy
 
01:34:48.669 --> 01:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
certificate is higher in Massachusetts
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
or if it's lower in Maine the the market
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
will decide where the best place is the
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
utilities will decide strategically
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
where to put any of the renewable energy
 
01:34:59.790 --> 01:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
certificates that they've purchased in
 
01:35:02.189 --> 01:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
order to minimize their own cost excuse
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
me their own costs which are then passed
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
on to the rate payers so there's a
 
01:35:07.229 --> 01:35:07.239 align:start position:0%
variety and we don't necessarily know
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
until the payments come in what that
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
number is going to be so part of your
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
question about the programs that's sort
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
of part of the the the reason um that we
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
just don't spend every dollar that we
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
get every year because we don't want to
 
01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
be opening and closing programs
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
constantly we don't want to you know
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
throttle up the money and have say $10
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
million out on the street for a variety
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
of programs and then have to immediately
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
ratchet that back down to a million
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
dollars the next year so they having
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
that a bit of stability and being in
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
within the program so the either the um
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
individuals or the um or the
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
organizations or the businesses usually
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
these programs um when they're coming in
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
to apply for money are not just uh
 
01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're usually applications
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
that take and planning that takes a
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
couple of years um to to get to fruition
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
before they're ready to go so have
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
having a constant and steady level of
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
funding um is very important because you
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to have that sort of that
 
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
whipsaw effect going back and
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
forth that being said um with two years
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
of of decent revenues here um we are um
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
we will have a budget memo as mentioned
 
01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
earlier to the committee that'll be
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
coming either out later this week or
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
early next week um where you'll see an
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
increase in the amount of funding uh
 
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
coupled on with that um Senate Bill 303
 
01:36:21.629 --> 01:36:21.639 align:start position:0%
which um passed the legislature this
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
year was signed into law um made a
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
couple of reforms
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
through renewable energy fund programs
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine uh the renewable
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
energy sector is a particularly Dynamic
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
one so a program that would have worked
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
five years ago or 10 years ago is not
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily as relevant as it is today
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so we had some uh there were
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
limitations on where we were sending
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
money and it was sort of we did some
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input um about a couple of
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
programs that were generally not
 
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
functioning the way they should and
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
they're not actually doing what they're
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to be designed to do um we're
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
able to make those reform again with the
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
with the help of your colleagues um to
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
make those reforms I'm including uh
 
01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
adding a specific Municipal uh program
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
out of the renewable energy fund um
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
we've heard from a lot of municipalities
 
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
um actually a perfect example is the
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
municipal solar program that we
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
currently have um funded with federal
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
dollars um we had 1.4 million available
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
we got 30 applications um from
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities looking to install solar
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so we've seen there's sort of this
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
strong demand for um uh local political
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
subdivisions whether it's cities towns
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
school districts Etc uh looking to do
 
01:37:29.790 --> 01:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
sort of these more renewable energy
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
projects but there's not necessarily the
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
funding that goes along with it then
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
there sort of the bonus impact of not
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
only do these communities get to do uh
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
what they'd like to do in reducing their
 
01:37:41.709 --> 01:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
own electricity costs um it also uh
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
reduces upward pressure on property
 
01:37:45.270 --> 01:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
taxes as well so there's sort of a
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
there's a win-win there so I apologize
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
that was a very long-winded answer but
 
01:37:52.270 --> 01:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
so when you say 30 applications that
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything to me how much
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
dollar amount are they asking for versus
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
how much you gave them uh so um I cannot
 
01:38:03.830 --> 01:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
say at this point because we're still in
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
the contract negotiation or the grant
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
negotiation phase with uh with these
 
01:38:09.629 --> 01:38:09.639 align:start position:0%
communities um so unfortunately I can't
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
answer that question due to due to state
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
law but um the uh Municipal program was
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
a specific set aside in Senate Bill
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
303 um so that program has not been
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
developed yet it is just
 
01:38:26.350 --> 01:38:26.360 align:start position:0%
let me ask the question a different way
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
you have 1 something million to spend
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
yes okay 30
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
applications $40,000 a piece on average
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
does $440,000 buy you a half of a solar
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
facility a
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
quarter you know it depends on a variety
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
of factors I mean $40,000 doesn't go
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
particularly far if you're you know if
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
you're a a town hall or something like
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
that that does not go very far in terms
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
of of meting the load um I can say the
 
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
program was over
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
subscribed okay I I'm not I'm not
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
deliberately trying to be uh Senator but
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um as I recall we took this
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
program out of the
 
01:39:08.719 --> 01:39:10.629 align:start position:0%
program out of the
budget

01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
this last year right so we have
 
01:39:16.199 --> 01:39:18.310 align:start position:0%
this last year right so we have
less

01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe less oversight of it but the
 
01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:24.510 align:start position:0%
um maybe less oversight of it but the
the

01:39:24.510 --> 01:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
purposes that it's used to pay for are
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
onetime they look like
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
onetime payment somebody puts solar on
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
their house they can get a rebate
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
somebody WEA you know does some other
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
energy saving like I've talked to you
 
01:39:47.830 --> 01:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
about um heat pump installations those
 
01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:48.870 align:start position:0%
about um heat pump installations those
are

01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
one-time expenses why would it be so bad
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
to spend down clo not to zero but spend
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
down more of the money in the
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
fund given that we're talking about
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
one-time expenses that an individual a
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
business or a community ask for it
 
01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable um I'll answer the second
 
01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
part first and then I'll have our um our
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh administrative folks talk about the
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
the first piece of it about the budget
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
question um so we do have a variety of
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
those rebate programs um we've been able
 
01:40:34.109 --> 01:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
to ensure um that with the passage of
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
303 Senate Bill 303 excuse me that all
 
01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
those programs remain open so it doesn't
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
matter that you're trying to shoot for a
 
01:40:42.189 --> 01:40:42.199 align:start position:0%
narrow window of when the program might
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
be open in order to get your rebate
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
right that may the idea is that may make
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
a decision for somebody on an economic
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
basis do I do this project or not so
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
knowing that that money is there is
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
important in terms of making that
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
decision because if it's a gamble of
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
okay the program might be open might be
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
closed that that there's an economic
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
decision that's made at that point um
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
regarding the competitive programs um we
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
have seen um particular for the low
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
moderate income solar program uh grant
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
program so it's a community solar
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
program um that there are typically are
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofits who are usually the ones um
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
who are coming in who are applying to
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
get funding to basically build these
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
arrays and then use them for the benefit
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
of of low moderate income households um
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
having more money available as you as
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned makes a difference right
 
01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.639 align:start position:0%
if somebody sees there's $400,000
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
available someone does the I can't say
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
risk analysis probably not the right way
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
of putting it but thinking okay what are
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
my chances are of of getting this grant
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
versus if you put more money out on the
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
street we have seen as you incrementally
 
01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
put more money out on the street that
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
you get better response so the last
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
thing I'd want to do is say okay there's
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of money this year and
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
then maybe it's gone or maybe it's it's
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
reduced um and then come in you know two
 
01:41:59.070 --> 01:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
years from now and just say oh sorry no
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
more we don't have any more money we
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
can't do this program so it's sort of
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
this having the cons we've heard from
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that having consistency in
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
the amount of funding even if it doesn't
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily you know it doesn't dramatic
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
swings one way or the other it doesn't
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
help send good Market signals to folks
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
who are coming in applying for these
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
funds all right let's move on to the big
 
01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
funds all right let's move on to the big
fund

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
here I think
 
01:42:27.390 --> 01:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
one so the Energy Efficiency fund was
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
established in 2008 uh when the New
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature authorized the
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
state's participation in the regional uh
 
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative um Reggie is a
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
regional cap and trade program designed
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
to reduce uh carbon emissions among its
 
01:42:48.189 --> 01:42:48.199 align:start position:0%
members um it works by establishing a
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
cap on co2 that generators are allowed
 
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
to emit by purchasing Co to allowances
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
in quarterly auctions um that get baked
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
into the generator's costs uh the
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
revenue from those allowances are sent
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
back to the member states um Reggie has
 
01:43:06.350 --> 01:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
11 member States including every New
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
England State um most of these states
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
have carbon emissions reductions goals
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire does not um the reason
 
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
we participate is due in large part
 
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
because we're part of the isono England
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
grid um if we did not participate in
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
Reggie our ratee payers would still bear
 
01:43:23.790 --> 01:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
um however we would lose on the benefit
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so to help thread the needle of this
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
problem New Hampshire has made the
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
decision uh to rebate and that was the
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
legislature to rebate the vast majority
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
of the funding back to rate payers um to
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
minimize the costs that we have to pass
 
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
questions so all of the expenses of this
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
fund are these rebates or
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
Not dollar I'm sorry the first dollar of
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
every allowance goes to uh the Energy
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
Efficiency funds and administrative
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
costs um everything above a dollar uh of
 
01:44:04.589 --> 01:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
each allowance is rebated to um to rate
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
payers um in the auction that concluded
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
for the third quarter um just this last
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
week um roughly I believe 18 million um
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
payers 8 out of the 57 or something like
 
01:44:25.679 --> 01:44:31.070 align:start position:0%
payers 8 out of the 57 or something like
that

01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
Sor uh yeah I just need the numbers
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
sorry so the auction was
 
01:44:37.719 --> 01:44:39.870 align:start position:0%
sorry so the auction was
18,6

01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
18,6
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
77,000 and rebate amount was 17,9 52,000
 
01:44:46.709 --> 01:44:46.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry rebate was 177 million
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay so so almost all but there almost
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
all yeah 650,000 roughly went to the
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
programs and admin
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
costs all right by programs there are
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
some Energy Efficiency things in here
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes low income programs Etc yes now is
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
that similar to all these programs in
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
the previous fund or
 
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:11.719 align:start position:0%
different similar but but different um
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
and I can have Josh speak to for
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
instance the all fuels Energy Efficiency
 
01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
program sure so um if you're looking um
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's the the series of programs that
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
are um included as part of that $1 uh
 
01:45:27.910 --> 01:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
per allowance set aside that the
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner referenced um less uh
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
administrative costs both at the at the
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
department of energy as well as at Dees
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
um there are a pair of programs there's
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
a certain set aside for low moderate
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
income programs um those are
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
administered by New Hampshire saves so
 
01:45:45.149 --> 01:45:45.159 align:start position:0%
those are rolled in with the other
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs administered
 
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:49.719 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire saves uh there's a
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
further $2 million which is set as a set
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that is made available um
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
again through New Hampshire saves for
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
the uh for municipalities doing Energy
 
01:46:03.629 --> 01:46:03.639 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects as well uh last but
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
not least once the basically any of the
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
the crumbs are left over at the end of
 
01:46:11.310 --> 01:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
those um uh carats deductions however
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
you want to refer to them as uh goes
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
into our uh the Department's uh all
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
so-called all fuels program um this is
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
one that we run on a competitive basis
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
bis um to see basically what you know
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
what what what are the needs out there
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the market um and where this sort of
 
01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:31.639 align:start position:0%
funding can can plug those gaps uh
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
currently the existing program that is
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
out there um that runs through the end
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the year uh is uh with New Hampshire
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
saves um which was competitively bid and
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
awarded to New Hampshire saves um to
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
provide um Energy Efficiency funding to
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
those who basically don't qualify for
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
our um any of the means tested programs
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
but are still on the lower end of the
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
income Spectrum so they may not be be
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
able to meet the full cost match that is
 
01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
required if they were to go through New
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves for example um this
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
helps defray that cost um to make those
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
projects um affordable um for those
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
households uh with the end of that
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
program um coming up at the end of this
 
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
calendar year um we are uh preparing to
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
do stakeholder sessions um to figure out
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
what you know what is the need out there
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
what is the best use of these dollars um
 
01:47:19.750 --> 01:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
to help form a competitive uh RFP um
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
that we hope to um undertake sometime
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
early in the next calendar year all
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
right other questions from the
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
not oh I'm sorry because this is uh the
 
01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative um
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
there are uh emissions testing that they
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
have staff that will go out and do um so
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's that sort of that the compliance
 
01:47:47.550 --> 01:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
piece of it uh on the opposite end that
 
01:47:50.189 --> 01:47:50.199 align:start position:0%
our colleagues at Dees
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
handle you're welcome sorry I just sort
 
01:47:59.550 --> 01:47:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
that right I'm not seeing any other
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
hands here all right the last
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
one so for the site evaluation committee
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask uh Andrew Beamer the
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
SEC administrator uh to come up and
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
mostly greetings I am Andrew Beamer b i
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
SEC go
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
ahead basically my agency which has now
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
been uh rolled into the Pu per
 
01:48:57.910 --> 01:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
legislation last year uh we generate
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue by the um uh filing fees for new
 
01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
facilities upgrades and transfers of
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
ownership historically that's ebed and
 
01:49:08.669 --> 01:49:08.679 align:start position:0%
flowed significantly you have things
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
like the Northern Pass project that
 
01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
obviously despite not being built filed
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
seven figures worth of filing
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
fees uh then you have years such as I
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
believe last year 2023 we had zero
 
01:49:24.629 --> 01:49:24.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue in terms of filing fees that is
 
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
because nobody tried to build anything
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%
nobody tried to upgrade anything and uh
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
fortunately nobody filed any complaints
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
against any utility companies that
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
required investigation that is another
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
that was another source of um of revenue
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
agency um so basically what we're
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
looking at here is the salary um the
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
expenses of my agency are basically my
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
salary plus um other office expenses and
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
then Money Paid to other agents
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so now that you're part
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the P can can your all of this
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
activity be part of their budget and and
 
01:50:11.709 --> 01:50:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
fund that would be a question of whether
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
or not the regular utility assessment
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
can support these type of payments I
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if uh commissioner has has
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
any uh comments on that or if that's a
 
01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:27.510 align:start position:0%
any uh comments on that or if that's a
legislative

01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
decision I would imagine you be a
 
01:50:32.189 --> 01:50:32.199 align:start position:0%
legislative decision so right now these
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
the actions of this committee are not
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
funded by the general utility assessment
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
that's why there was a dedicated fund
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
set up for it um that would have to be a
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislative decision on whether or not
 
01:50:43.629 --> 01:50:43.639 align:start position:0%
those could be
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
used but effectively there's hardly any
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
Revenue here so it's really the general
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
fund paying for this right that is
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
correct and so yeah go ahead
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative Al me yes but if someone
 
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
puts in another major pro project there
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be both revenue and the need
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
revenue that's accurate the the the good
 
01:51:10.069 --> 01:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
thing about the funding mechanism if you
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
will is that when there's a lot of work
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
to be done we're also collecting a lot
 
01:51:15.310 --> 01:51:15.320 align:start position:0%
of filing fees in general the filing fee
 
01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
for a new generation facility I believe
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
is uh around $60,000 as a base fee and
 
01:51:23.069 --> 01:51:23.079 align:start position:0%
then there's um additional
 
01:51:26.589 --> 01:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
money per megawatt or per uh per mile of
 
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
transmission if the case may be and we
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
um there are incentives um for instance
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
where the fees are slightly less if
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
you're trying to build renewable energy
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
versus if you were trying to build a
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
coal facility um but in the instance of
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
that yes we would have the ability to
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
fund that through two mechanisms really
 
01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
the first one is the filing fees that
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
come to us when they file the
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
application for the permit the second
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
one is the committee itself has the
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
ability to charge the applicant extra
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
money for the hiring of external
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
Consultants so that money is paid um I
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
don't actually physically touch the
 
01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
money what happens in that instances the
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
SEC will say to the developer whoever
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
that is we're going to need to hire an
 
01:52:17.589 --> 01:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
outside attorney to help us with this
 
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
case the we take bids we determine the
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh the contractor for that task and then
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
that person sends their bills to me I
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
approve them and then I send them
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
directly to the uh to the applicant so
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
in the case of the northern past just
 
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
since it's a big example we can all
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
remember there was a gentleman working
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
as a council for the committee and that
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
gentleman was being paid directly by
 
01:52:49.149 --> 01:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
ever source with the approval of um the
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
wer so what did the SEC do on the year
 
01:53:04.030 --> 01:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
that there was no activity well the the
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the filing fees are collected in the
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
year of the filing so uh last year for
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
instance I had multiple open dockets one
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
of them was a long investigation into
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
the Anum Wind Facility that a lot of you
 
01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:17.679 align:start position:0%
are probably at least you know
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
peripherally familiar with there was an
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
upgrade to a facility at um at C Brook
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
and there were series of Investigations
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
and other permitting issues that had
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
preceded the the fiscal year so the
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
dockets were um we were still working on
 
01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
2022 matters in the year 2023 we just
 
01:53:45.310 --> 01:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:49.669 --> 01:53:49.679 align:start position:0%
you me just to get that clear you're
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the actual
 
01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.669 align:start position:0%
talking about the actual
year

01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
2023 not not F FY
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
23 I'm actually I was probably talking
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
about FY 2023 right because that's
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
what's reflected here yes he the okay
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I was when I said 2023 to be clear
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
apologies I meant fiscal year 2023 okay
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 24 which is also
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
finished you were still working on a
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
number of these
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
that's accurate and we had one filing
 
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
just for the record was a um it was a
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
transfer of
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
ownership which is a pretty basic fee in
 
01:54:35.910 --> 01:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
the old construction of the SEC which we
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
were still under at that time you had
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
the option to request review by a
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which would have been 3600
 
01:54:44.109 --> 01:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
and the full committee I believe was
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
something like um uh $12,000 $112,000
 
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that range so they request
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
Ed and were granted the ability to have
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
that heard by a subcommittee hence the
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
24 represent could I just ask you on one
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the problems that you had and
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
probably still have is that it is the
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
directors of different agencies that
 
01:55:20.990 --> 01:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
represent that staff these committees
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
rather than you and a bunch of them
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
don't seem didn't seem to be terribly
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
interested in showing
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
up one of the issues was at the
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee level the subcommittee
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
level would see a high level of rotation
 
01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
because a lot of them would appoint um
 
01:55:43.149 --> 01:55:43.159 align:start position:0%
designes and the issue there was that
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
when the subcommittees were doing the
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
bulk of the investigating or the bulk of
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
the adjudicating as in the case of
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
antrum which took two years you had
 
01:55:51.679 --> 01:55:53.870 align:start position:0%
antrum which took two years you had
multiple

01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
generations of designes literally
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
retiring from state government uh so
 
01:56:01.270 --> 01:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
there was there was turnover there um
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the actual heads of the
 
01:56:06.189 --> 01:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
agencies that were on the SEC that was
 
01:56:11.069 --> 01:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation Dees cultural resources
 
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
Bea the three pu Commissioners and then
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
two public members they were all to a
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
person phenomenal and there were certain
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
times when we would have to have a
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
hearing on a specific day or within a
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
specific time frame where we couldn't
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
get all of them but by and large the um
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
the ex officio members who were
 
01:56:31.709 --> 01:56:31.719 align:start position:0%
department heads were excellent or their
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
designes were excellent because they
 
01:56:35.310 --> 01:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
would put in somebody who they knew was
 
01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:37.239 align:start position:0%
better equipped for the task at hand for
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
instance they gave me a sound engineer
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
for a docket that had to do with sound
 
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
now in the new construction of the SEC
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
we have five people to establish a
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
three-person quorum that's the Pu plus
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
one public member and plus the
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of environmental services
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
so the Quorum however cannot only be the
 
01:57:00.709 --> 01:57:00.719 align:start position:0%
Pu that was written into the law so it
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be two PE theoretically it
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be hard to get everybody but
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
if we were only going to be able to get
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
three people it couldn't just be the 3
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
puuc it would have to be two of them
 
01:57:17.229 --> 01:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
Dees long way of saying I think the um
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
the changes that we've made in the past
 
01:57:24.069 --> 01:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
year are going to go a long way towards
 
01:57:30.990 --> 01:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.950 --> 01:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
future thanks all right so maybe I'll
 
01:57:37.069 --> 01:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
talk to the person who sponsored the
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
bill to move you to to pu and see if
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
they intended to move your funding to
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
their funding as well right
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
so out of the general
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
fund we I'll talk about that okay if I
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
if I may yes go ahead um regardless of
 
01:57:58.589 --> 01:57:58.599 align:start position:0%
the you know yes the using general funds
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
is not is not ideal but if there ever
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
was a uh a docket like like northern
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
pass for instance we would need a
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism to collect those the the
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
funding for those you'd still have that
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
right the you'd still have the fee for
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
the do for the application but it's
 
01:58:18.069 --> 01:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
right so um so the changes to the SEC
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
the the funding mechanism in down years
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
where there are no applications was not
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
addressed that is correct yeah I mean
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
but it it would just not be this
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund it could go into their
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
accounts right the
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
pu's accounts yeah well the only account
 
01:58:37.629 --> 01:58:37.639 align:start position:0%
that pu has is the general utility
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
assessment we wouldn't want those the
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
fees being used to fund General utility
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
type so the real question is keeping you
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
you want to keep this fund but possibly
 
01:58:51.149 --> 01:58:51.159 align:start position:0%
the source of funds not general fund but
 
01:58:52.589 --> 01:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
this other fund is that what we're
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
talking about yes sir okay good I can
 
01:58:56.669 --> 01:58:56.679 align:start position:0%
also I can also tell you I believe it
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
has not come up operationally thus far
 
01:59:01.229 --> 01:59:01.239 align:start position:0%
because we're still new into the new the
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
new um Incarnation but I believe that
 
01:59:07.950 --> 01:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
when I am working on SEC specific
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
projects my funding is coming
 
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
specifically out of this right here that
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and when there is no
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
SEC work or minimal SEC work and the Pu
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
decides to pull me in as a fungible
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
resource to help on something that that
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
is coming out of their funding mechanism
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
so so they are separate you I think your
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
your question about asking the bill
 
01:59:34.069 --> 01:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor for the original intent would be
 
01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
a good idea because um
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
um right I mean this says over the years
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
642 th000 of general fund was spent on
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
this right
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
so okay um so I'll just say before we go
 
01:59:55.870 --> 01:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
for lunch um this summer I drove 20
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
hours north of Montreal and toured the
 
01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:00.589 align:start position:0%
hours north of Montreal and toured the
LR

02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
LR
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
2 uh Power Plant which is what would
 
02:00:05.709 --> 02:00:05.719 align:start position:0%
have sub one of the plants that would
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
have sub been for Northern Pass and it
 
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
was absolutely fascinating and I think
 
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's a real shame that that didn't go
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
through um but it but it was a very
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
worthwhile trip if anybody is interested
 
02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
in that kind that thing so all right so
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
we'll come back at 1:00 are we happy
 
02:00:37.109 --> 02:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.270 --> 02:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
you yes it was a lot of fun I'm hoping
 
02:00:45.149 --> 02:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
them um I'd just like all of you to know
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:00:57.149 --> 02:00:57.159 align:start position:0%
color uh part that I put in for resource
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
and natural res cultural resources so
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
that you could could figure out what
 
02:01:07.229 --> 02:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
goes with who on isn't on those sheets
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I should have made copies
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
for everybody or did hash mark or yeah
 
02:01:15.629 --> 02:01:15.639 align:start position:0%
well what I I did do in each case in the
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
first one
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
on it says over here yell
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
612 numbers are a cluster including 9 46
 
02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
33 77 and administrative unit
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
5200 which is not even
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
is this
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
one so this we have individual handouts
 
02:01:47.709 --> 02:01:47.719 align:start position:0%
from all of the agencies this is the one
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
from Department of energy so you have
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that came first we had that from
 
02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.589 align:start position:0%
yeah that came first we had that from
last

02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:02:20.830 --> 02:02:20.840 align:start position:0%

02:58:49.630 --> 02:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
do you mean by CL
 
02:58:53.910 --> 02:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
um yellow which you can't see um they're
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
they're similar is that they are well
 
02:59:01.229 --> 02:59:01.239 align:start position:0%
those are less
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
interacting necessarily but they're
 
02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
forestry oh I see then the orange ones
 
02:59:11.229 --> 02:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
are Canon mountain and those are
 
02:59:14.070 --> 02:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
definitely oh I
 
02:59:26.750 --> 02:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:30.070 --> 02:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay so let's get started it's one
 
02:59:33.630 --> 02:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock wonderful um are you

Department of Natural and cultural

administration okay thank you for coming
Marino

02:59:53.830 --> 02:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:59.760 --> 03:00:02.229 align:start position:0%
 
signed

03:00:02.229 --> 03:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
signed
 
03:00:04.830 --> 03:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right so should we start with
 
03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:07.429 align:start position:0%
okay all right so should we start with
number

03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.229 --> 03:00:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh yes and just just to clarify we do
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
have the uh division heads here as well
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
if there are any specific questions
 
03:00:29.349 --> 03:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the funds that you wish to
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
have clarified by them okay so so this
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
one looks almost defunct right it's got
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
$146,000 and two years ago you spent
 
03:00:44.429 --> 03:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
some money or something like that 140 I
 
03:00:44.439 --> 03:00:46.590 align:start position:0%
some money or something like that 140 I
see

03:00:46.590 --> 03:00:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.910 --> 03:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
$142,000 yeah the current balance that's
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
correct the activity has been uh minimal
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
in this in this account U as of late
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
um but it is a continue it does continue
 
03:01:01.030 --> 03:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be used you'll notice uh between the
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
years 20 and
 
03:01:06.070 --> 03:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
2022 there were some substantial amounts
 
03:01:09.550 --> 03:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
that were encumbered
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
um but it it looks like this is done on
 
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
a periodic basis so as the fund builds
 
03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
the the funds are used and then there
 
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
may be periods start with a description
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then sure yeah do you do you want
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
directors to do it or do you want I'm
 
03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
sure actually yeah that would be that
 
03:01:29.469 --> 03:01:29.479 align:start position:0%
would be fine if if you ask the chair he
 
03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
may let you sit I think that would be
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
helpful multiple people yeah I mean if
 
03:01:36.150 --> 03:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
the others want to sit over there I
 
03:01:38.830 --> 03:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
think that would be helpful just because
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that if the directors could grab a
 
03:01:42.070 --> 03:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
microphone that way they can jump in
 
03:01:43.790 --> 03:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
because they're more intimately aware of
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
the impacts of these funds thank you
 
03:02:02.110 --> 03:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
side turn that
 
03:02:19.150 --> 03:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
right all right director Hackley do you
 
03:02:21.950 --> 03:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
want to just briefly
 
03:02:24.269 --> 03:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
explain the account that uh we're
 
03:02:27.590 --> 03:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
opening with thank you just for the new
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
people we can't have too many mics on at
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:02:31.359 --> 03:02:39.030 align:start position:0%
the same
time

03:02:39.030 --> 03:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
on okay all set all right my name is
 
03:02:43.590 --> 03:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
Patrick Hackley I'm the director for the
 
03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands so this
 
03:02:48.389 --> 03:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
Forest Improvement fund falls under our
 
03:02:51.710 --> 03:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
um division oversight um while it
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like there's been a lot of
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
activity in this fund it is an important
 
03:03:00.590 --> 03:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
fund for us to maintain to have
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
Reserve funding for Acquisitions and
 
03:03:07.150 --> 03:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
dispositions um we're always looking
 
03:03:08.990 --> 03:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
strategically at our landbase to see
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
what we want to see if we can acquire a
 
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
property that's adjacent to an existing
 
03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:13.550 align:start position:0%
property that's adjacent to an existing
State

03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
State
 
03:03:16.030 --> 03:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
Reservation or in the case of perhaps
 
03:03:18.269 --> 03:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
you're aware of Allen State Forest it
 
03:03:20.190 --> 03:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
was a 30 acre parcel that recently was
 
03:03:22.590 --> 03:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and Council the
 
03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
proceeds from that sale which is very
 
03:03:26.349 --> 03:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
close to being
 
03:03:28.510 --> 03:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
transacted will go into the forest
 
03:03:29.790 --> 03:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
Improvement fund that's where these
 
03:03:32.110 --> 03:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
funds will live and we're actually
 
03:03:35.630 --> 03:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
working with um a conservation group and
 
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
the town of Effingham to acquire an 88
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
acre parcel that's adjacent to our Heath
 
03:03:44.550 --> 03:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
Pond bog Forest uh so having this fund
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
gives us that flexibility to park funds
 
03:03:51.150 --> 03:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
and then to use them for um Acquisitions
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
as well as dispositions because
 
03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes an appraisal is needed which
 
03:03:55.910 --> 03:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
can usually be
 
03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 per report um surveys are
 
03:04:00.910 --> 03:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes needed although we do have a
 
03:04:04.950 --> 03:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
survey staff a survey um crew on staff
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's well like uh uh
 
03:04:10.990 --> 03:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
director Marino said it doesn't have
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to have a lot of activity
 
03:04:14.349 --> 03:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
we are planning to have a lot more
 
03:04:16.950 --> 03:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
activity on it and case in point was the
 
03:04:19.389 --> 03:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
Allen State Forest sale I just mentioned
 
03:04:22.349 --> 03:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
so what do what do you mean by State
 
03:04:24.510 --> 03:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
Reservation uh basically lands that the
 
03:04:26.670 --> 03:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
state owns we our our division is
 
03:04:29.110 --> 03:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
charged with managing all the state
 
03:04:31.790 --> 03:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
reservations under the jurisdiction of
 
03:04:35.429 --> 03:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
dncr um so that includes Parks as well
 
03:04:39.110 --> 03:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
about 270 280,000 Acres across the
 
03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
state so what is it other than Parks is
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
it the the land under this building or
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.110 --> 03:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
um fish and game yeah fishing game has
 
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
over 60,000 Acres we actually uh have a
 
03:04:57.469 --> 03:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
partnership with fishing game to manage
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
their Wildlife Management areas so we
 
03:05:02.510 --> 03:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just referring to when I say State
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
reservations those are the um properties
 
03:05:08.429 --> 03:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
that are under our management under this
 
03:05:08.439 --> 03:05:10.590 align:start position:0%
that are under our management under this
Department's

03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
Department's
 
03:05:12.910 --> 03:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
management right so my question was what
 
03:05:14.910 --> 03:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
what is it that's not a
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
park oh State Forest yeah so if there's
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
no developed recreational facilities on
 
03:05:23.429 --> 03:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
the property then it we typically
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
categorize that as a state forest which
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
means it's strictly undeveloped forested
 
03:05:30.630 --> 03:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
land and that's what you sold recently
 
03:05:33.110 --> 03:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
as some of that correct I see gotcha and
 
03:05:34.910 --> 03:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
how much do you expect that sale to go
 
03:05:38.550 --> 03:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
for I think uh this price tag is about
 
03:05:42.349 --> 03:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
132,000 okay so you're looking to buy
 
03:05:44.349 --> 03:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
something right we're working with a
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
conservation fund that's providing
 
03:05:50.229 --> 03:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
really staff resources in kind to help
 
03:05:52.750 --> 03:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
us transact a deal with um uh private
 
03:05:55.229 --> 03:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
land owners in Effingham and uh we're
 
03:05:58.190 --> 03:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
using those funds as match to a federal
 
03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh program that's available to us other
 
03:06:05.229 --> 03:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh Senator roswan thank
 
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
you um am I correct that we've been
 
03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
spending some arpa funds to
 
03:06:18.750 --> 03:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
acquire land and so we don't have we
 
03:06:20.229 --> 03:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
haven't had to
 
03:06:23.590 --> 03:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
spend these dedicated
 
03:06:27.150 --> 03:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
funds um not that I don't think as far
 
03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
dncr May maybe yeah but not we haven't
 
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
used any arpa funds for land
 
03:06:46.590 --> 03:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
acquisition do invol me thank you so any
 
03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
Forest that has recreational trails in
 
03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
it is considered a park no which will
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
get confused with no ma'am I typ
 
03:06:58.510 --> 03:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
typically so we have two different
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
basically two different types of zoning
 
03:07:02.469 --> 03:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
in our state reservations Recreation and
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
Forestry if it's Recreation it would be
 
03:07:06.910 --> 03:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
something akin to like Bear Brook State
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
Park where we have actually developed
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
campgrounds and cabins infrastructure
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
Trails we don't technically consider
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it's we do have Trails
 
03:07:18.630 --> 03:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
through some of our state forests
 
03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
forestry so this would be places where
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's significant
 
03:07:32.190 --> 03:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
recreational uh building in
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
particular where would call it a park
 
03:07:37.469 --> 03:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
yeah or or recreational zoning
 
03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
recreational zoning but it's not a
 
03:07:42.030 --> 03:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
recreational Forest even though it's
 
03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
mostly trees technically all of our
 
03:07:45.950 --> 03:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
forests are recreational but we have we
 
03:07:48.150 --> 03:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
have formal zoning based on
 
03:07:50.349 --> 03:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
the the amount of development in that on
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
that reservation yeah the trails Bureau
 
03:07:55.229 --> 03:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
is under the state parks there Trails as
 
03:07:58.630 --> 03:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know on private land Municipal um
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit forest and lands Parks um so a
 
03:08:05.950 --> 03:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
lot of our state forest also have trails
 
03:08:08.349 --> 03:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
that are connected um through other ways
 
03:08:08.359 --> 03:08:09.950 align:start position:0%
that are connected um through other ways
as

03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
well but they're they're they're under
 
03:08:16.590 --> 03:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
you because you're the ones that
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
purchased them it's some
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
point the property under that we manag
 
03:08:21.760 --> 03:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
point the property under that we manag
through

03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:08:26.110 --> 03:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
dncr was at some point purchased or
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
Recreation when you sell um Timber does
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
it go into this fund no sir we're going
 
03:08:40.190 --> 03:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
to be talking about that Fund in a
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:44.190 align:start position:0%
little bit
okay

03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
question okay there was I'm sorry um you
 
03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
had something in there about also the
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of renting
 
03:08:56.110 --> 03:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
out some of these there was something
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
about rentals yeah that's in the
 
03:09:00.990 --> 03:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
language of the statute but um in my
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
short tenure here as the Director I
 
03:09:06.870 --> 03:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't see that as a uh a notable source
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
of income I don't even know what it
 
03:09:10.990 --> 03:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
would be to rent out equipment forestry
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
equipment of some kind but it's mostly
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
forestry land forest land yeah
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so we can take that out it don't
 
03:09:23.429 --> 03:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
only appeared in one place I
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
think and what are the other sources do
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know from fy20 and 21 when you got
 
03:09:35.110 --> 03:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
the only money you've had in five
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
years only significant money 100,000
 
03:09:39.600 --> 03:09:41.309 align:start position:0%
years only significant money 100,000
each

03:09:41.309 --> 03:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um so that was actually just prior
 
03:09:48.750 --> 03:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
to my arrival um it was in the in the
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
account that was relative to a property
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
that The Nature Conservancy had Acquired
 
03:09:58.349 --> 03:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
and intended to convey it to the state
 
03:10:00.910 --> 03:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
we were going to reimburse The Nature
 
03:10:03.469 --> 03:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
Conservancy uh and and and own that
 
03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
property acquire
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
it however I believe this is related to
 
03:10:11.550 --> 03:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
Forest Legacy which is a federal program
 
03:10:15.030 --> 03:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
that provides funding for purchasing
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
conservation lands um
 
03:10:19.950 --> 03:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
course Legacy allows the landowner to
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
dictate whether they'll allow ATVs or
 
03:10:24.150 --> 03:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
snow bills
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
Etc and does any if anyone remembers
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
this I'm looking over at you
 
03:10:31.389 --> 03:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner if uh if we remember but I
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
believe the government council did not
 
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
um approve of us acquiring it because we
 
03:10:41.070 --> 03:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
could not control the recreational
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
activities they wanted to make sure
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
there was going to be available for
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
ATV uh use so that money stayed in our
 
03:10:50.110 --> 03:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
account we did not disperse it or
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
parcel thank you all right now we got
 
03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:00.349 align:start position:0%
parcel thank you all right now we got
Timber

03:11:00.349 --> 03:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
sales so 356 Timber sales another state
 
03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
lands this is where the revenue from
 
03:11:09.510 --> 03:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
Timber sales related to our partners at
 
03:11:11.389 --> 03:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
fishing gain gets dep
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
positive and the revenue that's
 
03:11:17.870 --> 03:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
generated from these sales supports we
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
have two Foresters on staff and their
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
salary benefits are basically entirely
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
covered by the revenue generated by
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
Timber sales from managing the Wildlife
 
03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
Management areas so it's a it's a
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
symbiotic relationship we conduct their
 
03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
management according to wildlife habitat
 
03:11:38.269 --> 03:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
principles they cover the cost of our
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:48.910 --> 03:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
plans we also do uh forry work for other
 
03:11:51.469 --> 03:11:51.479 align:start position:0%
agencies but it's on a rare occasion um
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
I think there's been some proposals with
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation
 
03:11:56.469 --> 03:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
actually owns quite a bit of land and
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
some of it's has manageable Forest on it
 
03:12:01.469 --> 03:12:01.479 align:start position:0%
but we haven't uh done one of those
 
03:12:03.550 --> 03:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
projects in several
 
03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
years now why are you showing negative
 
03:12:10.110 --> 03:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
2023 is that an
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
expense right 2023 I I think is just
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
when the the B we we had a revenue but I
 
03:12:22.349 --> 03:12:22.359 align:start position:0%
don't think we typically run a deficit
 
03:12:23.910 --> 03:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah if I if I may speak to that that
 
03:12:25.830 --> 03:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
was actually an accounting practice that
 
03:12:28.190 --> 03:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
was that was occurring at the time so
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
what happened was the expenses were
 
03:12:32.830 --> 03:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
being combined with the revenue and
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately in this case what that means
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
is there was there was more Revenue than
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
there was expense we changed that
 
03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
practice we we we we want to change that
 
03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
practice so that the expenses show up on
 
03:12:46.030 --> 03:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
their own line and the revenue shows up
 
03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
in a separate line so
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
this is an accounting practice that's
 
03:12:52.229 --> 03:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
going on that combines the two so it it
 
03:12:54.910 --> 03:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
does make it seem a little bit unclear
 
03:12:57.150 --> 03:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
um I think we've done that I don't think
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
we've incurred any expenses in the last
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years um but that that was
 
03:13:03.550 --> 03:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately that was the the result of an
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
accounting practice that was that made
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
it very unclear we just heard there are
 
03:13:09.150 --> 03:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
two employees getting their salaries
 
03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
from this right so
 
03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.710 --> 03:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
expenses yes so the the the employees
 
03:13:21.469 --> 03:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
are paid through the source of funds out
 
03:13:22.429 --> 03:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
account and the expenses occur in the
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
account but the expenses in this case
 
03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
for these years again are showing up
 
03:13:33.510 --> 03:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
combined against the revenue so we we
 
03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
need to clarify that
 
03:13:40.710 --> 03:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah could you redo this this page yes
 
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes I can I can clarify that right thank
 
03:13:48.990 --> 03:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:52.590 --> 03:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I represent have a question
 
03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
here which is do we want to continue
 
03:13:58.830 --> 03:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
with forestry which would take us into
 
03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:01.070 align:start position:0%
with forestry which would take us into
um

03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
46377 and an administrative unit at the
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
very end of the pages yeah and then we
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
could release this
 
03:14:11.900 --> 03:14:11.910 align:start position:0%
fell do some
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:13.630 align:start position:0%
fell do some
[Laughter]

03:14:13.630 --> 03:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:14:16.830 --> 03:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
work that's a good idea all right so I'm
 
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
the only one that has the colored
 
03:14:21.349 --> 03:14:21.359 align:start position:0%
version of this unfortunately but I did
 
03:14:24.670 --> 03:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
put at the beginning of each colored
 
03:14:28.110 --> 03:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
section that these are a yellow cluster
 
03:14:32.590 --> 03:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
in this case um and refer to
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
6129 46
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
377 and a Au 5200 which is off book
 
03:14:45.070 --> 03:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
somehow so where are we going now 36 um
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to 46 46
 
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay which is on the next
 
03:14:55.229 --> 03:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
page or not the next page of this thing
 
03:14:57.150 --> 03:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
so right
 
03:15:00.750 --> 03:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
right whatever you do in this department
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
requires going back and forth on the
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
pages all right it's page page seven of
 
03:15:10.590 --> 03:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
of their uh report
 
03:15:14.110 --> 03:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
okay very good all right let's
 
03:15:17.070 --> 03:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
continue sure so I'll just jump in and
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
let you know that 355 it's our
 
03:15:21.189 --> 03:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
accounting unit um management and
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
protection fund this is probably one of
 
03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
our most important funds um as you can
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
see it generates a fair amount of
 
03:15:32.030 --> 03:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue and uh we basically use this to
 
03:15:33.550 --> 03:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh compensate our entire Forest
 
03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
management Bureau
 
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
staff um with the exception of the
 
03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
administrator who's generally funded but
 
03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
all the other
 
03:15:44.030 --> 03:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
staff I off the top of my head I think
 
03:15:47.590 --> 03:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have um at least 12
 
03:15:50.590 --> 03:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
12 Foresters on staff um might be off by
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
one or two um we've had a r one
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
retirement we just hired a new Forester
 
03:15:58.590 --> 03:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
but the the and this this also
 
03:16:02.830 --> 03:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
funds um equipment um it it also funds
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh not entirely but a portion of the
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau
 
03:16:09.469 --> 03:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
staff it really funds all of our bureaus
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
we have seven bureaus in our division
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and and this 355 is our kind of our our
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
pivot account we pull funds from this
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
account obviously legitimately according
 
03:16:24.189 --> 03:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
to the statute to fund much of our staff
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
as you may know from from doing the the
 
03:16:28.670 --> 03:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
pre-work on this hearing our division is
 
03:16:31.429 --> 03:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
only about 30% funded with General
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
funds the rest of it comes from other
 
03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
income which of which this is a major
 
03:16:39.389 --> 03:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
source then we have federal
 
03:16:41.790 --> 03:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
funds um that's basically the three
 
03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
buckets of money are federal funds other
 
03:16:47.550 --> 03:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
income and general funds so um and cons
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
plate which is you know technically
 
03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money but it's in a different
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
category so um that's the nature of this
 
03:16:58.630 --> 03:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
um when we do a Timber Harvest on State
 
03:17:01.469 --> 03:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
Reservation land again whether it's Park
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
or Forest land the proceeds from those
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
sales go into the fund and then on an
 
03:17:11.550 --> 03:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
annual basis are then uh used to
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
compensate our staff and to
 
03:17:16.590 --> 03:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
supply um funding for the other bureaus
 
03:17:16.600 --> 03:17:18.070 align:start position:0%
supply um funding for the other bureaus
as

03:17:18.070 --> 03:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:17:20.429 --> 03:17:20.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned but why aren't Timber sales
 
03:17:22.349 --> 03:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
from the in the previous
 
03:17:24.670 --> 03:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
F the timber sales from the previous
 
03:17:27.389 --> 03:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
account we just talked about 356 yeah we
 
03:17:29.910 --> 03:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
keep that separate uh just to keep track
 
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
of um those those because those are from
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game Parks correct and other
 
03:17:36.910 --> 03:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
state agencies like fishing like like I
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned I see this is from your own
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
correct I see okay yep yep thank
 
03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
you so essentially it's it's our our
 
03:17:50.510 --> 03:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
it's really our our pivotal account and
 
03:17:54.510 --> 03:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's been uh a very well-maintained and
 
03:17:56.830 --> 03:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
well managed um account we feel like
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
it's the bread and butter we do have
 
03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
some concerns over
 
03:18:03.550 --> 03:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
time um with warming Winters and wetter
 
03:18:06.510 --> 03:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
Summers our Timber sales program uh
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
we've been doing very well for the last
 
03:18:09.710 --> 03:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
few years but this past year was we're
 
03:18:11.710 --> 03:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
well below our 10e average in Timber
 
03:18:14.110 --> 03:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
harvesting so that that is of some
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
concern for us because you know uh Force
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
management is affected by weather and
 
03:18:22.189 --> 03:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
ground conditions so um we have to be
 
03:18:24.990 --> 03:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
mindful of that in in regards to the the
 
03:18:26.830 --> 03:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
source of the major source of funding
 
03:18:30.510 --> 03:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.750 --> 03:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
account right but this has a
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
considerable balance right I mean it's
 
03:18:36.950 --> 03:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
close to two years worth of
 
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
expenses so so you know if if a year is
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
is even 25% up or down it it's not going
 
03:18:48.349 --> 03:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:18:51.030 --> 03:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
you can easily cover it here we we do
 
03:18:52.990 --> 03:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
have a a healthy balance but that's by
 
03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
Design um given given what I just
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned in regards to bad weather
 
03:18:59.550 --> 03:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
Seasons um markets are such that we
 
03:19:01.229 --> 03:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
don't always get a consistent price for
 
03:19:03.710 --> 03:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
our Timber um that fluctuates with the
 
03:19:06.189 --> 03:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
economy um we're seeing softer prices in
 
03:19:09.309 --> 03:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
White Pine logs and in red oak logs so
 
03:19:13.389 --> 03:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
markets weather and then just the budget
 
03:19:15.550 --> 03:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
cycle as we all know we're looking at a
 
03:19:18.429 --> 03:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
much tighter General funding uh
 
03:19:20.830 --> 03:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
imperative by um the state budget office
 
03:19:24.030 --> 03:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
so we feel like we we need to have that
 
03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
balance to be assured we can keep our
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
forestry staff employed to do the
 
03:19:30.349 --> 03:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
mission that we're required to
 
03:19:34.030 --> 03:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
do what was the other funds of 181,000
 
03:19:34.040 --> 03:19:39.030 align:start position:0%
do what was the other funds of 181,000
in

03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.349 --> 03:19:43.359 align:start position:0%
2020 that I can't speak to um I'm sorry
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman could you point specifically
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
he's looking at 20 the 2020 line on the
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
chart Chris um
 
03:19:53.870 --> 03:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
18155 3 that year other sources oh other
 
03:19:55.950 --> 03:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
sources yeah typically what that
 
03:19:58.870 --> 03:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
represents is a balance that has been
 
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
carried forward from a prior
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
year uh of accumulated uh funding that
 
03:20:07.269 --> 03:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
is designated for something that is held
 
03:20:07.279 --> 03:20:09.510 align:start position:0%
is designated for something that is held
in

03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
incumbrance so in other words all of the
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
normal sources Timber sales State
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
Nursery seat sales leases administrative
 
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
finds all of that is accumulated in the
 
03:20:24.670 --> 03:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
revenue column other sources typically
 
03:20:27.070 --> 03:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
is a figure that
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
represents some kind of a of an
 
03:20:30.990 --> 03:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the account that is not
 
03:20:34.030 --> 03:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
specific to those primary sources in
 
03:20:36.070 --> 03:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
this case it's a matter of management of
 
03:20:39.550 --> 03:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
balances for for encumbered activity
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Aly can you
 
03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
remind me when you were
 
03:20:47.189 --> 03:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
created division of
 
03:20:50.429 --> 03:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
theis National okay division of and land
 
03:20:54.990 --> 03:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
or the department um uh
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
2017 when Governor made his first um
 
03:21:02.309 --> 03:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
yeah address there was considerable
 
03:21:05.389 --> 03:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
confusion yeah as that happened and for
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
years after yeah we still are reminding
 
03:21:11.070 --> 03:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
people who we
 
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
are other
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
questions all right um any more forest
 
03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
questions all right um any more forest
related

03:21:18.630 --> 03:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
related
 
03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
ones yes one one not two actually
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
they're both at the end
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
um now I've got to go back and forth
 
03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:30.790 align:start position:0%
um now I've got to go back and forth
between

03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:21:34.990 --> 03:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
sheets on 377 and I
 
03:21:40.269 --> 03:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
think uh Au 5200 is right after it okay
 
03:21:43.710 --> 03:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
so the last two in our on our
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet hopefully the last two in
 
03:21:46.080 --> 03:21:56.150 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet hopefully the last two in
here

03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah 133 and 13 no no no 33 we're going
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
off of their handout oh all right I'm
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get on oh that one 33 no 33 we
 
03:22:10.309 --> 03:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
we'd already
 
03:22:12.910 --> 03:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
done Forest protection Personnel
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
training fund
 
03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
no that's this one
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
hand and if you want the book it's page
 
03:22:28.229 --> 03:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
159 that's can Canon Mountain ski
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:37.189 --> 03:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
33 yeah no that makes more sense because
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's the last ones in
 
03:22:39.600 --> 03:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
it's the last ones in
here

03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.950 --> 03:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
 
questioning

03:22:51.670 --> 03:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
03:22:54.269 --> 03:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
fund yes tell us what what what is this
 
03:22:58.070 --> 03:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
about and where all of our rers we have
 
03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
11 rers on staff all of them are
 
03:23:03.870 --> 03:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
required to be train Wildfire
 
03:23:07.150 --> 03:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
suppression infection activities and we
 
03:23:10.110 --> 03:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
do receive uh support from the US for
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
service but U the training fund allows
 
03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
us to buy equipment important equipment
 
03:23:18.429 --> 03:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
for them Ro those yellow uh shirts that
 
03:23:21.630 --> 03:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
you see them wearing um uh the tools
 
03:23:24.309 --> 03:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
that they need um and and these costs
 
03:23:26.830 --> 03:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
are significant when we mobilize a crew
 
03:23:29.150 --> 03:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
to send out WEA for instance we've sent
 
03:23:31.950 --> 03:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
about four different Crews combination
 
03:23:34.189 --> 03:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Main and Southern New
 
03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
England personel to fight fires out
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
west while they're out there they're
 
03:23:40.510 --> 03:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
getting critical Wildfire trans through
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
that they to be prepared when they come
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
back here to New Hampshire um it's it's
 
03:23:46.590 --> 03:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
proven to be a very good program for for
 
03:23:48.550 --> 03:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
us um all of our expenses when we
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
mobilize crews are reimbursed by the
 
03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:51.910 align:start position:0%
mobilize crews are reimbursed by the
forest

03:23:51.910 --> 03:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
forest
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
service um so this fund helps uh cover
 
03:23:57.870 --> 03:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
the additional cost to to suit up and
 
03:24:02.510 --> 03:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.590 --> 03:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
Personnel so it's kind of a critical
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
part kind of a mission critical source
 
03:24:08.110 --> 03:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
of funding that we need if we're going
 
03:24:11.070 --> 03:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
to have a viable Forest protection
 
03:24:13.990 --> 03:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
staff except that you're $40,000 in the
 
03:24:17.309 --> 03:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
hole right now
 
03:24:21.070 --> 03:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um well this is a snapshot in time
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
so I don't see it as a I we we are
 
03:24:27.870 --> 03:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
typically reimbursed when we have
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
deficits from the for service so I'm not
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.990 --> 03:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
that that really that will probably go
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
away once we get full reimbursement
 
03:24:40.830 --> 03:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
because we're still in a wildfire season
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
actually that's correct it's it's
 
03:24:44.349 --> 03:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
federally funded this just a matter of
 
03:24:45.870 --> 03:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
timing of the reimbursement that draws
 
03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
from the feder program so we are they
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
are awarded
 
03:24:53.469 --> 03:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
authorized significant amount of money
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
um and it is a reimbursement basis we
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
incur the expenses we then submit the
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement and the draws occur uh
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
just so happens at this CA in this case
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of fiscal year 24 we had not
 
03:25:07.910 --> 03:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
received the draw for reimbursement in a
 
03:25:10.150 --> 03:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
timely fashion and so it appears as
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
though the account is maintaining a
 
03:25:14.710 --> 03:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
deficit but that's really just an
 
03:25:18.229 --> 03:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
accounting deficit the uh the funds will
 
03:25:21.349 --> 03:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
will be drawn and reimbursed but but it
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
says here that you're getting money from
 
03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
fines right as part of it yeah so what
 
03:25:30.510 --> 03:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
does that mean by what do you mean by
 
03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement well the program itself is
 
03:25:34.070 --> 03:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
considered reimbursement meaning we
 
03:25:37.189 --> 03:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
incur the costs and then seek
 
03:25:40.189 --> 03:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement from the source of funding
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
that that's mentioned further down
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
rather than in master Cooperative yeah
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
well what's this fines part
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
oh fines is if someone comes cut when
 
03:25:57.469 --> 03:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
or try not to speak forry lingo here but
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
basically when there's an infraction of
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
a forry law in the state we have a fine
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
structure based on our rules and when we
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
issue fines that Revenue comes into um
 
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
is allowed to be a funding source for
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
this particular training fund
 
03:26:18.189 --> 03:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
typically though Chris I think it comes
 
03:26:21.309 --> 03:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
in 355 and then it can be transferred
 
03:26:23.309 --> 03:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
over to the training pond so that might
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
be part of that that Matrix that we're
 
03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:26.870 align:start position:0%
be part of that that Matrix that we're
talking

03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
talking
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
about so that's a minor I'm sorry that's
 
03:26:33.309 --> 03:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
a minor part of this it is essentially
 
03:26:37.150 --> 03:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's a small amount yes but it's
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
allowed go more
 
03:26:43.389 --> 03:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
than maybe five to 10,000 in a given
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
year total
 
03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
small fraction of the total cost of
 
03:26:50.830 --> 03:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
having a training
 
03:26:55.710 --> 03:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
program okay question yes representative
 
03:26:58.429 --> 03:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
W do you assess fines for Timber
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.870 --> 03:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
lands sort of fine would they be what
 
03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
sort of penalty so we have basal area uh
 
03:27:15.150 --> 03:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
laws basil area is basically
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
Jan yes as I look at this um you know 20
 
03:28:07.870 --> 03:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
2021 through
 
03:28:11.469 --> 03:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
2024 beginning balance column uh in
 
03:28:13.950 --> 03:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
general there's a a degradation of that
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
beginning balance is that also so
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
because of an
 
03:28:22.510 --> 03:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
accounting calculation that that hasn't
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
given us the correct beginning balance
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
or or why or why is that dropping yeah
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
so so many times that balance it's it's
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
really driven by the relationship
 
03:28:35.710 --> 03:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
between when the expenses are incurred
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
and when they draw but also you may have
 
03:28:40.110 --> 03:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
years where you incurred more expenses
 
03:28:42.630 --> 03:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
or less expenses so that number can go
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
up and down depending on how much is
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.110 --> 03:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um but as as that makes sense but
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
just in general it looks like it's
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
trending downward is there some reason
 
03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
for that or again is that just a quirk
 
03:29:05.910 --> 03:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
or because in 2021 it was 136,000 I can
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
see in
 
03:29:10.189 --> 03:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
2022 it was less than half and then 2023
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
it kind of rebounded but in general it's
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
looks like it's weakening
 
03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
well like it it does appear that the the
 
03:29:21.389 --> 03:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
trending of expenses is going up uh year
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
to year um which would ultimately drive
 
03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
down that beginning balance that makes
 
03:29:26.790 --> 03:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
sense but ultimately that beginning
 
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
balance will never we can't draw more
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
than what is available from the award so
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
yes but I would say and Patrick director
 
03:29:37.150 --> 03:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
Hackley could probably speak to this
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
more clearly but it looks like there's a
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more activity occurring in the
 
03:29:43.950 --> 03:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
last few years uh from the source of
 
03:29:49.469 --> 03:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:53.469 --> 03:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Rosen thank you I'm trying
 
03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
to waigh through this
 
03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
RSA language and it seems
 
03:30:04.990 --> 03:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
like not all of the fines go into the
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
forest protection Personnel training
 
03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:10.030 align:start position:0%
forest protection Personnel training
fund

03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:30:13.269 --> 03:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
maybe can't even tell if it's 80% or if
 
03:30:13.279 --> 03:30:14.110 align:start position:0%
maybe can't even tell if it's 80% or if
it's

03:30:14.110 --> 03:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.189 --> 03:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
go it would go into the um
 
03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
3505 the forest management protection
 
03:30:30.880 --> 03:30:36.670 align:start position:0%
3505 the forest management protection

03:30:36.670 --> 03:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and the last one oh one more
 
03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:41.790 align:start position:0%
yeah and the last one oh one more
representative

03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:30:44.830 --> 03:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
voling are the people who you send out
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:51.389 --> 03:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
they are they they staff um but we also
 
03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
have U private individuals who are
 
03:30:55.469 --> 03:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
trained that agree to go out they do get
 
03:30:57.670 --> 03:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
compensated by the forest service yeah
 
03:31:00.910 --> 03:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
the staff doesn't have to go out they
 
03:31:02.790 --> 03:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
they don't they're strongly recommended
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
for training purposes but um some
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
Rangers opt out yeah yeah sounds like a
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
pretty horrific job it's it's rugged
 
03:31:16.990 --> 03:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:23.710 --> 03:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:26.630 --> 03:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
FS um so this is a property that was
 
03:31:29.469 --> 03:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
donated to us from Carolyn
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
Fox um and she did leave a a an
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
endowment and we do use this to fund a
 
03:31:40.590 --> 03:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
we have a a Forester there that's uh
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
basically our um manager of that
 
03:31:46.269 --> 03:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
property and the buildings that that
 
03:31:47.910 --> 03:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
came with the property we did we did
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
build an educ a very small Educational
 
03:31:53.950 --> 03:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
Center on on site
 
03:31:56.510 --> 03:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and we draw from that periodically to
 
03:31:59.550 --> 03:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
pay for insurance operating costs and a
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
portion of the salary for the Forester
 
03:32:05.950 --> 03:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
goes um comes from these funds to
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:13.229 --> 03:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
person it is a research and
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
demonstration station we have workshops
 
03:32:16.429 --> 03:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
out there
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
um it's been a a great location for
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
doing civil cultural showings to to uh
 
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
help the public and other
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
Foresters understand how to manage a
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
forest for for various purposes um
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's hardwood civil culture
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
softwood Civic culture Forest Health our
 
03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
forest Health uh staff also is housed
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
there at the at the Fox Forest
 
03:32:41.670 --> 03:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
location um and so it's a really
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
important Southern Facility for our
 
03:32:46.510 --> 03:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
division and and the uh endowment fund
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
helps us maintain the property um and
 
03:32:52.150 --> 03:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned the Forester that
 
03:32:54.349 --> 03:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
manages the that
 
03:32:56.750 --> 03:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
site very good this is in the town of
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.349 --> 03:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
wer gosh I should know that off the top
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
of my head but it's probably um it's got
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
to be at least 1,200 to 1500 Acres I'm
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
putting a thumb in the air on that
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
one sure any other forestry
 
03:33:21.189 --> 03:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so now what do we do
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
go back to the beginning back to the
 
03:33:26.520 --> 03:33:28.950 align:start position:0%
go back to the beginning back to the
beginning

03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
03:33:34.229 --> 03:33:34.239 align:start position:0%
okay back to page that's number
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
13 uh 12
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
13 um North Region headquarters is that
 
03:33:47.349 --> 03:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
the one you're referring
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
to because that would fall under my
 
03:33:53.389 --> 03:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
teritory yes yes glad to skipped it yeah
 
03:33:58.710 --> 03:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's on page four yeah 7871 accounting
 
03:34:01.469 --> 03:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
unit so the North Region headquarters is
 
03:34:03.630 --> 03:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
under our divisional jurisdiction and
 
03:34:05.550 --> 03:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
under our department it's a dncr
 
03:34:09.389 --> 03:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
facility and our division manages it um
 
03:34:11.670 --> 03:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
we house our forestry staff there for
 
03:34:14.110 --> 03:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
the North Region they're responsible for
 
03:34:15.990 --> 03:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
managing our largest State Forest the
 
03:34:18.990 --> 03:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
40,000 acre Nash stream
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
Forest um we also um provide space to
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
our colleagues in in Parks and
 
03:34:27.510 --> 03:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
Recreation so Bureau of trails has a
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
couple of staff there as well um we then
 
03:34:33.790 --> 03:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
also lease space at a fairly friendly
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
rate to uh our our partners in education
 
03:34:38.670 --> 03:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
Outreach UNH Cooperative Extension has
 
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
an office there and then our colleagues
 
03:34:43.710 --> 03:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
at the fishing game uh Department also
 
03:34:46.110 --> 03:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
have office space there so it's really a
 
03:34:49.229 --> 03:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
great um nucleus of state agencies
 
03:34:51.910 --> 03:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
resource-based agencies that uh occupy
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
the North Region headquarters in
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
Lancaster um we do receive proceeds from
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
the timber taxes that are collected from
 
03:35:01.110 --> 03:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
the unorganized
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
townships and each year we present a
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
budget as a matter of fact we're
 
03:35:06.910 --> 03:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
preparing to present a budget now for
 
03:35:11.830 --> 03:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
the 2025 fiscal year to coas County and
 
03:35:14.710 --> 03:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh their Commissioners review our budget
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
and then allocate a portion of the
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
Timber taxes that are collected from the
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
unorganized townships to help fund this
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
headquarters all right so it looks like
 
03:35:34.870 --> 03:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
you you very closely keep the revenue
 
03:35:37.870 --> 03:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
and expenses uh
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
aligned yeah this one's pretty tight
 
03:35:45.309 --> 03:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
um and uh we we've we've been able to
 
03:35:48.189 --> 03:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
recently Rec we had some questions about
 
03:35:51.510 --> 03:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
the value that we we provide the the um
 
03:35:54.150 --> 03:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
the value proposition to the county uh
 
03:35:55.790 --> 03:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
but we've recently solidified that
 
03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
support we receive roughly $668,000 a
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
year from Coos County to supplement the
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:36:05.630 --> 03:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
additional uh Revenue that we need to
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
keep the the headquarters
 
03:36:10.790 --> 03:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
running and and it has become quite the
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
community center in terms of meetings
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
meeting space um there's some fine
 
03:36:18.910 --> 03:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
looking stuffed animals in there um but
 
03:36:21.269 --> 03:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
it is a well-used uh facility in
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
Lancaster for many state agencies and
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
the public so you're saying they pay
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
above the timber tax that they collect
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
not above they pay a portion of uh of
 
03:36:33.389 --> 03:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
the Timber tax
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
collected uh from the or unorganized
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
townships and that's been a ongoing
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
statutory uh you know based in statute
 
03:36:42.800 --> 03:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
statutory uh you know based in statute
for

03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
decades and it's just a negotiation as
 
03:36:49.150 --> 03:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
to what fraction of that tax they give
 
03:36:50.750 --> 03:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
you yes yeah it's it's uh it's
 
03:36:53.510 --> 03:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
negotiated between um the Commissioners
 
03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
and and me and our our division I
 
03:36:59.670 --> 03:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
see representative
 
03:37:02.510 --> 03:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you Grafton county has one
 
03:37:06.830 --> 03:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
town in this uh one town non
 
03:37:09.630 --> 03:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
toown um it actually had a resident for
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
a while
 
03:37:15.870 --> 03:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
um but on who
 
03:37:19.189 --> 03:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
who pays when there is a
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
fire in or or other violation in right
 
03:37:28.710 --> 03:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
in that area right for a wildfire um so
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
if it's in the unorganized Township we
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
do we we do look to uh the county to
 
03:37:36.990 --> 03:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
cover that but that's I think that's
 
03:37:40.590 --> 03:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
also tied into our the the allocation if
 
03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
you will that we receive from the
 
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
commission I'm not totally clear on the
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
mechanics of that
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
but um I think we look to the county if
 
03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
it occurs in an unorganized Township
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.469 --> 03:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
residents other
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
question repr on yeah there are
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
besides um summer visitors okay well
 
03:38:10.429 --> 03:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
including the summer visitors there are
 
03:38:13.389 --> 03:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
a fair number as I understand it of
 
03:38:18.710 --> 03:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
mansions hidden in the backlands of Coos
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
mhm that belong to people mostly from
 
03:38:22.110 --> 03:38:22.120 align:start position:0%
New York
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
City who only G there once a year turns
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:34.269 --> 03:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
no um we actually yes yeah so if if one
 
03:38:36.790 --> 03:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
of those Mansions happens to burn down
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
to the ground is that the problem of the
 
03:38:39.600 --> 03:38:41.070 align:start position:0%
to the ground is that the problem of the
county

03:38:41.070 --> 03:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
county
 
03:38:44.910 --> 03:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
or so we have actually in the past
 
03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:46.070 align:start position:0%
or so we have actually in the past
assisted

03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
assisted
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
um the county in in patrolling these
 
03:38:50.990 --> 03:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
back roads that have
 
03:38:53.910 --> 03:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
significant uh second homes on
 
03:38:57.510 --> 03:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
lakes and uh reported those back to the
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
um the tax administrator for the county
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
to let them know that they have a
 
03:39:03.790 --> 03:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
significant structure in the back
 
03:39:06.910 --> 03:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
country at at this point the sheriff's
 
03:39:08.670 --> 03:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
office is doing that now but they're
 
03:39:10.349 --> 03:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
spending time on those back roads to
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
quantify so there those taxes should be
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
reflected in um
 
03:39:17.469 --> 03:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
uh the property
 
03:39:19.790 --> 03:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
assessment when they know that there's a
 
03:39:21.070 --> 03:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
property out there and that that did
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
happen a lot after um covid um people
 
03:39:28.710 --> 03:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
were beefing up their camps to to to
 
03:39:31.349 --> 03:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
live more frequently up there or just
 
03:39:34.870 --> 03:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
buying leases and building significant
 
03:39:36.349 --> 03:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
structures but I I do know what you mean
 
03:39:39.910 --> 03:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
that trend has yeah occurred yeah even
 
03:39:43.389 --> 03:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
before that they I got my information
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the person that uh furnished the
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:54.670 --> 03:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
places all right the next Forest one I
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
see is number 376 on page
 
03:40:05.550 --> 03:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:10.269 --> 03:40:10.279 align:start position:0%
37 um marac River Basin oh yeah all
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
Forest management and silvicultural
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
operations on federal lands it's a
 
03:40:24.189 --> 03:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
license with the Army Core of Engineers
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
oh yes yeah I can explain that one so in
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
addition page 32 yes um yep uh
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
5019 Forest management civil cultural
 
03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
operations on federal lands so very
 
03:40:39.910 --> 03:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
similar to our relationship with New
 
03:40:42.429 --> 03:40:42.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game department we
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
also manage about 13,000 acres for the
 
03:40:46.630 --> 03:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
US Army Corps of
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
Engineers so as many of you know um when
 
03:40:52.349 --> 03:40:52.359 align:start position:0%
the federal land dams up land they they
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
acquire lands around it um flood plane
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
lands if you will and this agency
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
contracts with us well we have a anou or
 
03:41:06.429 --> 03:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
an MOA to provide Force Management
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
Services on their property and that
 
03:41:13.229 --> 03:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
supports a Forester that is on our staff
 
03:41:14.950 --> 03:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
so there are no General funds here we
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
rely this fund to support um I think
 
03:41:21.110 --> 03:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
just one
 
03:41:25.389 --> 03:41:25.399 align:start position:0%
Forester um and but it also um provides
 
03:41:29.229 --> 03:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
funding for mowing uh we we contract
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
with a an outside consultant to mow um
 
03:41:35.349 --> 03:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
the areas around the dam so basically
 
03:41:37.030 --> 03:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
are the land manager for the US Army
 
03:41:42.710 --> 03:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.429 --> 03:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
Engineers representative m
 
03:41:50.790 --> 03:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's not just um the miramac River Basin
 
03:41:54.149 --> 03:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's also some it's prominy the marac
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
River Basin um yeah there it says right
 
03:41:59.550 --> 03:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
there it says 11,700 my understanding is
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's closer to 13 so they maybe um I
 
03:42:04.269 --> 03:42:04.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if that includes the
 
03:42:07.309 --> 03:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
Blackwater area the Blackwater Dam Area
 
03:42:09.990 --> 03:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of in that hopkington
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
um kukuk area but we we have done Forest
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
operations on other
 
03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
um Army Corps properties and that may be
 
03:42:20.710 --> 03:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
the balance of the 13,000 Acres I'm
 
03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:24.670 align:start position:0%
the balance of the 13,000 Acres I'm
thinking

03:42:24.670 --> 03:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
of yeah that's what it does okay um any
 
03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
questions on this
 
03:42:33.710 --> 03:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
one all right good
 
03:42:37.149 --> 03:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
um so any other Forest I didn't see any
 
03:42:37.159 --> 03:42:46.189 align:start position:0%
um so any other Forest I didn't see any
but

03:42:46.189 --> 03:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:48.389 --> 03:42:48.399 align:start position:0%
do you do mining
 
03:42:50.510 --> 03:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
much we're hoping you Wen going to bring
 
03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:50.790 align:start position:0%
much we're hoping you Wen going to bring
that

03:42:50.790 --> 03:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:50.800 --> 03:42:52.750 align:start position:0%
that
[Laughter]

03:42:52.750 --> 03:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:42:55.950 --> 03:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
up ridiculously
 
03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
it's we we can speak to it when I when I
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
started in this position I thought oh
 
03:43:04.189 --> 03:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
wow mining we might be able to find a
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
fortune that's not that's not happening
 
03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
no no it's more of a a chore than a
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
benefit it's one of those things we were
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
as an agency saddled with here it's like
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
here you take the mining um activity so
 
03:43:19.630 --> 03:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
director Marino and I had page 15 yeah
 
03:43:21.550 --> 03:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
let's go to the page and um we'll talk
 
03:43:24.189 --> 03:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
about it a little bit so we lease out
 
03:43:26.630 --> 03:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
State Reservation land for mining
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
permits um but we also are obligated
 
03:43:33.309 --> 03:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
under the statute to uh monitor mining
 
03:43:36.750 --> 03:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
operations on private land um so it
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
falls to us and um the permit fees over
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
time have accumulated to this amount
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
that you see in the in the table
 
03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a fairly lengthy
 
03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
RSA um but our obligations are to
 
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
monitor to
 
03:43:56.510 --> 03:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
inspect um and to ensure that there's a
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
mining plan associated with these
 
03:43:59.199 --> 03:44:00.790 align:start position:0%
mining plan associated with these
mines

03:44:00.790 --> 03:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
mines
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
um this is handled by Our Land
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau
 
03:44:09.870 --> 03:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
staff um the funny you see there has has
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
probably been there for quite some time
 
03:44:14.149 --> 03:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
a number of years we have not tapped
 
03:44:16.389 --> 03:44:16.399 align:start position:0%
into it to ad ad Minister this act
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
basically what the fund what the statute
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
says is um these funds may be used to
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
administer the ACT which is very
 
03:44:26.670 --> 03:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and um doesn't really help us
 
03:44:28.910 --> 03:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of what what we can use the
 
03:44:32.830 --> 03:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
money for so either we we would seek
 
03:44:34.590 --> 03:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
legislative or either through rules or
 
03:44:36.510 --> 03:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
legislative action of some kind seek to
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
be able to tap those funds for the
 
03:44:41.950 --> 03:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
administration of the monitoring and in
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
case of
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
disputes we sometimes need to incur
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
costs um for instance we had an AB
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
budding land owner who was upset with
 
03:44:52.710 --> 03:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
the noise being made by the mining
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
operation um we started to work with our
 
03:44:57.910 --> 03:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
doj attorney we were going to conduct a
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
deciel study of the mining activity the
 
03:45:03.389 --> 03:45:03.399 align:start position:0%
quote we got from the contractor was
 
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
about $5,000 which was half of what our
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
balance is in this fund um but we
 
03:45:10.189 --> 03:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
weren't really able to tap it because
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
the language in this RSA isn't really
 
03:45:15.149 --> 03:45:15.159 align:start position:0%
explicit is that a fair characterization
 
03:45:15.159 --> 03:45:16.950 align:start position:0%
explicit is that a fair characterization
director

03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
director
 
03:45:19.790 --> 03:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
Marino yes I would say that was would
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
probably be a good interpretation uh we
 
03:45:24.750 --> 03:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
we did just discussed it recently um
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
because of the vaguery of the chapter
 
03:45:28.110 --> 03:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
and it does say administration of the
 
03:45:32.910 --> 03:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
chapter um we're I'm inclined to think
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
that this is an exercise that would fall
 
03:45:38.750 --> 03:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
within the authority of this chapter so
 
03:45:41.229 --> 03:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
I'm inclined to to say yes go ahead with
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
that but I'm glad we're having an
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity to met to talk about this
 
03:45:46.590 --> 03:45:46.600 align:start position:0%
now yeah um just in case there's any
 
03:45:50.110 --> 03:45:50.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to see clarification on
 
03:45:52.229 --> 03:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
wer this is mostly dirt and gravel right
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
or u a hobby mineral collection um
 
03:46:01.830 --> 03:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
quartz and then there's barrel and
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
there's some other precious gems that
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
that these miners are after but uh it
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
actually it's not some of it's um uh
 
03:46:13.229 --> 03:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
surface uh uh Granite quaries where the
 
03:46:15.870 --> 03:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
slabs left over from from actual
 
03:46:17.630 --> 03:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
drilling are now being sold because they
 
03:46:20.110 --> 03:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
have value yeah we have one like that in
 
03:46:23.790 --> 03:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
Fitz William I believe thank you do you
 
03:46:26.189 --> 03:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
have a full-time employee dealing with
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
mines or no not she does not deal with
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's really this extra work and to be
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
honest the the state geologist I think
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
is housed at
 
03:46:41.469 --> 03:46:41.479 align:start position:0%
Dees yes and so yeah and so this is in
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
my opinion something worth considering
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
where does this belong
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
um because it really is sort of an
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
afterthought with our staff because it's
 
03:46:55.149 --> 03:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
not a primary function but uh we do get
 
03:46:59.110 --> 03:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
calls or complaints or or um inquiries
 
03:47:01.149 --> 03:47:01.159 align:start position:0%
about this
 
03:47:03.550 --> 03:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility I see so you would like
 
03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
to have the state geologist or you'd
 
03:47:07.229 --> 03:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
like to get rid of this
 
03:47:10.110 --> 03:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
fund I think the state geologist would
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
be better suited to oversee this type of
 
03:47:15.790 --> 03:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
work right but should the state
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
geologist work for Department of Natural
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
Resources or Dees right do you I think
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's a conversation I'm willing to
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
have with Dees I don't know specifically
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
what other roles and responsibilities
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
the geologist has okay that that would
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
benefit either uh agency I mean we all
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
all agencies try our best to look beyond
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
the The Branding of the agency so we're
 
03:47:42.149 --> 03:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
all on the same page um but this is one
 
03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
that has um bubbled up in conversations
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
as let's let's look at this a little
 
03:47:49.469 --> 03:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
closer and talk to Dees and see if it
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
has a better home over there or vice
 
03:47:54.670 --> 03:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:59.910 --> 03:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
right now um are the fees involved here
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
adequate to the the work that they the
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
minds cause or
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
not well
 
03:48:11.870 --> 03:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question we I'm
 
03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
beginning to think no given the current
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
stat in we have now we recently moved
 
03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:17.830 align:start position:0%
stat in we have now we recently moved
our

03:48:17.830 --> 03:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
Communications section out of Land
 
03:48:21.469 --> 03:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
Management Bureau and we created our own
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
Communications Bureau so that's freed up
 
03:48:25.469 --> 03:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
our Land Management Bureau staff to
 
03:48:27.550 --> 03:48:27.560 align:start position:0%
spend more time this has been something
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's like we manage it when we have
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
time or when a problem comes up and we
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
have to address it so our current
 
03:48:36.510 --> 03:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
administrator for the Land Management
 
03:48:39.189 --> 03:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau very detail oriented she has
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
spent time visiting all of the permitted
 
03:48:42.750 --> 03:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
sites I don't know if she's got to all
 
03:48:44.429 --> 03:48:44.439 align:start position:0%
of them but she's tried to get to all of
 
03:48:47.510 --> 03:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
them to re-engage with these uh
 
03:48:50.910 --> 03:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
permites uh and I would say in this past
 
03:48:52.990 --> 03:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
year that the fees that we collected
 
03:48:55.189 --> 03:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably did not cover much of her time
 
03:48:55.199 --> 03:48:57.189 align:start position:0%
probably did not cover much of her time
in

03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
general all right so maybe we need
 
03:49:04.030 --> 03:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
higher fees here so
 
03:49:07.630 --> 03:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
um how about um commissioner we ask you
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
to get together with um either the
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Dees or the state G
 
03:49:15.630 --> 03:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
geologist or both and and
 
03:49:19.630 --> 03:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
make a plan for what you want to do um
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
and we can maybe support you with
 
03:49:26.550 --> 03:49:26.560 align:start position:0%
legislation um if you get it to us uh by
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
the end of October kind of thing all
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
right I can do that all right thank you
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
all right other
 
03:49:35.870 --> 03:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions here
 
03:49:38.910 --> 03:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
nope okay any
 
03:49:41.309 --> 03:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
others that are that are
 
03:49:45.309 --> 03:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
forc none that are mine right do we see
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
any no should we go back to the
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
beginning yeah the next Canon we're
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
getting to Canon Mountain this one has
 
03:49:54.000 --> 03:49:54.830 align:start position:0%
getting to Canon Mountain this one has
the

03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
so all right we are on page
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
five Canon Mountain ski account that
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
important Brian I'll let you introduce
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
this one sure uh good afternoon everyone
 
03:50:26.229 --> 03:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm Brian Wilson I'm the director of the
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
division of Parks and
 
03:50:30.269 --> 03:50:30.279 align:start position:0%
Recreation uh the Canon Mountain ski
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
accounts is um uh two um accounting
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
units um that um are part broad part of
 
03:50:41.469 --> 03:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
our of the state park fund um that are
 
03:50:45.429 --> 03:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
isolated out to um um
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
um specifically on the operate the ski
 
03:50:50.950 --> 03:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
and winter Recreation components of uh
 
03:50:52.830 --> 03:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh within frankone not State Park which
 
03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
is Canon Mountain ski area uh the resort
 
03:50:58.189 --> 03:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
and the um operation of the aerial
 
03:51:01.309 --> 03:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
Tramway uh within the uh the two
 
03:51:03.750 --> 03:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
different accounting units uh one is uh
 
03:51:06.990 --> 03:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
primarily the uh 3303 that's the the
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
operations unit uh which is you know the
 
03:51:12.309 --> 03:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
staff uh maintenance equipment
 
03:51:15.070 --> 03:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
operations and then the 3704
 
03:51:18.189 --> 03:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh unit is our concession and Retail uh
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
functions which include like our ski
 
03:51:22.670 --> 03:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
school our rental shop uh the
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
concessions agreements that we have uh
 
03:51:27.630 --> 03:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
which we contract out uh by and large
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
for uh food and beverage and uh other
 
03:51:46.189 --> 03:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
they also get money from the Hampton
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
Beach meters which yet is a pretty
 
03:51:55.469 --> 03:51:55.479 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money that's
 
03:52:00.590 --> 03:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:04.149 --> 03:52:04.159 align:start position:0%
105 yeah so if I may just just clarify
 
03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh how that works so the the there's a
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
ski account and the park account those
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
those two components which make up
 
03:52:13.630 --> 03:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately what they call the Park fund
 
03:52:15.790 --> 03:52:15.800 align:start position:0%
so the ski account is confined to what
 
03:52:17.309 --> 03:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
director Wilson just described which is
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
accounting in 3703 which is the
 
03:52:22.429 --> 03:52:22.439 align:start position:0%
operations 3704 which is the retail and
 
03:52:27.070 --> 03:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
concessions that's the ski account 7300
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
which is Hampton meters is part of the
 
03:52:33.309 --> 03:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
broader service Park group of accounting
 
03:52:36.469 --> 03:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
units which includes 3720 which is
 
03:52:39.429 --> 03:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
service park operations 7300 which is
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
Hampton meters those go together uh to
 
03:52:47.990 --> 03:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
comprise the Park account so although
 
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
related ultimately under under the the
 
03:52:54.070 --> 03:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
park operations system um the Hampton
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
meters function is a is a component of
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
the service Park account versus the
 
03:53:03.309 --> 03:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
Canon ski account I just wanted to
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that for you just so you
 
03:53:04.680 --> 03:53:06.189 align:start position:0%
clarify that for you just so you
understood

03:53:06.189 --> 03:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
understood
 
03:53:11.950 --> 03:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
that but that money doesn't go to the
 
03:53:15.429 --> 03:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
the Canon Mountain it goes to the summer
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
activities are we talking about Hampton
 
03:53:19.870 --> 03:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
meters yes Hampton meters
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
supports the park operation system
 
03:53:27.309 --> 03:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
service park operations system um not
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
directly the Canon Mountain operations
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
system so first of all should we create
 
03:53:37.030 --> 03:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
another dedicated fund because you're
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're reporting to us like they're two
 
03:53:42.630 --> 03:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
separate funds state park account number
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
33 and then the second one
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
um one is Canon and one is others well I
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
don't know well they're both under 26
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
and a3i they're both under RSA 612
 
03:53:55.600 --> 03:53:56.389 align:start position:0%
and a3i they're both under RSA 612
number

03:53:56.389 --> 03:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:53:59.550 --> 03:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
33 but you'll notice one is described as
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
the Canon Mountain ski account and one
 
03:54:04.030 --> 03:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
is described as the state park account
 
03:54:05.710 --> 03:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
right and within the state park account
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that notated in the
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
detailed activity section 7300 which is
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampton meters is captured in that yes
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
in that
 
03:54:20.349 --> 03:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
account oh I see but this is all Canon
 
03:54:23.309 --> 03:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
mountain right it doesn't include the
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
other parks around the state uh the
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
first part of the discussion yes Canon
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
Mount you're discussing only the Canon
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
Mountain ski account yes that contains
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
only the Canon Mountain
 
03:54:37.790 --> 03:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
activities and the second one includes
 
03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
all of the other Parks correct because
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
that wasn't at all clear yes and please
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
remember that we don't charge at all of
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
our Parks some of our Parks don't that
 
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
we do charge at don't create a big
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
enough Revenue to support themselves so
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that State Park fund where the
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
Hampton tolls are part of that really
 
03:55:03.170 --> 03:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:03.180 --> 03:55:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:55:09.510 --> 03:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
system do do money collected at other
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
state parks go to Canon or vice
 
03:55:16.349 --> 03:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.149 --> 03:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
no no the the the funding the revenue
 
03:55:22.510 --> 03:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
collected at state parks around the
 
03:55:25.630 --> 03:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
state stay within the service Park
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
system the park ski
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
account only Revenue collected at the
 
03:55:34.030 --> 03:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain ski
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
area is in the actual Canon Mountain ski
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
account okay so in this Canon Mountain
 
03:55:41.670 --> 03:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
account you're spending you're receiving
 
03:55:44.309 --> 03:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
and spending $10 million a year
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
approximately yes roughly um but all
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
those expenses are at Canam correct and
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
all the revenue is from skiers yes okay
 
03:55:58.349 --> 03:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
okay with all right so maybe that should
 
03:56:01.429 --> 03:56:01.439 align:start position:0%
be its own dedicated fund without
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
mixing in in fund 33 all the other stuff
 
03:56:07.870 --> 03:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree
 
03:56:10.189 --> 03:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
okay well that's something we can do
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
question yes Senator we have other funds
 
03:56:23.710 --> 03:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
that only have one number but have two
 
03:56:26.830 --> 03:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
sheets in the book right yes which this
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
would lend itself to without any
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
legislative action right well there's
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's a there's statutory uses and
 
03:56:37.630 --> 03:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
then there's how we account for it in
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
the accounting system so different
 
03:56:41.349 --> 03:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
agencies choose to put things in
 
03:56:43.189 --> 03:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
different accounting units or you can
 
03:56:45.030 --> 03:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
see all the narrative that describes all
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
the back and forth between all the
 
03:56:48.550 --> 03:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
accounting units that's up to the agency
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
but we just need to follow the statutory
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
uses of the underlying statute and if it
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't require multiple dedicated funds
 
03:56:58.990 --> 03:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
the agency can choose to use the
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
accounting system to do whatever
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
internal calculations they need to do
 
03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
let me try to translate that and see
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
what I heard okay okay if they use
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
different accounting units even though
 
03:57:13.349 --> 03:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
it only has one dedicated fund number
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
it'll do
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
what you really want it to do without
 
03:57:21.790 --> 03:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
any other modification at all no change
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the RSA no anything else just you
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
guys picking a different accounting
 
03:57:29.670 --> 03:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
number all right well it's I guess it
 
03:57:31.830 --> 03:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
would be up if if if it's causing a
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
strain on their uh tracking then there
 
03:57:37.469 --> 03:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
may be a benefit to give it its own RSA
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
612 ID number which gives it its own
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
place in the book but I mean I that's
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
why I defer the agency if they're if
 
03:57:47.510 --> 03:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're working the accounting system
 
03:57:49.630 --> 03:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
which is robust enough to handle all
 
03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
this it's just this book is at a much
 
03:57:51.479 --> 03:57:52.469 align:start position:0%
this it's just this book is at a much
higher

03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
higher
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
level yeah to to be clear so I think
 
03:57:58.189 --> 03:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
they're grouped correctly in terms of
 
03:58:00.670 --> 03:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
the accounting units so the ski account
 
03:58:03.030 --> 03:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
there are two accounting units grouped
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the park operations this park
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
account there are actually four
 
03:58:09.189 --> 03:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
accounting units that are grouped I
 
03:58:11.149 --> 03:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
think the confusion here is they're both
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
both of those accounts while grouped
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
separately in the accounting system are
 
03:58:20.429 --> 03:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
identified with the same ID number RS ID
 
03:58:22.429 --> 03:58:22.439 align:start position:0%
number RSA ID number so if they had
 
03:58:24.870 --> 03:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
different say idea numbers that would
 
03:58:26.550 --> 03:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
make it a little clearer on your part to
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
be able to see 33 is Canon Etc 34 is
 
03:58:35.149 --> 03:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
Parks Etc if that's I think that's what
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about yes yeah okay but
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's another problem that 33
 
03:58:45.630 --> 03:58:45.640 align:start position:0%
isn't Canon it's Canon ski
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
area and the the other one is Canon and
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
all the other parks in there and canon
 
03:58:58.830 --> 03:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
in its uh function as the rest of the
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
Mountain of can so if I'm understanding
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
I think what you're referring to is
 
03:59:04.950 --> 03:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
Canon mountain in the winter is the
 
03:59:07.510 --> 03:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
canon skia in the summer is francon not
 
03:59:10.469 --> 03:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
state park is that yeah okay yes that
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's confusing I I agree with that as
 
03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
well um that's kind of a more difficult
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
thing to to identify because you have
 
03:59:20.269 --> 03:59:20.279 align:start position:0%
summer operations
 
03:59:23.189 --> 03:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
occurring and going to One account and
 
03:59:25.510 --> 03:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
winter operations occurring and going to
 
03:59:28.149 --> 03:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
a different account um but that that
 
03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's really the only exception in this
 
03:59:31.870 --> 03:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
case that makes that creates a little
 
03:59:33.550 --> 03:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
bit of that
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
confusion so you're saying that
 
03:59:38.429 --> 03:59:38.439 align:start position:0%
accounting units 373 and
 
03:59:41.309 --> 03:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
3704 are only for
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
skiing they're they're only for skiing
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
they only with the exception no with the
 
03:59:51.269 --> 03:59:51.279 align:start position:0%
exception of Summer operations on Canon
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
Mountain for the operation of the tram
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
but everything else that occurs up there
 
03:59:59.389 --> 03:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
is Franconia Notch State
 
04:00:02.189 --> 04:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
Park oh okay yes that all stays in the
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
service Park account okay so the tram is
 
04:00:08.750 --> 04:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
always part of this cannon ski thing
 
04:00:14.830 --> 04:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
not sure if I answered the question but
 
04:00:18.309 --> 04:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
I think you can do it either way need a
 
04:00:21.750 --> 04:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
field trip pretty much it's up to you
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
guys if you want to change you're G to
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
have to come ask us okay
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I I looked at this and I thought
 
04:00:35.630 --> 04:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
that we had these four income sections
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
all coming into Cannon Mountains
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
mountain basically to keep camon
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
Mountain alive right and which is the
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
one that you took
 
04:00:48.670 --> 04:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
sonap right and and and because they're
 
04:00:52.110 --> 04:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
designated with the same ID of number 33
 
04:00:54.229 --> 04:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
it does appear that way and I understand
 
04:00:55.590 --> 04:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
now what you're what you're talking
 
04:00:55.600 --> 04:00:59.790 align:start position:0%
now what you're what you're talking
about

04:00:59.790 --> 04:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.149 --> 04:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
yes maybe maybe I'll talk to somebody on
 
04:01:07.630 --> 04:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
the resources committee that makes sense
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
if any of them I think you have in the
 
04:01:13.229 --> 04:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
past changed the names of the ID numbers
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I think we did did that with pasas a
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
year or two ago if you wanted to clarify
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
the naming convention but uh yeah I I
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
think that yeah if you want it crystal
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
clear you would give it two ID numbers
 
04:01:28.030 --> 04:01:28.040 align:start position:0%
and call it what you want to call it and
 
04:01:31.950 --> 04:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
that would clarify it yeah yeah
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay all right so the second half of
 
04:01:37.990 --> 04:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
this one is
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
Parks so that's ACC counting
 
04:01:45.790 --> 04:01:45.800 align:start position:0%
unit uh 3701 3 72
 
04:01:45.800 --> 04:01:47.870 align:start position:0%
unit uh 3701 3 72
3720

04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
3720
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
3722 Etc right there's a lot of them
 
04:01:52.880 --> 04:01:55.389 align:start position:0%
3722 Etc right there's a lot of them
that's

04:01:55.389 --> 04:01:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:55.399 --> 04:01:58.030 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:01:58.030 --> 04:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:02:01.950 --> 04:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay and it's all the state parks yeah
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay including and
 
04:02:10.229 --> 04:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
mountain in it right other including
 
04:02:16.670 --> 04:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
um so this
 
04:02:26.510 --> 04:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
fund seems to again match revenue and
 
04:02:28.269 --> 04:02:28.279 align:start position:0%
expenses quite
 
04:02:28.279 --> 04:02:32.790 align:start position:0%
expenses quite
well

04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:36.910 --> 04:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
yeah with with a fairly sizable
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
cushion but not
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
excessive I had a note that the Au
 
04:02:43.389 --> 04:02:43.399 align:start position:0%
numbers were sometimes wrong in the
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
report but maybe that's because I wasn't
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
understanding what went
 
04:02:47.680 --> 04:02:51.389 align:start position:0%
understanding what went
where

04:02:51.389 --> 04:02:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.990 --> 04:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so for if I could just say the
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
balance here is really important to us
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
if there's a rainy summer for example
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
still want to pay our
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
employees um and uh and so I'm proud of
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
of this balance and would like to keep
 
04:03:07.399 --> 04:03:10.990 align:start position:0%
of this balance and would like to keep
it

04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:13.469 --> 04:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
sure yeah it looks like uh you have some
 
04:03:15.149 --> 04:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
years where you have a little excess and
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
some years where yeah expenses are a
 
04:03:18.479 --> 04:03:22.590 align:start position:0%
some years where yeah expenses are a
little

04:03:22.590 --> 04:03:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
high let's talk about that why why did
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
expenses go up I is that mostly the the
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
increase in salaries yes um we um absorb
 
04:03:35.269 --> 04:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
the 12% wage increases across the the
 
04:03:38.030 --> 04:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
whole division here and um with without
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
any general funding support so uh that's
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
that's one factor uh in addition to that
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh with kind of the um um increase in
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
visitation Trends really Nationwide and
 
04:03:51.359 --> 04:03:52.429 align:start position:0%
visitation Trends really Nationwide and
outdoor

04:03:52.429 --> 04:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
outdoor
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
recreation uh the um slight change in uh
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
climate with our shoulder Seasons
 
04:04:01.870 --> 04:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
seeming to be ever expanding uh the
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
demand on the park system is um no
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
longer a memorial day through Labor Day
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
operation so we've had to build out
 
04:04:11.070 --> 04:04:11.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing structure and other resources
 
04:04:14.189 --> 04:04:14.199 align:start position:0%
to uh meet that demand so that has also
 
04:04:17.429 --> 04:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
pushed um kind of uh an increased burden
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
on on on the expenditure side so we need
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
to increase some fees then well we have
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
been doing that incrementally over the
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
last uh year or so um we went to we got
 
04:04:30.510 --> 04:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
approval through the fiscal committee uh
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
last year to uh increase the um Hampton
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
meters account so that again that that
 
04:04:38.910 --> 04:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
goes back into this fund um after costs
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
um so we we've increased the parking
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
meters cost we um Revisited our
 
04:04:44.990 --> 04:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
Campground fee structure increased that
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
at approximately 20% uh last year really
 
04:04:52.750 --> 04:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
the main uh thing that's left now is uh
 
04:04:55.830 --> 04:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
to contemplate his dayuse visitation uh
 
04:04:57.469 --> 04:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
so that's where you know Park admissions
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
where we're collecting uh Park Park fees
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
and we've been looking at that and
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
studying that and there there was a
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
there was a bill last session on that
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
and they'll be actually there the um
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
rr&amp;d is taking that up a study committee
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
I believe they kick that off next week
 
04:05:14.510 --> 04:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll be kind of tracking that um and
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
um hopefully working with them on some
 
04:05:20.469 --> 04:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
solutions here to um keep our our goal
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
really here is to try to you know with
 
04:05:24.750 --> 04:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
in our self-funding model is to keep
 
04:05:27.630 --> 04:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
costs as as as as low as we can for
 
04:05:29.070 --> 04:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
folks to be able to come and camp and
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
visit the parks um but also because we
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't get general fund support we need
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're we're we're
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
tracking uh very closely on on the whole
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
picture here so that we can remain um in
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
this solvent State here and that fund
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
balance there is is nice to be able to
 
04:05:46.990 --> 04:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
have and to look at knowing that we've
 
04:05:49.149 --> 04:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
got a little bit of of cushion there for
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
years where we go in One Direction or or
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
the other or on occasion there's certain
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities that that come across that
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
are kind of a once in a generation thing
 
04:06:00.429 --> 04:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
for that we would want to um take
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
advantage of and then there's the
 
04:06:06.510 --> 04:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
weather which is our toughest
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
challenge okay so but it sounds like
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
you're that's all in progress now this
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
is your comment yes yeah um no not over
 
04:06:19.149 --> 04:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
there oh yeah that that was my
 
04:06:21.389 --> 04:06:21.399 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding okay gotta I was trying
 
04:06:21.399 --> 04:06:22.110 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding okay gotta I was trying
to

04:06:22.110 --> 04:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:06:26.910 --> 04:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
simplify a long I understand okay other
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
questions about fund
 
04:06:32.670 --> 04:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
33 well I'm wondering do you have any
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
place in the the um fishing game on
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
Rescue operation problem um do we have a
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
role in in that um yes um in certain
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
parks and places we we are pretty
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
prevalent in in inner operations with
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
them primarily Mount madno um generally
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
speaking our our staff Park staff are
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
the First on scene uh for pretty much
 
04:07:05.149 --> 04:07:05.159 align:start position:0%
any rescue uh on the mountain um because
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
we're there all of the time um so while
 
04:07:09.309 --> 04:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
fishing game may be in the area or have
 
04:07:10.830 --> 04:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
to come from somewhere outside we're
 
04:07:12.070 --> 04:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
usually the first to hear about it and
 
04:07:14.830 --> 04:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
the first to respond uh similarly uh
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington that that occurs um as
 
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
well too um but I mean it comes up all
 
04:07:24.189 --> 04:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
the time at at different places where um
 
04:07:27.109 --> 04:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
we we work uh hand inand with them uh
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
for for rescue stuff and then we also
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot a lot of uh interaction
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
relative to um enforcement and oversight
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
of the trail
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
system question represent W now that the
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
search and rescue fund is healthy from
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
the I safety pass do you does your staff
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
get any piece of that in it's rescue
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
operations no we don't what funds that
 
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
the the the help um that's a fishing
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
game fund so I'm not I know what what
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
what funds are yeah are um fees fees for
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
visiting a park so if somebody pays to
 
04:08:07.510 --> 04:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
go hike Mount manad and they're paying
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
to park um that's funding the staff that
 
04:08:15.109 --> 04:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
are there and um so that's a re source
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
that that is covered under that
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
similarly to Ocean rescue you know we
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
you know several hundred rescues happen
 
04:08:24.189 --> 04:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
every year along the Sea Coast from our
 
04:08:26.910 --> 04:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
lifeguard staff um so while it might not
 
04:08:28.710 --> 04:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
be in the back country or on top of a
 
04:08:33.070 --> 04:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
mountain it's still um life or death and
 
04:08:35.830 --> 04:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
um those those costs are collected
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
fees question
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
other questions no okay let's go on
 
04:08:52.149 --> 04:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
to um what's next
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
60 is i' I'd regard it as a oneof oh
 
04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay but I think it does it can be
 
04:09:12.030 --> 04:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
grouped with a few other things I mean
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
do you want to do you have others that
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
you deal with that you we could get you
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
done sort of yeah a long list of them
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
and number referencing do you have this
 
04:09:31.389 --> 04:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
report this 36 page yeah so we're just
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
going numerically here so there's 60
 
04:09:38.269 --> 04:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
page except for the groupings that are
 
04:09:38.279 --> 04:09:39.149 align:start position:0%
page except for the groupings that are
really

04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
obvious yeah sorry Mr chair the the memo
 
04:09:45.389 --> 04:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
they were instructed to follow the order
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
of the big book so they're not in the
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
same order as what you're looking at I
 
04:09:52.030 --> 04:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
see based on how we
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
normally is in the order of when the
 
04:09:58.349 --> 04:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund was created
 
04:10:01.950 --> 04:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
oh or it made sense actually for a while
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
because we oh it's not in the order of
 
04:10:06.070 --> 04:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
created all of these numbers from
 
04:10:09.149 --> 04:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
scratch 22 years ago something like that
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the the book is in the order of the
 
04:10:14.950 --> 04:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
RSA ID number with in the agency itself
 
04:10:17.189 --> 04:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
so that this agency has a section of the
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
book and it starts with 9 all right so
 
04:10:24.070 --> 04:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's that really can't be changed it
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with how they
 
04:10:28.189 --> 04:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
coordinate their divisions I see the RSA
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
number I have a key
 
04:10:37.149 --> 04:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
here there you go all right so the RSA
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
number it's not I think you wanted to go
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:46.349 --> 04:10:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh six we haven't done 60 yet that's
 
04:10:47.990 --> 04:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
conservation plate
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
fund right but I thought in the Park
 
04:10:53.429 --> 04:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
theme right in the Park theme the Park
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
theme I thought 104 was next okay that's
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
good all right 104 Capital Canam
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
Mountain Capital Improvements yeah i'
 
04:11:02.269 --> 04:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
put that
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
one on there all right and I believe
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
that that is just for Canon Mountain
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes so so the Canon Mountain
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement fund
 
04:11:18.910 --> 04:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
um was established when um um the lease
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
of Mount sopy um was was was established
 
04:11:27.109 --> 04:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
so uh under that uh lease agreement um
 
04:11:31.870 --> 04:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
revenues um from Mount snipy um go to
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
this Canon Mountain Capital Improvement
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
fund which is specific to uh Capital
 
04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
Improvement projects um and there is a
 
04:11:44.070 --> 04:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain advisory uh committee
 
04:11:49.030 --> 04:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
um who oversees the uh um administration
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
of those funds so they meet two to three
 
04:11:54.990 --> 04:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
times a year um and review the financial
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
statements from Mount sopy and the the
 
04:12:00.070 --> 04:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue that is generated for that
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
that goes into this fund and our team at
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain generate a list of uh
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
Capital needs um and we we um work to
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know keep up with the capital there
 
04:12:15.670 --> 04:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
um there's a essentially it's a $6
 
04:12:18.269 --> 04:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
million line of credit that U we have a
 
04:12:21.149 --> 04:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
bonding Authority um to to have a a
 
04:12:24.389 --> 04:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
revolving Bond um so the the revenue
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
from Canon Mountain pays down the
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
balance of that and then we um determine
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
which you know projects are going to
 
04:12:34.349 --> 04:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
happen on on the next cycle and fund
 
04:12:36.910 --> 04:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
them through this
 
04:12:39.309 --> 04:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
Source how is the revenue divided
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
between this fund and the other
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
one and and um and the Canon uh the
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
Canon section um there's no revenue from
 
04:12:52.710 --> 04:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
sopi that goes into the operating budget
 
04:12:55.870 --> 04:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
of Canon oh this is Sun I'm sorry this
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
is just I see yeah I think the confusion
 
04:12:59.630 --> 04:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
was you mentioned Canon Mountain as the
 
04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue um sopy is the source
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
of revenue for this yeah I was but it's
 
04:13:08.950 --> 04:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
yeah under funding source number one
 
04:13:08.960 --> 04:13:10.349 align:start position:0%
yeah under funding source number one
Canon

04:13:10.349 --> 04:13:10.359 align:start position:0%
Canon
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
Mountain yeah is this restricted to
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
Canon Mountain if you ran out of things
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
to do we will never run out of things to
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
do at Canon Mountain um um in fact it's
 
04:13:26.189 --> 04:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
it's quite the opposite where where the
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
the Six Million uh bonding limit is is
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
is is not really able to to keep Pace
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
well really more the the annual revenue
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
that we get from sunap ranges somewhere
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
between four to $600,000 a year
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
depending depending on the year um so
 
04:13:46.349 --> 04:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
um that's generally about how much we're
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
trying to um um target for Capital
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
Year yes represent J is that 400,000 uh
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
gross or
 
04:14:04.030 --> 04:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
net that that's gross revenue is only
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
400,000 from um no so um Chris can help
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
me here there's a couple different
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
components of that yeah so let me just
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
that service needs to be paid um so The
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
Debt Service typically represents a
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
component of principal and interest so
 
04:14:38.030 --> 04:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
in this case snipy right now we're
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
generating it's a little more it's
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
probably we've been doing pretty well
 
04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
been coming in somewhere around 700
 
04:14:47.149 --> 04:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
,000 um but what happens is when we use
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
that money to pay the debt service if
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
the debt service is
 
04:14:54.189 --> 04:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
$600,000 for the for a particular
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
year only a portion of that $600,000
 
04:15:00.109 --> 04:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
will now become available again for
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
rebonding in this case it's typically
 
04:15:04.349 --> 04:15:04.359 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the $ four to $500,000 a
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
year range so we pay
 
04:15:10.990 --> 04:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
600,000 a portion of that pays interest
 
04:15:12.710 --> 04:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
so we're we're trending somewhere around
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
having on a yearly basis available as
 
04:15:16.189 --> 04:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
long as we maintain that Debt Service
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
payment schedule somewhere around
 
04:15:21.229 --> 04:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
$400,000 a year but we do have to
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
monitor how much we continue to
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
incur um to make sure that we don't get
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
to a point where our debt service per
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
year exceeds the amount of Revenue that
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
that sunap is generating we haven't
 
04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
reached that threshold we're we're still
 
04:15:39.550 --> 04:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
safe um so we're able to continue to
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
keep redrawing that principle to
 
04:15:44.830 --> 04:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
maximize that million doll authorization
 
04:15:46.510 --> 04:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
but we do have to actively monitor that
 
04:15:50.229 --> 04:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
depending on uh the ability of centipede
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
to generate that Revenue which we
 
04:15:54.910 --> 04:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
receive a percentage of 2016 was a great
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
example the winter was virtually
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
non-existent um and it it was before I
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
became commissioner just to know
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh and uh significant drop in
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue that year did cause a bit of a
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
deficit for a a short period of time but
 
04:16:13.030 --> 04:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
we were able to regain that very recover
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
that very quickly yes representative W
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
have we had any projection on the um
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
projected life of the aerial
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
Tramway that'll be very expensive when
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
that needs to be so yes so we're on year
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
three or four of noodling the future of
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
the tram um and uh you know raised the
 
04:16:38.429 --> 04:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
um the awareness that the future of the
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
tram was coming the the life expectancy
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
of the tram was coming to an end soon um
 
04:16:45.870 --> 04:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
so we started this conversation three or
 
04:16:47.790 --> 04:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
four years ago through the capital
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
budget process um we explored arpa um
 
04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
that didn't pan out um we were allocated
 
04:17:00.670 --> 04:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
188 million um in the last budget for
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
the tram and that was okay for us
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
because we are all of our estimates at
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
the at the time we did estimates um
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
predicted about a 20 to $25 million
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
ticket for the whole thing the P shebang
 
04:17:17.469 --> 04:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
so 18 million from the the state
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
allocation we could Bridge the rest we
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
could figure out how to get to the rest
 
04:17:24.670 --> 04:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
when we did go out to bid um the one bid
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
that came back was a total of 33 million
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
so we can't do 18 to we we're just not
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
in a position to bridge that so we're
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
revisiting um options we have a couple
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
of of I of ideas and some strategies
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
that we're working through with um
 
04:17:43.870 --> 04:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner Charlie Arling house and
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
his team at DPW uh right now the tram is
 
04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated regularly it is safe for
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
operation um we're looking forward to a
 
04:17:56.670 --> 04:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful Fall Foliage season um but we
 
04:17:59.550 --> 04:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
do recognize that um pretty soon we're
 
04:18:01.830 --> 04:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
going to have a component that's
 
04:18:04.630 --> 04:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
Irreplaceable because of its age um and
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
so we need to come up with a a plan
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later it's a top
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
priority of ours thank
 
04:18:15.670 --> 04:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
you thanks Senator Ros thank you so
 
04:18:19.990 --> 04:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
Canon mountain is skiing in the winter
 
04:18:22.550 --> 04:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the tram in this summer and
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
everything else is state is Franconia
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
state park Canon mountain is part of
 
04:18:30.429 --> 04:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
Franconia not state park right
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
but I I guess I'm wondering why in the
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement
 
04:18:36.399 --> 04:18:38.429 align:start position:0%
capital Improvement
fund

04:18:38.429 --> 04:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
um some of the money not all of the
 
04:18:42.439 --> 04:18:43.670 align:start position:0%
um some of the money not all of the
money

04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%
is going to the Canon Mountain ski area
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
and trm some of it is going apparently
 
04:18:52.880 --> 04:18:54.469 align:start position:0%
and trm some of it is going apparently
to

04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:18:57.630 --> 04:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
Franconia State Park and you know where
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
I'm coming from on this which is the
 
04:19:07.870 --> 04:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
continuing higher skiing fees on the
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
military and
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
seniors and so I'm just wondering why
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're not spending all of the Canon
 
04:19:21.109 --> 04:19:21.119 align:start position:0%
Mountain Capital Improvement fund on
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
either the ski area or the
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
Tramway but some is apparently going to
 
04:19:31.950 --> 04:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
Fran coni and not State Park um no so we
 
04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
we are spending everything that is
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
available at Canon so maybe maybe it
 
04:19:40.109 --> 04:19:40.119 align:start position:0%
would be better said this way Franconia
 
04:19:43.870 --> 04:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
Notch State Park resides on Canon
 
04:19:46.590 --> 04:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
Mountain on Canon Mountain during the
 
04:19:49.710 --> 04:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
winter we have ski operations on Canon
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
mountain and during the summer the park
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
is the primary function on that mountain
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
the Tramway also exists on Canon
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
mountain and that functions primarily in
 
04:20:03.510 --> 04:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
the summer it does not typically
 
04:20:05.189 --> 04:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
function for any kind of Revenue
 
04:20:07.429 --> 04:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
generating purposes in the
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
winter all of the money being used
 
04:20:13.309 --> 04:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
through this bonding opportunity that
 
04:20:17.070 --> 04:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
exists is devoted to infrastructure that
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
resides on Canon
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
mountain now it could be for winter
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
operational needs so you know snow
 
04:20:25.520 --> 04:20:27.309 align:start position:0%
operational needs so you know snow
makings

04:20:27.309 --> 04:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
makings
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
pumps various types of
 
04:20:33.109 --> 04:20:33.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it could also be used for
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
other infrastructure that may be used
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
during summertime um
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
the the statute itself is descri it
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
instructs the revolving fund shall be
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
used for Capital Improvements for the
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
ski area and related State Park
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
facilities at counton
 
04:20:54.269 --> 04:20:54.279 align:start position:0%
Mountain so it can be done for
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
both um which is typically P most of the
 
04:21:00.590 --> 04:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
time it's been it's been used for the
 
04:21:03.389 --> 04:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
winter operations that is where a lot of
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure spending needs need
 
04:21:07.990 --> 04:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
to occur up on that mountain I can't
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
think of a single project that um that
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
we've there or that um Canon Mountain
 
04:21:15.109 --> 04:21:15.119 align:start position:0%
advisory commission has authorized for
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
that that is outside of the footprint of
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
the Canon Mountain ski area um we don't
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
do anything you know down the road at
 
04:21:23.269 --> 04:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
The Flume or the the campground or
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
anything it's really strictly for snow
 
04:21:28.030 --> 04:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
making lift maintenance the Tramway the
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
physical buildings that are part of the
 
04:21:31.510 --> 04:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
footprint of the ski area like The
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
Lodges or the ski school facility um and
 
04:21:36.950 --> 04:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
other supporting infrastructure really
 
04:21:38.590 --> 04:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
within the footprint of the ski area but
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
not not to the greater Franconia not
 
04:21:43.149 --> 04:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
State Park
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
yes thanks I appreciate that but it
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
seems like the statute would allow you
 
04:21:50.910 --> 04:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:21:56.670 --> 04:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
that and maybe we should look at that so
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have to
 
04:22:03.710 --> 04:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
keep raising skiing fees on seniors by
 
04:22:09.149 --> 04:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
20 plus perc every year um well so the
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
our our fees are really separate from
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
the capital Improvement Fund in in the
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
sense that there that th those are
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
strictly being um part of of our
 
04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
operating funds to cover our operating
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
costs which is a separate Bud budget now
 
04:22:23.429 --> 04:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
you could make the argument that the
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
more that we let something go and and
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't put it into our operating budget
 
04:22:29.109 --> 04:22:29.119 align:start position:0%
as far as like preventative maintenance
 
04:22:30.950 --> 04:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
or something then that becomes a a
 
04:22:34.750 --> 04:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
capital item certainly um um so I I I
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
see your point there relative to the
 
04:22:38.830 --> 04:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
that extra couple of words there within
 
04:22:41.309 --> 04:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
the statue saying in other Park related
 
04:22:43.830 --> 04:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um so that that that
 
04:22:48.670 --> 04:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
could be contemplated but I I can um our
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
position has been that that is really
 
04:22:54.670 --> 04:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
completely isolated to this to uh the
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
components of the ski area um and other
 
04:23:00.149 --> 04:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
functions and infrastructure needs that
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
we have throughout greater francon not
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
State Park we would put through a
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
request other
 
04:23:09.279 --> 04:23:10.990 align:start position:0%
request other
question

04:23:10.990 --> 04:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:23:12.960 --> 04:23:15.070 align:start position:0%
okay all right
good

04:23:15.070 --> 04:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
um now does it really make sense to be
 
04:23:20.830 --> 04:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
in continuous debt
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
here because you're saying that you
 
04:23:23.359 --> 04:23:24.389 align:start position:0%
here because you're saying that you
can't

04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
borrow um as much as you're paying in
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
right you're always paying interest
 
04:23:30.399 --> 04:23:32.309 align:start position:0%
right you're always paying interest
so

04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
um if you're just sitting on this 18
 
04:23:38.910 --> 04:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
million allocated for this use could we
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
could we pay this off and and gain some
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
interest right now that we're not going
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
to pay uh well first I just want to make
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
sure we're clear the 18 million you're
 
04:23:52.030 --> 04:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
referring to that's for the tram for the
 
04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
tram that was allocated through the
 
04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
budget process specifically for the uh
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of investing in the in the tram
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
refurbishment The Six Million I'm sorry
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
the the $6 million that is bonded um yes
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
if there was if there was no debt on
 
04:24:10.269 --> 04:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
that Bond and that $6 million was
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
available that could be used to support
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
support that project that is true is is
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
that what you're right so my question is
 
04:24:19.389 --> 04:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
well maybe the other way to think about
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
it is is the interest we're getting on
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
this 18 million greater or less than
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
than the interest we're paying on the 6
 
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
million in
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
debt do we
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
know the 18 million if it was in the
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
capital budget would be borrowed when
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
the when the project was started oh was
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
it capital budget money yeah yeah
 
04:24:41.469 --> 04:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
correct so it's oh it's not yet it's not
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
yet borrowed it's not sitting there okay
 
04:24:46.830 --> 04:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I thought you meant that
 
04:24:48.590 --> 04:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
18 million was allocated out of the
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget but only until it was
 
04:24:53.950 --> 04:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
needed and then they would Bond it right
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
so it's in House Bill 25 right yes uh
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually this particular funding was in
 
04:25:01.710 --> 04:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
house bill to it was in the trailer bill
 
04:25:04.109 --> 04:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
it was not specified but it was intended
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
capital so it wasn't borrowed it has not
 
04:25:10.189 --> 04:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
yet been borrowed no it has only been
 
04:25:10.199 --> 04:25:12.510 align:start position:0%
yet been borrowed no it has only been
appropriated

04:25:12.510 --> 04:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
it will be borrowed if we can ultimately
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
Bor in house B operating County units
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
Sor it's the Appropriations in one of
 
04:25:22.429 --> 04:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
your operating it is in one of our
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
operating account so it's sitting in
 
04:25:24.910 --> 04:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
pulled cash right now under the
 
04:25:27.269 --> 04:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
treasurer's cash accounts right sorry
 
04:25:28.950 --> 04:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
yes they do have it in
 
04:25:31.950 --> 04:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
cash yeah they got General funds the
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
point right yeah yeah so it has it it's
 
04:25:37.550 --> 04:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
not really typical capital budget
 
04:25:39.429 --> 04:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
dollars if it's coming from a house bill
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
to appropriation it's likely General
 
04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
correct so yes I I stand correct on that
 
04:25:47.790 --> 04:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
that it was allocated under an operating
 
04:25:49.710 --> 04:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
budget account it was not allocated
 
04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
specific to the capital budget itself
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay right it's just for
 
04:25:56.510 --> 04:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
a capital in nature type of item but
 
04:25:58.830 --> 04:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's right not capital budget funding
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
so yeah sitting in a bank account
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
earning interest with all of our other
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
state funds it is not isolated so we
 
04:26:07.149 --> 04:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to tell you you know
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
exactly what saying was capital budget
 
04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
we don't right we don't spend it till we
 
04:26:15.109 --> 04:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
need correct then we borrow it on a when
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
I talk to the state treasurer I'll ask
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
that question of her all right thank you
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
all right let's go
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
on what's next here well I think we're
 
04:26:28.030 --> 04:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
going backwards we're going backwards
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah because we skipped the conservation
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
plate fund I
 
04:26:37.710 --> 04:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
believe and then well should we go
 
04:26:42.309 --> 04:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
forwards to to more um State Park type
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah yeah is there you're the only
 
04:26:48.870 --> 04:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
one who knows what state park stuff
 
04:26:52.790 --> 04:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
is wow parking facilities you guys can
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
go in any order you want we'll keep up
 
04:26:58.030 --> 04:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
okay parking facilities at Hampton
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
Beach yeah
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
105 Hampton
 
04:27:08.429 --> 04:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
meters yeah okay page 14 in the hand up
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah that is a park thing okay
 
04:27:21.389 --> 04:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.790 --> 04:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
spaces and so this is basically a source
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
of Revenue yes yes for most of the other
 
04:27:30.030 --> 04:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
state it's a source of Revenue and it's
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
also um set up as a um bonding payback
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism as well too for the uh the
 
04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
seaw wall uh along Ocean Boulevard at
 
04:27:43.710 --> 04:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
North Beach um so um there there we
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's um been bonding projects for
 
04:27:48.830 --> 04:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
that in the past where out of this fund
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh $200,000 goes comes out uh each year
 
04:27:54.269 --> 04:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
to pay down uh the balance on that Bond
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
and then the re remaining funds would
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
cover cost of the operating expenditures
 
04:28:01.750 --> 04:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
relative to our parking Enterprise uh
 
04:28:05.149 --> 04:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the Sea Coast um I think it's
 
04:28:07.030 --> 04:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
worthwhile noting as well to that this
 
04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
operation although it's um or no
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
actually I'm going to confuse things
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
here now because it's it although we
 
04:28:14.830 --> 04:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
have parking meters at other parks along
 
04:28:17.109 --> 04:28:17.119 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast this fund is specific to
 
04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
Park there also a pavilion there that's
 
04:28:23.840 --> 04:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
Park there also a pavilion there that's
paid

04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:29.309 --> 04:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
for um
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
that the well the sea shell complex I
 
04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know Chris that any of the
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
um capital projects of the the Hampton
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment that is not part of the
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
bonding that that this is It's
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
specifically to the seaw wall I believe
 
04:28:47.189 --> 04:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
is that yes so the the amount and again
 
04:28:49.630 --> 04:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
we have a situation where for example a
 
04:28:51.550 --> 04:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
fund uh ID
 
04:28:55.710 --> 04:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
286 which is on page 27 of the handout
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
uh it's called the Hampton Beach Capital
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
Improvement fund within this fund was
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
created I believe around 2012 it was
 
04:29:06.389 --> 04:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
created to manage The Debt Service
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
primarily what on what was ultimately
 
04:29:11.309 --> 04:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
bonded and expended for the seawall
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
effort there is a residual Debt Service
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
that still exists in there although it
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
has waned over the years it's getting
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
smaller and smaller
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
however by Statute requirement Hampton
 
04:29:26.309 --> 04:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
meters continues to contribute $200,000
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
a year directly out of its Revenue
 
04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
earnings to fund the debt service within
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
the Hampton Beach Capital Improvement
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
fund because that amount is far
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
exceeding the amount of actual Debt
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
Service incurred on a yearly basis
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
within that Capital Improvement fund
 
04:29:43.910 --> 04:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
the capital Improvement fund has
 
04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
actually built a
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
balance um over the last few years and
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh in 20123 we actually used a
 
04:29:56.030 --> 04:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of that uh close to
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
$300,000 to fund uh some Capital
 
04:30:02.389 --> 04:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
Improvements that Brian could elaborate
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
I don't remember specifically what it
 
04:30:05.389 --> 04:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
was um most of the things that were're
 
04:30:07.189 --> 04:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
funding on Capital Improvements uh
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
relative at Hampton right now are storm
 
04:30:13.189 --> 04:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
damage respon response so um that that
 
04:30:16.349 --> 04:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
is a challenge to keep Pace
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
with so so Hampton meters does support
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
the capital Improvement fund that was
 
04:30:25.630 --> 04:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
created for for Hampton Beach uh in a in
 
04:30:28.109 --> 04:30:28.119 align:start position:0%
a fairly substantial way right
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
now so are you saying the 200,000 should
 
04:30:34.109 --> 04:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
be adjusted to something else something
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
smaller no um no I'm just merely
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
pointing out that it exceeds the amount
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
of debt service that is still being paid
 
04:30:44.189 --> 04:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
on the remaining amount of what was
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
bonded okay but but it doesn't but you
 
04:30:49.630 --> 04:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
also have these other
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
expenses for for Capital
 
04:30:57.070 --> 04:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
Improvement right I mean if you have to
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
patch uh potholes
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
or fixed parking meters or something
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
like that right yeah as as as expenses
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
come along particularly in this case as
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
Brian pointed out you know there's been
 
04:31:13.469 --> 04:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
significant storm damage issues that
 
04:31:15.710 --> 04:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
have occurred over the last few years it
 
04:31:17.710 --> 04:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
has actually been a good thing to the
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
extent that by building up a balance
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
within this Hampton Beach Capital
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
Improvement fund by putting $200,000 a
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
year over there um against a Debt
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
Service that much less than that we were
 
04:31:31.630 --> 04:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
able to leverage that builtup balance to
 
04:31:31.640 --> 04:31:32.590 align:start position:0%
able to leverage that builtup balance to
actually

04:31:32.590 --> 04:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
fund some some Capital infrastructure
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
needs that needed to occur on the on the
 
04:31:39.710 --> 04:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast and not have delays on fixing
 
04:31:42.030 --> 04:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
the damage
 
04:31:43.590 --> 04:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
yes there is an advantage to being able
 
04:31:44.670 --> 04:31:44.680 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
04:31:51.070 --> 04:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
um and um go ahead are you going to have
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
to extend the seaw wall because that
 
04:31:57.149 --> 04:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
that those storms are going to keep
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
coming I defer that question to director
 
04:32:06.429 --> 04:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
Wilson um maybe not in our lifetimes uh
 
04:32:09.309 --> 04:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
but uh perhaps someday yes we we we
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
every year we seem to have uh greater
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
impacts newer impacts we're working very
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
closely with the Department of
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation they have within their
 
04:32:21.229 --> 04:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
10-year Transportation plan a major
 
04:32:24.269 --> 04:32:24.279 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment of Ocean Boulevard um and
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
we're really working closely with that
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
because it it all com contemplates
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
realignment of the roadway in
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the sidewalks and the
 
04:32:34.109 --> 04:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
seaw wall and as you all know it's we
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
have a very narrow Corridor uh there to
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
be able to work with um and um you know
 
04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just the ocean side of the
 
04:32:44.349 --> 04:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
things but we have the marsh uh to the
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
West as well too which is all part of
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
the same uh system that uh you know
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
continues to um congest on on everything
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
there so that's going to be uh a
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
state all right so um don't expect the
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
200,000 away yeah so the what you're
 
04:33:08.349 --> 04:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
talking about this annual Debt Service
 
04:33:13.070 --> 04:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:15.750 --> 04:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
roughly I guess uh if you're referring
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
to the uh the table under 286 yes yeah
 
04:33:25.269 --> 04:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
on page 28 on page 28 yes so The Debt
 
04:33:28.629 --> 04:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
Service uh is is you can see it's it's
 
04:33:31.269 --> 04:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
slowly incrementally decreasing every
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
year but yes it's in the $880,000 a year
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
range it went it's actually down to 73
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we expect that to continue to Trend
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
until that debt service is paid which
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
means the $200,000 going into this
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
account will just acrew as available
 
04:33:48.750 --> 04:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
funding uh to support Capital
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
Improvements now do you have a more
 
04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
General Capital fund for all
 
04:33:59.709 --> 04:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
parks nothing more than the normal
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
capital budget that
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
we seek to to to have oh so you go to
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
how Bill 25 25 yes right that's correct
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
I see gotcha
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
that if you had less here you could have
 
04:34:20.561 --> 04:34:21.949 align:start position:0%
that if you had less here you could have
more

04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:34:28.590 --> 04:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah I suppose it's I guess
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
you could look at it two different ways
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems as though the need in
 
04:34:41.070 --> 04:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
both areas is is great um so I'm not
 
04:34:43.869 --> 04:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
sure if if I could qualify advantage or
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
disadvantage either way I would again
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
defer to to director Wilson on that are
 
04:34:50.551 --> 04:34:50.561 align:start position:0%
you are suggesting that if the the
 
04:34:53.429 --> 04:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
200,000 was 150 was
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
150,000 that that extra would go back
 
04:34:58.709 --> 04:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
into uh Park fund or our operating
 
04:35:04.990 --> 04:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
budget U so to speak um yes um but um
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
the mechanism how it's currently sent
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
works for us as you know just as well I
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
think um because there are you know
 
04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
Beach is one of our Flagship parks and
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
infrastructure needs there I think
 
04:35:20.109 --> 04:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
structurally how this was set up um
 
04:35:22.349 --> 04:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
helps us um kind of be able to be a
 
04:35:23.949 --> 04:35:23.959 align:start position:0%
little bit more Nimble with that capital
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
account to specifically address um
 
04:35:29.150 --> 04:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
capital projects now they are always
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
going to be smaller in nature of only
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
just a few hundred thousand doll at a
 
04:35:34.990 --> 04:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
time probably unless we somehow were
 
04:35:36.670 --> 04:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
able to go over a long period of time
 
04:35:39.269 --> 04:35:39.279 align:start position:0%
without having to access that at all um
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
but our Park revenue and the revenue
 
04:35:42.990 --> 04:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
stream are never going to be able to
 
04:35:46.269 --> 04:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
keep Pace with the um both our operating
 
04:35:49.949 --> 04:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
expenses and our and the capital needs
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
okay all right so let's say we're done
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
with whatever this one
 
04:35:58.750 --> 04:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
is other
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right so this is um there
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
were two Hampton Beach things 286 right
 
04:36:11.789 --> 04:36:11.799 align:start position:0%
okay so we finished 286 fin 286 that
 
04:36:11.799 --> 04:36:13.070 align:start position:0%
okay so we finished 286 fin 286 that
one's

04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
one's
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
287 why isn't two wait
 
04:36:22.269 --> 04:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
a yeah 286 is uh Capital Improvements
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
and equipment for half so why isn't it
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it's in the spreadsheet
 
04:36:27.119 --> 04:36:28.429 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet it's in the spreadsheet
under

04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:36:39.629 --> 04:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:44.439 --> 04:36:47.429 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
right oh okay sorry page 13 at the
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
bottom all right oh she her print out
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
was different than mind sorry better
 
04:37:03.150 --> 04:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
order yeah well that would require
 
04:37:06.269 --> 04:37:06.279 align:start position:0%
rewriting the dedicated funds yeah let's
 
04:37:09.429 --> 04:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
make a committee to do the and I already
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
done that once all right
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
so went from all right where we were on
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
the parking meters all right so this was
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
number page 14 yeah number 104 go back
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
before there's one more Hampton beach3
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:51.349 --> 04:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
plan okay GI and
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
is all right it's page 25 of
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
36 and it's page 13 of this one gifts
 
04:38:11.840 --> 04:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
36 and it's page 13 of this one gifts
and

04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:22.109 --> 04:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
fund this the town of Hampton and the
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
state of with the state of New Hampshire
 
04:38:32.349 --> 04:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
it's collaborative okay gr Emer I think
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
called me about this one make sure it
 
04:38:34.160 --> 04:38:35.789 align:start position:0%
called me about this one make sure it
gets

04:38:35.789 --> 04:38:35.799 align:start position:0%
gets
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
fun all right yes um the Hampton each
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
area commission um does great work it is
 
04:38:45.429 --> 04:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
it is a very uh important collaborative
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
group with stakeholders including Dot
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
and dncr uh and the town of Hampton
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
among others um um that um has worked um
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
to do the Hampton Beach master plan
 
04:38:59.310 --> 04:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
which was really kind of the first phase
 
04:39:02.029 --> 04:39:02.039 align:start position:0%
to um bring the realization of the
 
04:39:03.789 --> 04:39:03.799 align:start position:0%
Redevelopment project that is Hampton
 
04:39:07.109 --> 04:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
Beach State Park now um which um is you
 
04:39:09.310 --> 04:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
know was a catalyst for um you know
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of millions of
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
dollars of economic impact and and
 
04:39:16.029 --> 04:39:16.039 align:start position:0%
development in in the C Coast Community
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
um and they continue to do work now
 
04:39:19.869 --> 04:39:19.879 align:start position:0%
they've they've um started you know
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
they're collectively working on other
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
resiliency plans um both you know that
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
the town of Hampton locally is doing um
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
but also bringing back to you know
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%
collaborate with uh the state agencies
 
04:39:34.109 --> 04:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
mainly do and um
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
dncr um and um as you can see here their
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
their sources of funding are starting to
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
to to dry up here but um so that I I I I
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
believe that they'll be looking for some
 
04:39:47.910 --> 04:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
additional appropriation uh at some
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
point so they can continue to do their
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
work and um our agency serves as sort of
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
a um an oversight to the administrative
 
04:40:01.948 --> 04:40:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.708 --> 04:40:03.718 align:start position:0%
um all
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
right so this one
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
um all right so where did they get the
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
year yeah I can speak to that so this
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
was uh this was related to uh money that
 
04:40:28.830 --> 04:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
was allocated again uh through
 
04:40:31.628 --> 04:40:31.638 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh it was made available for the
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of conducting a feasibility
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
study um which the money passed through
 
04:40:41.948 --> 04:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry was it the accessibility
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah one was there was an accessibility
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
and then a feasibility yes that's
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
correct so both the $20,000 figure and
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
the $150,000 figure were passed through
 
04:40:57.070 --> 04:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh the budget process and I believe
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's a report due at the end of
 
04:41:01.590 --> 04:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
October right Brian yes they're they're
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh currently um working with us on the
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
facilitation of the um accessibility
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
study which was um the result of uh uh
 
04:41:10.840 --> 04:41:12.390 align:start position:0%
study which was um the result of uh uh
legis

04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
legis
 
04:41:16.948 --> 04:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
last last year um relative to the um
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussion about the um construction of
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
a pier at Hampton Beach um so that that
 
04:41:23.628 --> 04:41:23.638 align:start position:0%
ended up turning into an accessibility
 
04:41:25.868 --> 04:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
study which is um nearing the end of
 
04:41:25.878 --> 04:41:26.830 align:start position:0%
study which is um nearing the end of
their

04:41:26.830 --> 04:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:41:29.070 --> 04:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
work so if we're just going to put stuff
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
fund well this this money was through us
 
04:41:41.788 --> 04:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
to this Commission
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
if I understand
 
04:41:47.948 --> 04:41:47.958 align:start position:0%
correctly yeah correct the the
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental purpose of the dedicated
 
04:41:52.590 --> 04:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
fund was support through the Hampton
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
Beach master plan efforts that as I
 
04:41:56.670 --> 04:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
understand are typically ongoing at any
 
04:41:58.948 --> 04:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
given point in time um this was just
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
used it was a mechanism that was
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
available for them
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
to put the funding in so they could
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
perform these particular one-off actions
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry Senator Ros well I
 
04:42:25.030 --> 04:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
following up on your question we
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
frequently make Appropriations to
 
04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
departments that are pass through why do
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
we need a dedicated fund for the
 
04:42:37.708 --> 04:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
feasibility study that's already been
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
done and an accessibility study that's
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
just about
 
04:42:45.868 --> 04:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
done why is the department recommending
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
that we keep this
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
fund again just to to if I could clarify
 
04:42:56.150 --> 04:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
this the receipt of those two amounts
 
04:42:57.868 --> 04:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
that were allocated through the budget
 
04:43:00.270 --> 04:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
process the $20,000 for feasibility and
 
04:43:02.190 --> 04:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
the $150,000 for
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
accessibility those could also just as
 
04:43:05.948 --> 04:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
easily have been allocated to their own
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
accounting units they would have been
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
created as an accounting unit they would
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
have been expended they would have been
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
gone so you wouldn't even have seen them
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
pass through this dedicated fund so
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
assuming let's assume that were the case
 
04:43:19.868 --> 04:43:19.878 align:start position:0%
there's still this dedicated fund which
 
04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
supports the Hampton Beach master plan
 
04:43:25.310 --> 04:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
effort the reason why this fund should
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
continue is because as long as there is
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
a Hampton Beach master plan effort going
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
on and an opportunity to fund that those
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
efforts this dedicated fund will
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
continue to serve its purpose as it was
 
04:43:42.230 --> 04:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
intended does that make
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
sense well it does except there's
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
$197 in it which yes they they were very
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
vigorous in their spending in the last
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
fiscal year but uh that that doesn't
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
mean that there won't be new money and
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
new donations new Revenue put into the
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
account that ultimately will continue to
 
04:44:01.948 --> 04:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
be used for its intended purpose you can
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
thank Nancy styles for that 9197 she
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
likes to make sure that that commission
 
04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
has work to do and that there's
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
Consultants on hand uh to keep them
 
04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
all working towards the work the great
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:22.948 --> 04:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
doing but why is
 
04:44:27.310 --> 04:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach the it's not even a
 
04:44:30.670 --> 04:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
municipality on the only recipient of
 
04:44:33.868 --> 04:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
help with their master
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
plan because it's somewhat of a state
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
park they have more traffic than any
 
04:44:41.070 --> 04:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
place else town and it's a state park
 
04:44:43.390 --> 04:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
fire I started to go there once and 2
 
04:44:45.628 --> 04:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
and a half miles away the traffic was
 
04:44:48.270 --> 04:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
crawling I turned
 
04:44:51.628 --> 04:44:51.638 align:start position:0%
around if it if it helps we ultimately
 
04:44:53.470 --> 04:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
we're really considered a Fiscal Agent
 
04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
under these
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
circumstances we're not really
 
04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
facilitating the purpose of of the plan
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
223 all right so that's it for Hampton
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:24.670 --> 04:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
Parts well we still have probably a
 
04:45:24.680 --> 04:45:25.990 align:start position:0%
Parts well we still have probably a
bunch

04:45:25.990 --> 04:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
bunch
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.320 --> 04:45:34.788 align:start position:0%
 
309

04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.550 --> 04:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
20 29
 
04:45:41.440 --> 04:45:43.868 align:start position:0%
20 29
of

04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.788 --> 04:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
36 at the
 
04:45:56.590 --> 04:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.270 --> 04:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
donation nobody's giving us
 
04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
spending Chris I don't know if I can
 
04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
defer to you on this one one that uh a
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
little less familiar with the
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
utilization of the history here yes so
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
as you can see the the state park gifts
 
04:46:21.550 --> 04:46:21.560 align:start position:0%
and donations account was established
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
some time ago obviously to receive gifts
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
and donations from
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
patrons um in the years in recent years
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
um there is there does continue to be a
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
gift and donation effort that is ongoing
 
04:46:39.628 --> 04:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
for the park system however it appears
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
that the way that we set that up is it's
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
part of the overall uh opport it's part
 
04:46:51.628 --> 04:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
of it's set up for patrons non-patrons
 
04:46:53.910 --> 04:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who wishes to donate to the park
 
04:46:55.230 --> 04:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
can donate
 
04:46:58.150 --> 04:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
directly to the to the state parks
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
account so in doing so the mechanisms
 
04:47:04.110 --> 04:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
for example online donation giving when
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
they choose to donate uh those money are
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
are funnel into the state park account
 
04:47:12.548 --> 04:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
directly so so this account has been
 
04:47:16.670 --> 04:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
retained for the purpose of donations
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
that are brought to us separately
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
typically for a specific purpose uh
 
04:47:24.270 --> 04:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
something that somebody wishes to
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
identify and thus donate for so we
 
04:47:29.910 --> 04:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a lot of that activity or
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
we have not used this account for that
 
04:47:35.948 --> 04:47:35.958 align:start position:0%
activity in some time um I don't know if
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
discussed internally as far as whether
 
04:47:41.708 --> 04:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
we should be leveraging ing the purpose
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
of this this account uh to
 
04:47:48.788 --> 04:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
clarify when what types of donations
 
04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
would go into this account versus the
 
04:47:52.270 --> 04:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
receipt of donations that we're
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
receiving directly from folks that go on
 
04:47:57.868 --> 04:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
for example buy you know admissions
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
tickets or make Park camp reservations
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
and at the same time say yeah plus I
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
want to give $25 to the park so it all
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
just gets put in as part of their fees
 
04:48:09.470 --> 04:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
it goes directly into the state park
 
04:48:11.230 --> 04:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
account and we don't see it flow through
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
this donation
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
account is there uh limits on how much
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
those kind of donations can be there are
 
04:48:22.750 --> 04:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
no limits per se uh but any donation
 
04:48:22.760 --> 04:48:23.548 align:start position:0%
no limits per se uh but any donation
over

04:48:23.548 --> 04:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:48:25.788 --> 04:48:25.798 align:start position:0%
$2,500 also needs to be approved through
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
the governor Council
 
04:48:30.190 --> 04:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
process but that would be true in either
 
04:48:34.350 --> 04:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
case yes right so
 
04:48:36.990 --> 04:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
maybe uh this isn't needed and we can
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
just put the balance into the other
 
04:48:41.948 --> 04:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
account into this directly into the
 
04:48:44.110 --> 04:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
state ski account so it certainly would
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
be possible I'd defer director Wilson if
 
04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
he has an opinion about that one way or
 
04:48:47.400 --> 04:48:49.628 align:start position:0%
he has an opinion about that one way or
the

04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:49.638 --> 04:48:52.510 align:start position:0%
 
other

04:48:52.510 --> 04:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:48:58.150 --> 04:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
um I I I think that that seems like
 
04:49:02.110 --> 04:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
relatively um benign action I don't
 
04:49:04.110 --> 04:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
think that that would have any big
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
impact yeah this is I will say this is
 
04:49:08.670 --> 04:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively old this is an old
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
account I think this was created created
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
at a time when donations primarily were
 
04:49:18.110 --> 04:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
people writing checks giving
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
cash um and now of course you know
 
04:49:24.190 --> 04:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
modern technology donations can be made
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
very easily very quickly and typically
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
cash and checks are just not seen so uh
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
there may be it may make sense at this
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
point to consider um eliminating this I
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
I had a political event and I had a
 
04:49:40.830 --> 04:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
friend who wanted to go and I and he
 
04:49:43.110 --> 04:49:43.120 align:start position:0%
says how do I make a donation and I said
 
04:49:44.910 --> 04:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
well just bring a check and he says I
 
04:49:46.548 --> 04:49:46.558 align:start position:0%
haven't written a check in three years
 
04:49:49.230 --> 04:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
like all right yes um representative M
 
04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
me so if you um if we deleted this fund
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:06.920 --> 04:50:08.788 align:start position:0%
 
account

04:50:08.788 --> 04:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:50:11.030 --> 04:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
33 yes it would it would go in into the
 
04:50:13.070 --> 04:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
into the park account it go into the
 
04:50:16.270 --> 04:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
3702 is the actual account that
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.708 --> 04:50:26.718 align:start position:0%
balance 37 point over here yeah just
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
real quick it may have been set up
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
because often donations uh come with a
 
04:50:33.628 --> 04:50:33.638 align:start position:0%
deed of gift and they may have done that
 
04:50:36.190 --> 04:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
for tracking purposes so let's say
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
somebody gave a gift to fix the Hampton
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
Beach you know
 
04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
wall or something um I'm sure that the
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
trust division would want to know that
 
04:50:50.910 --> 04:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:53.230 --> 04:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
purpose uh thank you yes that would be
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
another good example of why you would
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
maintain a separate account I'd be
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
curious um and I guess again this might
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
require just internal discussion I I
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
haven't seen anything like that and I've
 
04:51:05.590 --> 04:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
been here 10 years so I I I'm not sure
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
apparently in 2021 2022 somebody gave
 
04:51:09.600 --> 04:51:11.070 align:start position:0%
apparently in 2021 2022 somebody gave
$15,000

04:51:11.070 --> 04:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
$15,000
 
04:51:15.350 --> 04:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
for a specific thing yeah yeah m a money
 
04:51:15.360 --> 04:51:16.868 align:start position:0%
for a specific thing yeah yeah m a money
donation

04:51:16.868 --> 04:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
donation
 
04:51:20.548 --> 04:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
yeah well you you spent
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
$115,000 and then you raised
 
04:51:27.750 --> 04:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
15,000 so so that was a specific item it
 
04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
looks like it likely but I would have to
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
go back and look specifically what that
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
was I'm not that have been
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
Trails before my time so I have to I can
 
04:51:40.110 --> 04:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
I can get the history on that for you
 
04:51:42.788 --> 04:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
that so so maybe we keep the account but
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
move the
 
04:51:47.190 --> 04:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
money it's possible yeah sure
 
04:51:51.548 --> 04:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
okay um yes representative Jenny again
 
04:51:55.230 --> 04:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
um so if this account goes away and
 
04:51:56.830 --> 04:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to make a donation where
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
would it go uh so I can speak to that I
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking that question
 
04:52:03.510 --> 04:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
because I was going to make a point that
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
although you're not seeing any activity
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
here we actually are seeing quite a bit
 
04:52:10.070 --> 04:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
of generosity out in in the park system
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh Within the last um uh couple of years
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
we've um um stood up um multiple
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
different ways of making donations you
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
can go on our website there's a button
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
right there that says make a donation um
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
and so you can go through um our online
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
portal this the same system for our
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
Campground and dayuse reservation
 
04:52:30.628 --> 04:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
systems will collect that um
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
additionally at many of our uh Park
 
04:52:35.230 --> 04:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
areas particularly the ones where we
 
04:52:38.270 --> 04:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't charge a fee um we are um if you
 
04:52:40.750 --> 04:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
recall kind of the Old Iron Ranger Green
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
things where you would stick your money
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
in the slot we've been converting those
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
to more advanced mechanisms with QR
 
04:52:49.390 --> 04:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
codes and other things and within the
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
last year um we're generating over
 
04:52:56.310 --> 04:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 um in online donations um and
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
and donations from the field so we're
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that that is being um um
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
utilized and and has been very effective
 
04:53:04.830 --> 04:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
in generating additional re revenue for
 
04:53:07.310 --> 04:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
us and we continue to try to expand that
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
program um particularly our into our
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
Trail Network is where we're really
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
thinking that there's some opportunity
 
04:53:14.510 --> 04:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
there now as well
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
too okay well that that sounds good
 
04:53:18.910 --> 04:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
because if there's other ways to donate
 
04:53:20.830 --> 04:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
and I was going to suggest something on
 
04:53:22.110 --> 04:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
the website which it sounds like you
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
already have then this does in my
 
04:53:26.190 --> 04:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
opinion seem like it's obsolete at this
 
04:53:29.830 --> 04:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
point yeah representative M the only
 
04:53:31.948 --> 04:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
reason I can see for keeping this is the
 
04:53:34.510 --> 04:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
difference between gifts and donations
 
04:53:36.190 --> 04:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
and I never realized there was a
 
04:53:38.830 --> 04:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
difference I thought it was just archaic
 
04:53:41.788 --> 04:53:41.798 align:start position:0%
language on
 
04:53:45.708 --> 04:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
but having this here if anybody looks at
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
those things sends a message that
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
anything yeah okay so therefore we don't
 
04:53:56.160 --> 04:53:57.868 align:start position:0%
anything yeah okay so therefore we don't
want

04:53:57.868 --> 04:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:53:57.878 --> 04:53:59.470 align:start position:0%
want
okay

04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:02.830 --> 04:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
good all right so that's that's good
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
where are um are we at the end of state
 
04:54:07.200 --> 04:54:11.310 align:start position:0%
where are um are we at the end of state
parks

04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
and did we did we Overlook anything in
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
between uh yes uh 108 is U Mount
 
04:54:22.868 --> 04:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
Washington and then there's um a few
 
04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
others beyond that as well too all right
 
04:54:27.390 --> 04:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
let's go to 108 I separated Mount
 
04:54:31.708 --> 04:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
Washington is I think a cluster
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
group that's on page 16 of
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
commission so the uh 108 the Mount
 
04:54:55.590 --> 04:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
Washington commission this is uh sort of
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
a a unique oneoff within the context of
 
04:55:01.868 --> 04:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
the greater Park system where um a
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
individual Park Mount Washington state
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
park has it has under RSA it its own
 
04:55:09.548 --> 04:55:09.558 align:start position:0%
oversight body and its own budgeting uh
 
04:55:12.548 --> 04:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
its own budget mechanism outside of uh
 
04:55:19.070 --> 04:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.548 --> 04:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
account yeah so is this the auto road or
 
04:55:26.350 --> 04:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
is that no it's uh we it's the summit of
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington is the is the state
 
04:55:32.270 --> 04:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
park so uh we work very the um the um
 
04:55:35.070 --> 04:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
members of the auto Road um and the Cog
 
04:55:37.470 --> 04:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
Railway and other Summit Partners like
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh the Appalachian Mountain Club um
 
04:55:44.190 --> 04:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
um um and the the Mount Washington
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
weather observ are are members of the
 
04:55:47.788 --> 04:55:47.798 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington commission so that
 
04:55:50.788 --> 04:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
Collective body meets uh very routinely
 
04:55:54.310 --> 04:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
to um you know work through uh their
 
04:55:55.788 --> 04:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements of kind of the
 
04:55:57.948 --> 04:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
oversight and stewardship of of Mount
 
04:55:59.470 --> 04:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
Washington State
 
04:56:02.310 --> 04:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
Park uh the funding uh oh and that
 
04:56:05.030 --> 04:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
commission has control of this account
 
04:56:05.040 --> 04:56:09.230 align:start position:0%
commission has control of this account
yes

04:56:09.230 --> 04:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay doing that right yeah
 
04:56:16.868 --> 04:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
yeah there is one thing uh the purchase
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth College ended in 2020 so
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
report are you saying Dartmouth owns the
 
04:56:33.788 --> 04:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth owned it which is something
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I was surprised to oh to Dartmouth
 
04:56:39.910 --> 04:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes I see from Dartmouth sold it to us
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
to to us over a long period and that
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
ended in 2020 yeah got and they have a
 
04:56:51.110 --> 04:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
lot of money they probably shouldn't
 
04:56:53.708 --> 04:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
have all right I
 
04:56:55.750 --> 04:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
see all right so you don't see any need
 
04:56:59.830 --> 04:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
for changes in this area yeah anybody oh
 
04:57:02.430 --> 04:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
y Senator is thank
 
04:57:06.390 --> 04:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
you they're not that many people on the
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
commission so I'm curious why the
 
04:57:09.080 --> 04:57:10.750 align:start position:0%
commission so I'm curious why the
expenses

04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
04:57:13.070 --> 04:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
are almost two and a half million
 
04:57:15.708 --> 04:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so the commission is for
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
the uh advisory oversight body to the
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
operation of the summit uh so the summit
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
facilities the Sherman Adams Building uh
 
04:57:25.310 --> 04:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
the communication facilities that are at
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
the summit all of the
 
04:57:30.430 --> 04:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing um uh that goes on there the we
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
have our a wastewater treatment plan at
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
the summit so all of those operations
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
are what the what the operating budget
 
04:57:39.548 --> 04:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh that's where our expenditures lie and
 
04:57:42.190 --> 04:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
then uh um similar to the state parks
 
04:57:44.708 --> 04:57:44.718 align:start position:0%
and Canon Mountain it is set up to be
 
04:57:47.670 --> 04:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
self-funded in nature so um all of the
 
04:57:49.628 --> 04:57:49.638 align:start position:0%
retail operation at the summit that we
 
04:57:52.270 --> 04:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
the state park division manages um
 
04:57:54.670 --> 04:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
concessions food sweatshirts everything
 
04:57:56.390 --> 04:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
that you can imagine at the store at the
 
04:57:58.830 --> 04:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
summer uh at The Summit in addition to
 
04:58:01.548 --> 04:58:01.558 align:start position:0%
leases that come in for uh communication
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
Services uh and also leases with like
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
the weather uh the Mount Washington
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
Observatory uh the auto Road agreements
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
with the Cog all of that Revenue helps
 
04:58:12.910 --> 04:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh offset uh the the the cost to operate
 
04:58:15.390 --> 04:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
and manage the summit so it's not just
 
04:58:17.788 --> 04:58:17.798 align:start position:0%
funding the commission no yes yeah the
 
04:58:20.830 --> 04:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
commissions funding is very very simple
 
04:58:22.708 --> 04:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
you know they they get uh Refreshments
 
04:58:25.110 --> 04:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
at their meetings and um mileage of
 
04:58:26.670 --> 04:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement maybe and that's probably
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
the extent of what the the cost of that
 
04:58:31.708 --> 04:58:31.718 align:start position:0%
group is yeah do they meet at The Summit
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
we are meeting at the summit this Friday
 
04:58:34.830 --> 04:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
actually if you want to come we're going
 
04:58:36.350 --> 04:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
to be in the tiptop house might be a
 
04:58:38.510 --> 04:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
little chilly but uh we generally meet
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
offsite but uh gen once a year they do
 
04:58:43.030 --> 04:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
like to try to get to the summit when
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
when the conditions are allowable so all
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
right but unlike your meeting they
 
04:58:50.030 --> 04:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
apparently have
 
04:58:55.868 --> 04:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
aha all right well um the that's
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
related because tiptop house is also at
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
the summit that's related to a private
 
04:59:06.070 --> 04:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
fund for the tiptop which is 110 right
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
oh no one 567
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
all right so we we've been going um two
 
04:59:17.788 --> 04:59:17.798 align:start position:0%
hours shall we take a a break of uh s
 
04:59:20.270 --> 04:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
minutes or something for Bio break or
 
04:59:22.030 --> 04:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
get a drink or how much longer are we
 
04:59:23.548 --> 04:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:59:27.910 --> 04:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
go I think we're T to L if we're away
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
but I think we've covered a lot of it
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
okay we we'll take a short break but we
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten into libraries and things
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
like that yet and if you're not if you
 
04:59:46.548 --> 04:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.948 --> 04:59:51.958 align:start position:0%
um no I don't think there's anything I
 
04:59:55.150 --> 04:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
need on that so I think you're
 
04:59:58.270 --> 04:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
good you don't have any
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:08.958 --> 05:00:38.910 align:start position:0%
 
do

05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:38.920 --> 05:01:08.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:01:08.910 --> 05:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:08.920 --> 05:01:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:38.840 --> 05:02:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.840 --> 05:02:38.788 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.798 --> 05:03:08.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:08.760 --> 05:03:38.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.718 --> 05:04:08.708 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.718 --> 05:04:38.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:04:38.628 --> 05:04:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:38.638 --> 05:05:08.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:05:08.628 --> 05:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.638 --> 05:05:38.590 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:38.600 --> 05:06:08.548 align:start position:0%
 
e

05:06:08.548 --> 05:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:52.750 --> 05:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
all right let's resume
 
05:06:55.760 --> 05:06:58.990 align:start position:0%
all right let's resume
here

05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.990 --> 05:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think we are on fund
 
05:07:06.788 --> 05:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
number 60 um well you were going to go
 
05:07:09.070 --> 05:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
back to tiptop First oh back to tiptop
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
since we're on Mount Washington yeah
 
05:07:14.590 --> 05:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:14.600 --> 05:07:16.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
tip when yeah fund number
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
167 is that
 
05:07:26.110 --> 05:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
it tiip top
 
05:07:30.310 --> 05:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
house which is 16 which
 
05:07:36.830 --> 05:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
36 all right
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
no expenses no
 
05:07:45.708 --> 05:07:45.718 align:start position:0%
Revenue a little Revenue a tiny amount
 
05:07:49.548 --> 05:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:52.350 --> 05:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
one um okay I'll let Brian talk about it
 
05:07:54.590 --> 05:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
but just a little background um we're
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
currently in um in a in a phase of re
 
05:08:01.548 --> 05:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
freshening up the tiptop house it's such
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
an attraction when you go up to Mount
 
05:08:04.590 --> 05:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
Washington especially if it's a cloudy
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
day and you can't you don't have a view
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's something else to do when you're up
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
at the top um and uh it's an original
 
05:08:14.948 --> 05:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
structure um and so we have invested um
 
05:08:18.190 --> 05:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
some resources uh into sort of um
 
05:08:20.190 --> 05:08:20.200 align:start position:0%
freshening it up rewiring it and
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
creating more of a museum experience in
 
05:08:25.548 --> 05:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
this little building um and so I just
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that I'll let Brian
 
05:08:29.548 --> 05:08:29.558 align:start position:0%
speak to this specific fund but we might
 
05:08:33.270 --> 05:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
be in a position um to spend a little
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
bit of money here and there to to
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
continue our uh reopening efforts at the
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
time right and also it says this is a
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund yes so so we really can't do
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
anything with yeah yeah so the yeah the
 
05:08:48.030 --> 05:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
original um donation to to establish a
 
05:08:50.510 --> 05:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
trust was $20,000 with it and so we
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
can't spend down below that principal
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
amount so as it says our strategy has
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
been to let it uh interest AC crew for a
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
few thousand dollars uh over a course of
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
a few years and then we'll do a project
 
05:09:02.470 --> 05:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
or two there but I also think that
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity here with
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
additional donations as a possibility
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
that once we realize um kind of the
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
revital ization of it and kind of the
 
05:09:13.708 --> 05:09:13.718 align:start position:0%
reopening of it here that we have know a
 
05:09:15.310 --> 05:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism here to hopefully generate
 
05:09:20.190 --> 05:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
some more um philanthropy at the summit
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay very good
 
05:09:28.628 --> 05:09:28.638 align:start position:0%
okay yeah shall we go back to number
 
05:09:31.948 --> 05:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
110 which is number
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
60 well no this is the 110 is snowmobile
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
ohrv and snowmobiles is that par that is
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
under the division of Parks and
 
05:09:44.548 --> 05:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
Recreation yes as well our our Bureau of
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
Trails um
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
um so uh These funds come come by come
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
way by way of um uh registration fees um
 
05:10:00.510 --> 05:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
for uh snowmobiles and uh ohvs um passed
 
05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
through uh the fishing game uh to us uh
 
05:10:06.350 --> 05:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
for the administration of some of our
 
05:10:10.590 --> 05:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
grant and aid programs um so portions of
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
those um those funds go that are
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
collected go back directly out to the
 
05:10:17.708 --> 05:10:17.718 align:start position:0%
clubs and the groups who are uh
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
cooperatively managing those Resources
 
05:10:19.798 --> 05:10:21.270 align:start position:0%
cooperatively managing those Resources
with

05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
us what does unref unded gas tax
 
05:10:28.548 --> 05:10:28.558 align:start position:0%
mean you don't have had to deal with
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
that yet yeah that that's a source of
 
05:10:34.430 --> 05:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
funding that actually comes over uh from
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
from safety uh they we we get a portion
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
I believe we get onethird of the total
 
05:10:41.948 --> 05:10:41.958 align:start position:0%
amount that is collected because it's
 
05:10:45.270 --> 05:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
not used on roads yeah used by off-road
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles so you shouldn't pay the
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
road oh I
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
see well
 
05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's an approximation of how much
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
there is they give it back for bolts
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and Offroad gotcha because
 
05:11:04.110 --> 05:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
they pay the gas tax when they buy their
 
05:11:10.750 --> 05:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
yeah deal with the right Marina they
 
05:11:16.430 --> 05:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
of now um so this one's been gradually
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
growing it looks
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
like are you are you saving for a
 
05:11:30.868 --> 05:11:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.948 --> 05:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
or uh well this is a particular fund
 
05:11:41.070 --> 05:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
that uh is used primar arily a large
 
05:11:44.310 --> 05:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
portion of it is used to fund the grant
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
and aid program but it also does cover
 
05:11:47.868 --> 05:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
all of the administrative costs of
 
05:11:48.990 --> 05:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
running the
 
05:11:49.000 --> 05:11:51.270 align:start position:0%
running the
bureau

05:11:51.270 --> 05:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
05:11:55.030 --> 05:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
um so it has been it has been
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
building uh but again we
 
05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh have certain limits that is to
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
say we are funded by fish and game for a
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money that's all that
 
05:12:10.990 --> 05:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
we're able to receive that's how much is
 
05:12:14.990 --> 05:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
is given out um so if we maintain
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
control of expenses well then the fun
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
the balance does does continue to
 
05:12:23.750 --> 05:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
build I guess I'll just add uh the price
 
05:12:25.708 --> 05:12:25.718 align:start position:0%
of maintaining these Trails has
 
05:12:25.718 --> 05:12:27.310 align:start position:0%
of maintaining these Trails has
increased

05:12:27.310 --> 05:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
increased
 
05:12:30.070 --> 05:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
dramatically I'm learning so much about
 
05:12:34.910 --> 05:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
culverts in this job um and engineering
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
and uh it's not it's not the same as you
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
know the 1980s the so mobile Club could
 
05:12:42.270 --> 05:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
fix a bridge together over you know a
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
weekend uh these these uh storms and the
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
usage really creates expensive projects
 
05:12:49.708 --> 05:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
so it is important for us to have
 
05:12:51.628 --> 05:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how we're spending this
 
05:12:53.868 --> 05:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
the recent storms this past year in
 
05:12:56.350 --> 05:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
several spots in New Hampshire um have
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
created um damage on trails that is that
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
is really um you know upset a lot of
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
people and we're trying our best to
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
prioritize them but it's not it's not as
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
easy and simple as it used to be um also
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
I don't know this is a snapshot so a lot
 
05:13:12.670 --> 05:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
of the funds that come through this
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
account we we go through and we kick
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
back as much as we can to the trail so
 
05:13:19.230 --> 05:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
05:13:21.990 --> 05:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
the we're not usually we're not always
 
05:13:23.350 --> 05:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
sitting it looks like you're getting
 
05:13:25.310 --> 05:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
ready to do a whole bunch of projects
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
this year because you encumbered 4
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
million plus bucks when you previously
 
05:13:32.948 --> 05:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
had only been a million a year I
 
05:13:34.190 --> 05:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
remember one
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
interesting thing that um we were
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
building a bridge and okay doesn't need
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
to be quite as strong as when it had
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
railroad going over it so why why we
 
05:13:47.310 --> 05:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
spending so much well let take care of
 
05:13:49.350 --> 05:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
the cable that runs through the railroad
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
right away but why don't we charge them
 
05:13:54.548 --> 05:13:54.558 align:start position:0%
the cable company the phone company
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
whoever it was well when we bought the
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
right away from the railroad we didn't
 
05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
buy the contract on the right away for
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
the phone
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
company so they the railroad still
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
collects from from the from them for the
 
05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
RightWay but we have to maintain it who
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
put us in that deal I don't know they
 
05:14:18.910 --> 05:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
should be replaced but they're long
 
05:14:18.920 --> 05:14:20.150 align:start position:0%
should be replaced but they're long
[Music]

05:14:20.150 --> 05:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:14:24.230 --> 05:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
gone okay um are you in control of
 
05:14:26.910 --> 05:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
snowmobile registration
 
05:14:30.390 --> 05:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
fees or not no is that statute fishing
 
05:14:33.670 --> 05:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
game fishing game oh fishing game okay I
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
see and they only give you a portion is
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
that right I see okay other questions oh
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
it works it works we're happy okay all
 
05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
right that's
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
110 so now do we want to go back to
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
60 yeah all
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
right all right we'll go back to fund 60
 
05:15:00.230 --> 05:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
05:15:04.590 --> 05:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
345 what's the name is called um
 
05:15:04.600 --> 05:15:06.310 align:start position:0%
345 what's the name is called um
conservation

05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.390 --> 05:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:33.430 --> 05:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
36 so this fund as you as you know um is
 
05:15:36.190 --> 05:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
distributed among several
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
agencies um and this the conservation
 
05:15:43.150 --> 05:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
fund predates the um reall or the
 
05:15:45.868 --> 05:15:45.878 align:start position:0%
reconfiguration of this agency so
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's an allocation to the cultural
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
and there's an allocation um to dncr or
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
to what is now dncr so um there's a long
 
05:16:00.670 --> 05:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
history of how each division has um set
 
05:16:04.310 --> 05:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
up their granting process for this fund
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
it's been incredibly successful um we do
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
as a state spend I think 50,000 a year
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
on marketing for this and that's paid
 
05:16:18.110 --> 05:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.590 --> 05:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.750 --> 05:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
money I didn't know we had a state
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.548 --> 05:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
nonprofit no the commission that
 
05:16:39.830 --> 05:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
oversees is there specific commission
 
05:16:41.788 --> 05:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
that oversees this fund yeah are you are
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
you talking about the state conservation
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
committee one of the recipients of the
 
05:16:47.788 --> 05:16:47.798 align:start position:0%
funding yeah there's a there's a
 
05:16:50.510 --> 05:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee that that is convened that
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
also that I believe runs
 
05:17:01.548 --> 05:17:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:05.430 --> 05:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
fund you have a way of telling what
 
05:17:08.910 --> 05:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
percentage goes to each of these groups
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
is it variable by year I didn't have
 
05:17:13.390 --> 05:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
that on sorry yeah it's it's actually
 
05:17:18.430 --> 05:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
fixed in statute so it started out so uh
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
we we receive 40% of the distribution uh
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
the fish and game department receives
 
05:17:28.190 --> 05:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
20% uh and the state conservation
 
05:17:29.350 --> 05:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee and New Hampshire land and
 
05:17:30.868 --> 05:17:30.878 align:start position:0%
Community investment Authority I believe
 
05:17:32.548 --> 05:17:32.558 align:start position:0%
they each get
 
05:17:35.548 --> 05:17:35.558 align:start position:0%
20% or some one gets 20 and one gets
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
some amount so yes but it's it's defined
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
in statute it's very specific before we
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
were uh combined between the department
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
of culture resources and Dread we were
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
each receiving 20% so when we were
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
brought together as natural and cultural
 
05:17:54.270 --> 05:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
resources we now receive 40% so we do
 
05:17:57.788 --> 05:17:57.798 align:start position:0%
still the same amount that was allocated
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
um before we were
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
separate so why is there even a balance
 
05:18:05.948 --> 05:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
here you would think a certain amount
 
05:18:08.548 --> 05:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
came from the plates you're getting 40%
 
05:18:12.110 --> 05:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
goes here 20 goes there you know Etc and
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
then it would be gone right yeah oh so
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the
 
05:18:19.948 --> 05:18:19.958 align:start position:0%
table okay so this table is only depicts
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
the funds that are coming into our
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
department this is not a depiction of
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
the entire oh I see plate fund for the
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
state got we we can only speak to what
 
05:18:33.868 --> 05:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
we're managing um so we have yes we've
 
05:18:33.878 --> 05:18:35.110 align:start position:0%
we're managing um so we have yes we've
been

05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:18:37.470 --> 05:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
spending and receiving healthy amounts
 
05:18:40.350 --> 05:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
it has continued to to grow we just
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
received a distribution actually
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
yesterday of um $1.2
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
million for our agency Alone um so that
 
05:18:52.628 --> 05:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
will be distributed within the agency
 
05:18:54.750 --> 05:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
and then of course I'm sure there are
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
lots of plans to to spend those funds
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
yeah each of the divisions um work with
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
their staff to stand up Grant fund you
 
05:19:04.350 --> 05:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
know granting
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
opportunities um if I could turn to the
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
team Ben you do a pretty aggressive job
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
pushing out these Grant dollars can you
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
give an example so uh we've been
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
spending over the last Ben Wilson
 
05:19:19.708 --> 05:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
director of the division of historical
 
05:19:22.110 --> 05:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
resources um we've been spending over
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
the last um about four or five years uh
 
05:19:29.310 --> 05:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
260 240
 
05:19:33.390 --> 05:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
$260,000 in uh grants uh to local
 
05:19:37.110 --> 05:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities um those uh range about
 
05:19:39.990 --> 05:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
between 10 and $20,000 a
 
05:19:43.150 --> 05:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
piece got a band stand restored at my
 
05:19:47.670 --> 05:19:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:50.830 --> 05:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
beautiful okay so I see so so the point
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
is you can't sort of simply put this in
 
05:19:55.708 --> 05:19:55.718 align:start position:0%
your Parks fund or something right
 
05:19:57.430 --> 05:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
because it has to be used for these
 
05:20:01.110 --> 05:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of St things right from the statue
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
okay all right very good other
 
05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
questions no all right we're happy with
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
this one 6 eight since we're on historic
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
one so this fund was set up several
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
years ago um to administer a grant
 
05:20:28.350 --> 05:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
program from the National Park Service
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
and it was uh geared
 
05:20:33.868 --> 05:20:33.878 align:start position:0%
towards um sending grants out for the
 
05:20:37.470 --> 05:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
restoration of agricultural buildings so
 
05:20:40.948 --> 05:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
barns um blacksmith's shops chicken
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
coups um Carriage sheds those kinds of
 
05:20:46.150 --> 05:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
things everything but the
 
05:20:50.868 --> 05:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
Farmhouse um those monies were uh spent
 
05:20:54.030 --> 05:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
and uh there has not been another uh
 
05:20:56.190 --> 05:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
grant program from the National Park
 
05:21:00.910 --> 05:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
Service since um during that time uh the
 
05:21:05.150 --> 05:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
barn committee um was set up and uh to
 
05:21:07.830 --> 05:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
this day meets quarterly and does an
 
05:21:12.270 --> 05:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
annual trip to a farm um or multiple
 
05:21:16.750 --> 05:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
farms uh in the month of July to um go
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
through a property help out a homeowner
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh Farm owner with advice on how to
 
05:21:24.868 --> 05:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
repair um restore their buildings or
 
05:21:26.750 --> 05:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
care for them or come up with adaptive
 
05:21:29.070 --> 05:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
reuse Barns and agricultural buildings
 
05:21:32.030 --> 05:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
in the state are likened to are the
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
rural versions of our Mills in our uh
 
05:21:39.788 --> 05:21:39.798 align:start position:0%
cities and larger towns um and so at the
 
05:21:42.830 --> 05:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
time that that Grant um fund was created
 
05:21:44.350 --> 05:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
at the National Park Service at the
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
national level um it was recognized that
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
we were losing these buildings from our
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh landscape at a at an alarming rate um
 
05:21:56.190 --> 05:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
and it was very successful I wish the
 
05:21:57.830 --> 05:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
Park Service would step up again and do
 
05:22:00.190 --> 05:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
it again um and if we were to receive
 
05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
funds this is where they would be parked
 
05:22:04.628 --> 05:22:04.638 align:start position:0%
so this committee doesn't have any
 
05:22:06.750 --> 05:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
expenses or you pay for them out of
 
05:22:08.628 --> 05:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
something else there's no expenses we
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
aren't allowed to supp they don't get
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
snacks at their meeting I was going to
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
say we don't allow we don't allow snacks
 
05:22:15.548 --> 05:22:15.558 align:start position:0%
or bottles of water or
 
05:22:18.030 --> 05:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
mileage or mileage to go to the barn
 
05:22:20.110 --> 05:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
there's no mileage no it's a Frugal
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
group okay very they're Farmers yeah
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
Farm okay um so maybe we should get rid
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
of this one oh and there's one other
 
05:22:31.788 --> 05:22:31.798 align:start position:0%
thing it says it's
 
05:22:34.910 --> 05:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
doing it says that that they are
 
05:22:38.190 --> 05:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
preparing to publish a second edition of
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
their book on how to restore barns uh
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes so uh John Porter uh who used to be
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
with uh UNH
 
05:22:50.628 --> 05:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
extension um in their
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
um uh in their um uh Dairy and goat side
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
of their business um he um was the
 
05:23:02.110 --> 05:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
author with with other folks editing uh
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
of the first uh New Hampshire Barn book
 
05:23:08.590 --> 05:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
um that has since the second edition
 
05:23:12.270 --> 05:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
actually has been published and um and
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're collecting funds that go into a
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
different account actually another um to
 
05:23:21.190 --> 05:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
support uh further um publishing of that
 
05:23:23.470 --> 05:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
book and edits to that for a third
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
edition probably within the next four to
 
05:23:30.590 --> 05:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
five years a any of this go for covered
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah so we ought to leave it alone in
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
case another rant comes in I gu and if
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
we took it away why would these people
 
05:23:49.190 --> 05:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
keep driving around
 
05:23:51.230 --> 05:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
visiting I mean they're they're
 
05:23:53.670 --> 05:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
providing a good service for free for
 
05:23:56.830 --> 05:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
somebody so that's true and we and we do
 
05:23:59.230 --> 05:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
hope that um that there will be an
 
05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity um to have Grant funds uh
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
for this purpose or a similar purpose
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
all right representative Jan um is there
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
you just said you to have some more
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
Grant funds is there a website or is
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
there something pointing people to it
 
05:24:16.430 --> 05:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
because you know if there's something
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
that excites people about it they may
 
05:24:19.910 --> 05:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
donate but if they don't know about it
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen uh so on the
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
tra I believe it's on the travel and
 
05:24:27.310 --> 05:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
tourism uh website one of the products
 
05:24:29.070 --> 05:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
that our committee worked very hard on
 
05:24:30.788 --> 05:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
over the last two years is creating a
 
05:24:33.750 --> 05:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
barn tour so much like a cheese tour or
 
05:24:36.990 --> 05:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
an ice cream tour in the state um we've
 
05:24:41.150 --> 05:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
developed uh there's a site and um and a
 
05:24:44.230 --> 05:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
an actual map uh that you can get um
 
05:24:46.590 --> 05:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
from travel and tourism that guides you
 
05:24:49.230 --> 05:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
to various barns um that are in the
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
public domain um that can be viewed and
 
05:24:53.948 --> 05:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
toured or might have an interpretive
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
panel outside of them so again this is
 
05:24:59.230 --> 05:24:59.240 align:start position:0%
another another instance where you have
 
05:25:03.030 --> 05:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
um volunteers doing good work um and
 
05:25:04.830 --> 05:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
producing something for the betterment
 
05:25:08.590 --> 05:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
of the state I I think um and we did
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
receive from um the Department of
 
05:25:13.948 --> 05:25:13.958 align:start position:0%
Agriculture uh a
 
05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
$3,000 uh Grant um that didn't go into
 
05:25:19.548 --> 05:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
this fund uh it had to go through travel
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
and tourism to support that website and
 
05:25:25.708 --> 05:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
printing of the barn tour map I mean it
 
05:25:27.990 --> 05:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like a potentially interesting
 
05:25:30.548 --> 05:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
tour uh but it looks like nobody has
 
05:25:33.310 --> 05:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
donated in the last four years um is
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
there any way that we can uh I mean
 
05:25:37.590 --> 05:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're saying there's a website where
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
somebody could but is there anything
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
else you think could be done to get
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
people they probably don't have the QR
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
code on the booklet right that's to to
 
05:25:48.150 --> 05:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
to put money in this fund you know
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
because nobody El the the website may
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
not have a button either the new
 
05:25:55.310 --> 05:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
Administration may have a more active
 
05:25:57.470 --> 05:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
05:26:00.230 --> 05:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
always yeah so is can the website be
 
05:26:06.110 --> 05:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
enhanced in a way that you know makes it
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
more obvious that people can donate and
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
and which is a great question we we have
 
05:26:12.510 --> 05:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
been working closely with travel and
 
05:26:17.150 --> 05:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
tourism to um to uh update that website
 
05:26:20.750 --> 05:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
um landing page and to uh um I don't
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe we have a donation uh button on
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
that and that's certainly a would be a
 
05:26:27.390 --> 05:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
great idea and this could be a place
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
where those monies could go it seems to
 
05:26:32.868 --> 05:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
me like it's it it very well could be
 
05:26:35.070 --> 05:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
successful because there's still plenty
 
05:26:37.150 --> 05:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
of people that enjoy looking at
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
historical sites and
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it sounds interesting I mean I think
 
05:26:44.270 --> 05:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
getting just directing eyeballs to that
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
point where they can donate I think you
 
05:26:49.310 --> 05:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
know might work it's a great idea
 
05:26:53.350 --> 05:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I I could call Lori Hara and
 
05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
ask her about the
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
brochure um all right so we'll leave
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
this for now is that the consensus yes
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right next
 
05:27:08.990 --> 05:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
one uh now we got the state
 
05:27:09.000 --> 05:27:12.708 align:start position:0%
one uh now we got the state
Library

05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:16.670 --> 05:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
101 page uh 10
 
05:27:19.110 --> 05:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
yep and it's hidden under the name
 
05:27:21.750 --> 05:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
automated information
 
05:27:24.430 --> 05:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
systems yeah Michael can you put your
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
microphone on and and then you can give
 
05:27:26.480 --> 05:27:28.190 align:start position:0%
microphone on and and then you can give
a

05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:27:30.910 --> 05:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
summary uh my name is Michael yor I'm
 
05:27:32.470 --> 05:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
the director of the division of
 
05:27:35.948 --> 05:27:35.958 align:start position:0%
libraries also uh State
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
librarian excuse me you probably need to
 
05:27:42.510 --> 05:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
you live York just just like the state
 
05:27:47.040 --> 05:27:47.590 align:start position:0%
you live York just just like the state
like

05:27:47.590 --> 05:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:27:47.600 --> 05:27:53.868 align:start position:0%
like
[Laughter]

05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
new uh the State Library provides
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
services to the 234 public libraries in
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:28:07.470 --> 05:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
um 75% of our libraries are in
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
communities that that serve fewer than
 
05:28:12.628 --> 05:28:12.638 align:start position:0%
7500 people so they are by
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
definition resource
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
challenged and so the State library for
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
many years has provided uh services that
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
can't be provided by anybody else in the
 
05:28:28.590 --> 05:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
state inter Library loan is a key
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
element of this because many of our
 
05:28:34.270 --> 05:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
libraries can't afford to purchase
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
materials and now we have the ability
 
05:28:39.788 --> 05:28:39.798 align:start position:0%
with the phisticated automation systems
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we have to identify the Holdings of
 
05:28:45.628 --> 05:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
all of these libraries so we have what's
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
known as a union catalog of Holdings
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
that has almost 3,000 records three
 
05:28:55.310 --> 05:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
million records in it that identifies um
 
05:28:58.430 --> 05:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
materials and who owns them we also
 
05:29:01.310 --> 05:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
provide the transportation system that
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
moves materials from one to another uh
 
05:29:06.670 --> 05:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
we often get the question why isn't all
 
05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
of this stuff digitized well it's being
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
digitized but um uh people are still
 
05:29:17.230 --> 05:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
primarily reading uh printed word on
 
05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
paper and will for for a while but uh
 
05:29:23.190 --> 05:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
for the time being we have lots of
 
05:29:25.868 --> 05:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
libraries uh relying on that and that's
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
how that's why we built uh the New
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire automated information system
 
05:29:35.948 --> 05:29:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
1984 part of that is that um there is a
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
provider that we use that has uh that
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
provides the metadata that's necessary
 
05:29:50.430 --> 05:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
for these materials to go into for the
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
the information to go into this
 
05:29:55.230 --> 05:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
automated information system uh so that
 
05:29:58.350 --> 05:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
the libraries can find the materials and
 
05:30:00.590 --> 05:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine that's not an
 
05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
inexpensive uh service the last time we
 
05:30:06.750 --> 05:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
replaced our automation system it cost
 
05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
so we do charge for some
 
05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
Services we don't charge for the
 
05:30:18.190 --> 05:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
transportation of the materials for
 
05:30:21.150 --> 05:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
example but if libraries want additional
 
05:30:23.190 --> 05:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
records uh we charge them and that's
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
what this um dedicated fund is for uh
 
05:30:29.788 --> 05:30:29.798 align:start position:0%
you can see that there was a large
 
05:30:32.270 --> 05:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
expenditure in 20 and
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
21 that was because that's when we were
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
replacing our um system and putting in
 
05:30:40.670 --> 05:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the new system I mentioned that that
 
05:30:44.510 --> 05:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
cost us uh two uh $25
 
05:30:49.830 --> 05:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
million so we do need this uh we we do
 
05:30:53.230 --> 05:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
need this Fund in order to uh to take in
 
05:30:55.390 --> 05:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
the funds that we get from the libraries
 
05:30:57.948 --> 05:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
and to on occasion spend money for
 
05:31:00.390 --> 05:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
services that the libraries
 
05:31:02.670 --> 05:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
use well it doesn't look like you're
 
05:31:04.750 --> 05:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
getting any funds from libraries right
 
05:31:07.110 --> 05:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's been no income for three years
 
05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
right it's down because of the
 
05:31:12.030 --> 05:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
digitization of things we used to we
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
used to provide actual catalog cards to
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
to libraries and we don't do that
 
05:31:19.990 --> 05:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
anymore so that's why the the service is
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
down there are very few libraries that
 
05:31:24.230 --> 05:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
do that right but the revenue are you
 
05:31:26.110 --> 05:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
saying money gets transferred from those
 
05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
libraries or they were transferring
 
05:31:31.390 --> 05:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
money to us for those cards but they
 
05:31:33.628 --> 05:31:33.638 align:start position:0%
don't any they don't do that anymore I
 
05:31:38.030 --> 05:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
see um so why
 
05:31:40.230 --> 05:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
what were these big numbers allocations
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
from the general
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
fund um
 
05:31:48.548 --> 05:31:48.558 align:start position:0%
no those were
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
um we also set up a
 
05:31:51.360 --> 05:31:52.868 align:start position:0%
um we also set up a
system

05:31:52.868 --> 05:31:52.878 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:31:57.708 --> 05:31:57.718 align:start position:0%
uh known as nay local and it was to help
 
05:32:00.990 --> 05:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
the smaller libraries actually purchase
 
05:32:03.310 --> 05:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
an automation system many of our
 
05:32:06.590 --> 05:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
libraries were not able to do that um in
 
05:32:08.670 --> 05:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
the Manchester area area all of the
 
05:32:11.470 --> 05:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
libraries have their have a system but
 
05:32:14.190 --> 05:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
in Errol they're challenged to try and
 
05:32:16.750 --> 05:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
get an automation system so we set up
 
05:32:20.230 --> 05:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
this additional service called nay local
 
05:32:22.510 --> 05:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
which helped those libraries get that
 
05:32:24.470 --> 05:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
and they had to to pay for it the
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
advantage was it was much cheaper for
 
05:32:28.910 --> 05:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
them to do this through us than it was
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
for them to do it on their
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
own uh yes representative
 
05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
Wy you already have a separate
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the State library is
 
05:32:41.190 --> 05:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
that correct I think you're the head of
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
that yes so that's a separate
 
05:32:48.190 --> 05:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's not included in
 
05:32:51.430 --> 05:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
here correct not in not in this not in
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
this fund yeah so State library is still
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
alive and well and supported through
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
other Appropriations is that correct
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
correct we can use
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
more can't we all thank you
 
05:33:08.558 --> 05:33:09.868 align:start position:0%
more can't we all thank you
representative

05:33:09.868 --> 05:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:33:13.830 --> 05:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
J so I mean to me the obvious
 
05:33:13.840 --> 05:33:15.548 align:start position:0%
J so I mean to me the obvious
question

05:33:15.548 --> 05:33:15.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:33:20.990 --> 05:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
is with no Revenue a balance down to
 
05:33:25.670 --> 05:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
4,900 how can this fund continue to
 
05:33:28.910 --> 05:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
operate well it's you're right it's it's
 
05:33:33.548 --> 05:33:33.558 align:start position:0%
it has has diminished over time but
 
05:33:37.110 --> 05:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't see any need to to to do away
 
05:33:39.150 --> 05:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
with it just because the funds are low
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
we may have something that we'll need in
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
the future uh yeah I'm not suggesting
 
05:33:46.830 --> 05:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
getting rid of it I'm just saying it's
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
it's going to become ineffective unless
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
there is unless you have a plan for how
 
05:33:53.310 --> 05:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
new revenue is going to come into it and
 
05:33:55.708 --> 05:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we are doing is
 
05:33:57.750 --> 05:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
trying to bring more of the smaller
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
libraries into our organization that
 
05:34:06.350 --> 05:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
system and how how do they get help
 
05:34:09.990 --> 05:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
purchas where does that money come from
 
05:34:13.510 --> 05:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
oh it comes from the the local community
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay we're providing the expertise that
 
05:34:18.948 --> 05:34:18.958 align:start position:0%
they don't have quite frankly to
 
05:34:22.310 --> 05:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
purchase that but the funds come from
 
05:34:24.350 --> 05:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
the uh individual
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
communities we currently have 22
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
libraries that are part of this this
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
Consortium of libraries so if a new one
 
05:34:35.030 --> 05:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
came along would the money they they
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
spend go into this fund and then you
 
05:34:41.470 --> 05:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
would pay the vendor yes okay okay thank
 
05:34:43.470 --> 05:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
but well I'm confused because if you
 
05:34:46.750 --> 05:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
have 22 libraries now in this Consortium
 
05:34:49.628 --> 05:34:49.638 align:start position:0%
why is revenue still
 
05:34:53.150 --> 05:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
zero um because what we're paying for is
 
05:34:57.628 --> 05:34:57.638 align:start position:0%
the initial cost to to set these up they
 
05:35:00.390 --> 05:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
have to take their data and convert it
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
there's a cost associated with that they
 
05:35:05.390 --> 05:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
have to make the initial payment to the
 
05:35:08.390 --> 05:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
to the vendor for the training Etc that
 
05:35:11.070 --> 05:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
goes on I mean we've gotten to a point
 
05:35:12.470 --> 05:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
where we're not getting many more
 
05:35:15.830 --> 05:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
libraries that's correct so uh we may
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
need to we may need to rethink this have
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
the 22 been in there for a while yes
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
okay so that's why there's no
 
05:35:28.310 --> 05:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
new activity we set this up
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
in uh 2015 I
 
05:35:34.830 --> 05:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
think so how I mean I guess I still
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
don't understand how you're going to get
 
05:35:38.230 --> 05:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
new Revenue
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
well if we had another Library
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
joined there would be the need to to
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
provide them with
 
05:35:49.708 --> 05:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
services and to con for instance to
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
convert their data it would cost them um
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
a certain amount for each record that
 
05:35:56.708 --> 05:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
they need to convert into a m machine
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
readable format because many of these
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
libraries quite frankly had the
 
05:36:04.470 --> 05:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
oldfashioned card
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
cataloges and now that data has to be
 
05:36:09.548 --> 05:36:09.558 align:start position:0%
inverted and they can't do it and we
 
05:36:12.110 --> 05:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
can't do it you usually have to hire the
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
the vendor will take care of that as
 
05:36:15.788 --> 05:36:15.798 align:start position:0%
part so then you don't anticipate any
 
05:36:19.470 --> 05:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
expenses no okay I guess I yeah I looked
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
at 20 22 and 23 and saw $50,000 in
 
05:36:25.868 --> 05:36:25.878 align:start position:0%
expenses I thought how you know 5,000
 
05:36:27.868 --> 05:36:27.878 align:start position:0%
left but if there's no additional
 
05:36:30.830 --> 05:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
expenses right now you don't need
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue right just point okay are the
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
software maintenance expenses for Na AIS
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
just part of your regular budget for our
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
system they are yeah but for the systems
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
that we have helped for the libraries
 
05:36:51.350 --> 05:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
that we've helped join our service they
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
take they take care of those directly to
 
05:36:56.390 --> 05:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the vendor directly to the vendor I see
 
05:36:56.400 --> 05:36:57.190 align:start position:0%
the vendor directly to the vendor I see
all

05:36:57.190 --> 05:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
right uh rep Senator rosan
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
you um does does the State library
 
05:37:08.230 --> 05:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
system have
 
05:37:11.310 --> 05:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
any relationship with the university
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
system libraries and the community
 
05:37:17.910 --> 05:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
colleges are they part of the
 
05:37:21.708 --> 05:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
databases well they are part of our
 
05:37:24.670 --> 05:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
inter Library loan Network so for
 
05:37:25.868 --> 05:37:25.878 align:start position:0%
example if
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
you if you go to the basement of our
 
05:37:32.110 --> 05:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
library you'll see that we have a Depot
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
there for transferring materials from
 
05:37:36.750 --> 05:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
one library to another and all of the
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
college libr
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
are in that
 
05:37:43.548 --> 05:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
system so if Dartmouth is lending a book
 
05:37:46.350 --> 05:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester City Library it comes
 
05:37:46.360 --> 05:37:47.230 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester City Library it comes
through

05:37:47.230 --> 05:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
us and they also have the ability to go
 
05:37:52.350 --> 05:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
onto our catalog and find out who owns
 
05:37:54.150 --> 05:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
this there's
 
05:37:57.310 --> 05:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
a there's not as close a relationship as
 
05:38:00.190 --> 05:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
we would like with the uh with the
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
university system but they have a
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
so who's who pays for the physical
 
05:38:17.190 --> 05:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
transport of books from dth through the
 
05:38:21.430 --> 05:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
State library to somebody in Hollis the
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
State Library primarily using our
 
05:38:24.480 --> 05:38:26.230 align:start position:0%
State Library primarily using our
federal

05:38:26.230 --> 05:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
funds we receive about 1.5 million a
 
05:38:31.868 --> 05:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
year from The Institute of Museum and
 
05:38:34.628 --> 05:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
Library services this money is given to
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
us after we develop A Five-Year Plan
 
05:38:40.750 --> 05:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
which they accept and then we use and
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
and a major component of our Five-Year
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
Plan for the last 25 years has been to
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
maintain this inter Library loan Network
 
05:38:50.070 --> 05:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
05:38:53.390 --> 05:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
critical to the citizens in New
 
05:38:55.390 --> 05:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of
 
05:38:59.270 --> 05:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
the unique rural character of our state
 
05:39:00.590 --> 05:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
we're we're a little different than a
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
lot of States
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
because through graduate school without
 
05:39:06.830 --> 05:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
it what's that I wouldn't have gotten
 
05:39:09.628 --> 05:39:09.638 align:start position:0%
through graduate school with them right
 
05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
our state is a little different in terms
 
05:39:14.468 --> 05:39:14.478 align:start position:0%
of Library Services CU we still have
 
05:39:14.478 --> 05:39:16.190 align:start position:0%
of Library Services CU we still have
234

05:39:16.190 --> 05:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
234
 
05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
independent libraries run by their own
 
05:39:20.628 --> 05:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and their own
 
05:39:24.750 --> 05:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
Administration it makes things a little
 
05:39:27.030 --> 05:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
clunky it really is like Santa's
 
05:39:28.788 --> 05:39:28.798 align:start position:0%
Workshop in the basement of the State
 
05:39:30.948 --> 05:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
library on any given day with various
 
05:39:33.390 --> 05:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
van drivers coming with their bins
 
05:39:35.150 --> 05:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
putting things together putting things
 
05:39:36.868 --> 05:39:36.878 align:start position:0%
away and they've really formed wonderful
 
05:39:38.628 --> 05:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
relationship ship with the local
 
05:39:40.830 --> 05:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
Librarians um because they know when the
 
05:39:43.070 --> 05:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
van comes there they have the the books
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
that have been requested by their
 
05:39:47.788 --> 05:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
patrons um but with with running that
 
05:39:50.110 --> 05:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
process you get to understand a a little
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
bit about what readers in New Hampshire
 
05:39:52.320 --> 05:39:53.390 align:start position:0%
bit about what readers in New Hampshire
are

05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
into and I asked uh recently what what
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
are readers in New Hampshire looking for
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
right now and apparently it's Amish
 
05:40:10.230 --> 05:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.910 --> 05:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
should we leave this one for another
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
five years and and if it becomes it no
 
05:40:17.788 --> 05:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
activity at all then we'll get rid of it
 
05:40:19.750 --> 05:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
does that make
 
05:40:21.670 --> 05:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
sense if
 
05:40:24.468 --> 05:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
someday if someday the technology
 
05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
changes again they're going to need
 
05:40:30.830 --> 05:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
that I suppose right but they'll
 
05:40:33.270 --> 05:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
probably get a a capital budget uh
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
allocation rather than this but yeah who
 
05:40:36.240 --> 05:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
allocation rather than this but yeah who
knows

05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
knows
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
that make sense yeah we're happy all
 
05:40:44.910 --> 05:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
right next one is uh 102 the next page
 
05:40:52.868 --> 05:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
books lost lost and
 
05:41:02.468 --> 05:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
damage uh this is this is a standard uh
 
05:41:06.628 --> 05:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
practice of of all libraries um we're
 
05:41:10.350 --> 05:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
more than will to lend materials to the
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
patrons in our
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
communities but we expect them to we
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
expect them to return them in as close
 
05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
to the initial state that they took it
 
05:41:24.468 --> 05:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
out as possible and when that doesn't
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
happen um I have to send a letter a
 
05:41:29.070 --> 05:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
registered letter according to the
 
05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
statutes uh it's against the law to
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
retain a library book longer than uh the
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
time that's been assigned to you um
 
05:41:40.030 --> 05:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh we don't like to do this it's it's
 
05:41:43.230 --> 05:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
not good public relations obviously um
 
05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
but um we do have the the statute to
 
05:41:48.270 --> 05:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
back us up that if somebody has not
 
05:41:49.788 --> 05:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
returned a book and we've made a good
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
effort to try and get it back from them
 
05:41:54.670 --> 05:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
that we can then charge them the cost of
 
05:41:57.510 --> 05:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
the book and also the cost to process
 
05:41:59.468 --> 05:41:59.478 align:start position:0%
that book to put back on the shelves and
 
05:42:02.190 --> 05:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this uh damaged and
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
lost book uh account Senator gray the
 
05:42:08.868 --> 05:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
way you work Ed that it sounded like you
 
05:42:12.430 --> 05:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to send certified letters
 
05:42:14.628 --> 05:42:14.638 align:start position:0%
anymore I never like to send the
 
05:42:17.070 --> 05:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
certified letters well certified letter
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
is probably going to cost you what four
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
to8 oh well I and I guess I misspoke I
 
05:42:24.910 --> 05:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't mean a certified I mean uh a
 
05:42:26.750 --> 05:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
letter that clearly indicates that we
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
know that they've still got the book um
 
05:42:32.070 --> 05:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
so we send a letter to them and I cite
 
05:42:34.430 --> 05:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
the statute uh that says they're not
 
05:42:37.948 --> 05:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
permitted to to retain library books uh
 
05:42:41.190 --> 05:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
unless we've authorized them uh to do so
 
05:42:45.150 --> 05:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
and and then um most often we get the
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
books back um so that's why we have this
 
05:42:51.708 --> 05:42:51.718 align:start position:0%
uh in place and as I say this is sort
 
05:42:53.910 --> 05:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is a standard practice in in
 
05:43:00.708 --> 05:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
library in the library um field uh to to
 
05:43:03.670 --> 05:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh make people aware that they have to
 
05:43:07.948 --> 05:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
pay for materials that they damage
 
05:43:12.030 --> 05:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
so you've had a significant shortfall um
 
05:43:14.990 --> 05:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
the last three of the last four
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
years um in terms of uh expenses
 
05:43:21.990 --> 05:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
exceeding Revenue do you need to charge
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
are well I think that could
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
be that could be for a couple of um a
 
05:43:35.350 --> 05:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
number of reasons one being that um
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
people are better about returning books
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
or that um people are not borrowing as
 
05:43:44.548 --> 05:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
much as they as they used to um we're
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
not really uh I always try to make it
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
clear we're not a public library our
 
05:43:51.190 --> 05:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
collection doesn't
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
reflect uh the commissioner mentioned
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
Amish romances uh I don't I don't
 
05:43:58.990 --> 05:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
believe I don't believe you'll find an
 
05:44:01.110 --> 05:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
Amish romance in the New Hampshire State
 
05:44:03.548 --> 05:44:03.558 align:start position:0%
Library collection what you will find
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
are the statutes you'll find all kinds
 
05:44:08.190 --> 05:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
of material that supports state
 
05:44:10.708 --> 05:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
government and information that we think
 
05:44:14.270 --> 05:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
that the uh patrons and in this case the
 
05:44:16.150 --> 05:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
citizens in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
would find uh interesting we don't have
 
05:44:23.070 --> 05:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
a large uh medical collection obviously
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
um we don't have and we don't have a lot
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
of literature or uh uh novels uh you
 
05:44:33.310 --> 05:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
won't find best sellers in our
 
05:44:33.320 --> 05:44:34.830 align:start position:0%
won't find best sellers in our
collection

05:44:34.830 --> 05:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
collection
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
and candidly more people are getting
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
their materials through uh Amazon and
 
05:44:45.788 --> 05:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
lots of other uh sources so I I think
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's um that's a reason why you would
 
05:44:52.670 --> 05:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
find that our U uh our Revenue would be
 
05:44:55.070 --> 05:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
down we're just not a we're not losing
 
05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
as much as we've lost the it's not a
 
05:44:59.590 --> 05:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
revenue issue it's it's it's just the
 
05:45:03.390 --> 05:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
expenses seem quite fairly great right
 
05:45:08.510 --> 05:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
so you you have Revenue of5 00 1,200
 
05:45:11.708 --> 05:45:11.718 align:start position:0%
1300 but you've got expenses of 3,000
 
05:45:14.190 --> 05:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
8,000 right
 
05:45:17.590 --> 05:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
so if you had two more years like this
 
05:45:23.110 --> 05:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:25.150 --> 05:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
empty wait
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
see right again our purpose for for for
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
having this is just the mechanism to uh
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
put the money into a fund so that we can
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
use it to actually replace the book
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't think that that um if if
 
05:45:44.110 --> 05:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
the and it could be that the book is not
 
05:45:46.270 --> 05:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
going to be replaced either it can't be
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
because it's no longer available from a
 
05:45:53.670 --> 05:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
a uh jobber uh or it's something that we
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
don't think fits with our collection
 
05:45:58.830 --> 05:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
development policy or it's Antiquated in
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.230 --> 05:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
that so again we've set this up just so
 
05:46:07.750 --> 05:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we can collect from representative
 
05:46:10.830 --> 05:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
Jan again yeah I I'm just along that
 
05:46:14.070 --> 05:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
same line of questioning obviously 2024
 
05:46:17.230 --> 05:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
the expense is uh more than double what
 
05:46:18.788 --> 05:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
it's been do you know what why that
 
05:46:23.070 --> 05:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:25.548 --> 05:46:25.558 align:start position:0%
8500 I I don't have an answer for that
 
05:46:28.350 --> 05:46:28.360 align:start position:0%
rock the top of my
 
05:46:30.548 --> 05:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
head it's just if you want to continue
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
to rely on this fund you might consider
 
05:46:33.200 --> 05:46:34.310 align:start position:0%
to rely on this fund you might consider
charging

05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
charging
 
05:46:36.628 --> 05:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
more or spending less you know one of
 
05:46:36.638 --> 05:46:37.910 align:start position:0%
more or spending less you know one of
the

05:46:37.910 --> 05:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
okay um we're not going to get rid of
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
this one so yeah we're happy all right
 
05:46:49.110 --> 05:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.120 --> 05:46:51.468 align:start position:0%
 
one

05:46:51.468 --> 05:46:51.478 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:46:54.070 --> 05:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay um there's one more Library one
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:57.200 --> 05:46:59.390 align:start position:0%
 
179

05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
179
 
05:47:03.390 --> 05:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
um on page 19 of
 
05:47:08.350 --> 05:47:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:10.830 --> 05:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
Family Resource connection genealogy and
 
05:47:13.350 --> 05:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
talking book this is interesting right
 
05:47:17.468 --> 05:47:17.478 align:start position:0%
the Family Resource connection no longer
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
exists um that was a a unit within the
 
05:47:23.590 --> 05:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
State library that we set
 
05:47:23.600 --> 05:47:26.030 align:start position:0%
State library that we set
up

05:47:26.030 --> 05:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:47:30.390 --> 05:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
um two in 2000 I believe
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
um and so it it's no longer there we
 
05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
have an extensive genealogy collection
 
05:47:38.110 --> 05:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
and we provide services to
 
05:47:41.190 --> 05:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
the the term used to be the Blind and
 
05:47:43.590 --> 05:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
Physically handicapped it's now the
 
05:47:43.600 --> 05:47:45.788 align:start position:0%
Physically handicapped it's now the
print

05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
print
 
05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
disabled so um again we use this to uh
 
05:47:56.948 --> 05:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
accept uh gifts that we get and talking
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
books um quite frankly receives a lot of
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
attention a lot of people rely on our
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
talking books service um we have about
 
05:48:11.390 --> 05:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
2500 clients in New Hampshire and we're
 
05:48:14.548 --> 05:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
doing most of the services of this type
 
05:48:19.350 --> 05:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
for the blind uh and um print disabled
 
05:48:23.230 --> 05:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
um and it's not uncommon I get letters
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
all the time from family members talking
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
about how important the service was uh
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
to their relative their father their
 
05:48:35.788 --> 05:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
mother um and we have an absolutely
 
05:48:37.548 --> 05:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
fabulous staff
 
05:48:39.150 --> 05:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know somebody will call up
 
05:48:41.350 --> 05:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
ostensively because they want to borrow
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
a book they want a book from we send
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
them a catalog and then we send them the
 
05:48:47.440 --> 05:48:48.628 align:start position:0%
them a catalog and then we send them the
the

05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:48:51.468 --> 05:48:51.478 align:start position:0%
uh uh the flash drives these are all
 
05:48:53.670 --> 05:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
provided by the Library of Congress the
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
service has been around for almost a
 
05:48:57.708 --> 05:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
hundred years it started in the early
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
30s um and the
 
05:49:05.708 --> 05:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
um so we will have people call up
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
ostensibly because they want to borrow a
 
05:49:09.750 --> 05:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
book or they have a question but really
 
05:49:12.230 --> 05:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
they just want to talk to somebody
 
05:49:15.030 --> 05:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
because they haven't talked to their son
 
05:49:18.430 --> 05:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
or daughter for a uh time so our staff
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
almost asks like counselors quite
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
frankly and they do an outstanding job
 
05:49:26.948 --> 05:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
and so it's not unusual for us to get uh
 
05:49:29.990 --> 05:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
named in people's Wills because they are
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the services that we've
 
05:49:35.230 --> 05:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
provided um
 
05:49:37.390 --> 05:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:49:39.150 --> 05:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
talking book service in New Hampshire
 
05:49:45.070 --> 05:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
has been in place for uh um 50
 
05:49:50.270 --> 05:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
years and uh still going we have changed
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
with the times we're now using we
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
started off with vinyl discs um the
 
05:49:59.590 --> 05:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
Library of Congress didn't go to uh CD
 
05:50:02.430 --> 05:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
ROMs they
 
05:50:05.270 --> 05:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
um they went to cassettes and didn't
 
05:50:08.110 --> 05:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
change to the CD ROM uh what they
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
finally did was to develop a uh an
 
05:50:15.510 --> 05:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
inexpensive way through um uh flash
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
drives to do this so talking books is
 
05:50:20.670 --> 05:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
located up on the hospital grounds in
 
05:50:24.510 --> 05:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
building sounds like sen this may be one
 
05:50:32.670 --> 05:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
for uh at least an update in the statute
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
you know so that you can take out your
 
05:50:50.548 --> 05:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:53.190 --> 05:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
let them do again because he's going to
 
05:50:56.310 --> 05:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:01.030 --> 05:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:22.150 --> 05:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.430 --> 05:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to 103 I guess is that
 
05:51:28.910 --> 05:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.920 --> 05:51:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
one

05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:37.150 --> 05:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
art m
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
M hi there Adele Sicilia I'm the
 
05:51:42.750 --> 05:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
director for the the division of
 
05:51:47.548 --> 05:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:47.558 --> 05:51:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:51:54.910 --> 05:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:59.948 --> 05:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
yeah sure Cecilia s i
 
05:52:04.510 --> 05:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
c i l i
 
05:52:08.708 --> 05:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
a that's okay I'm sorry I
 
05:52:08.718 --> 05:52:10.788 align:start position:0%
a that's okay I'm sorry I
mean

05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:52:13.590 --> 05:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
gotta all
 
05:52:18.190 --> 05:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
right so one half of 1% of the first $15
 
05:52:21.310 --> 05:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
million goes to
 
05:52:24.750 --> 05:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
Art right this seems Universal
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere I could tell you stories of
 
05:52:31.230 --> 05:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
strange things that passed for art and
 
05:52:34.750 --> 05:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
new airport is
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
gend know different cultures different
 
05:52:40.670 --> 05:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
heritages yeah spending money on
 
05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
everything so one of them was have these
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
frames that go from one to another yes
 
05:52:50.628 --> 05:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
someone has these little Spinners on the
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
wall like they came out of a dryer or
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
something so when wind forced by the
 
05:53:00.670 --> 05:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
train going forward spins these things
 
05:53:04.350 --> 05:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
this is visual yes and as you drive up
 
05:53:07.468 --> 05:53:07.478 align:start position:0%
to the airport the Mustang left a rusty
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
tractor oh there piles of
 
05:53:15.150 --> 05:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
hey fence lines
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
art somebody paid money they've got a
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
Mustang out there too with like blue
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
illuminated eyes this yeah this is what
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
passes so to a good point um Adele can
 
05:53:29.548 --> 05:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
can you remind us how um how we select
 
05:53:32.190 --> 05:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
the artist for per for our what is our
 
05:53:34.708 --> 05:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
role don't we involv the local community
 
05:53:36.510 --> 05:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
and it it's a matter of committee
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
usually the developer certainly the
 
05:53:41.150 --> 05:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
architect for the program city planner
 
05:53:43.350 --> 05:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
if they choose to as well as uh
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
invitations to local community members
 
05:53:47.110 --> 05:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
to contribute to what they feel is
 
05:53:49.350 --> 05:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
reflective of their community and where
 
05:53:52.948 --> 05:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:52.958 --> 05:53:54.708 align:start position:0%
 
placed

05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
placed
 
05:53:59.270 --> 05:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
money remember Logan some of the floors
 
05:54:08.868 --> 05:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:11.468 --> 05:54:11.478 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll see what plans Ted kitchens
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
has later then if they have to do a
 
05:54:16.270 --> 05:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
renovation over there in
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester something to look at yeah
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully something to make you smile
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
you remembered right right
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'd like to get some new art
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
for our room down here I've been looking
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
at the same two ugly paintings for 12
 
05:54:32.150 --> 05:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
years you know you're going to probably
 
05:54:33.390 --> 05:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
have to talk to the State House
 
05:54:35.390 --> 05:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
committee about them but also we do have
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
an art bank that offers a rotation of
 
05:54:39.350 --> 05:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
five different pieces I looked at it
 
05:54:42.468 --> 05:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
once but I I didn't care for the eight
 
05:54:45.548 --> 05:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
choices or whatever were there anyways
 
05:54:47.430 --> 05:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:54:50.750 --> 05:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
this this this is strange because you're
 
05:54:53.670 --> 05:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
only got re Revenue to of the past five
 
05:54:56.350 --> 05:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
years I mean doesn't the state do more
 
05:54:59.230 --> 05:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
construction than that seems like we do
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
construction all the time right so not
 
05:55:03.750 --> 05:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily qualifying in that and they
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
may not need new pieces
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
depending on if there's existing ones
 
05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
because if if we are using something
 
05:55:13.190 --> 05:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
like that then we wouldn't need to
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
purchase or commission new works no no
 
05:55:18.670 --> 05:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
but just Revenue isn't the revenue
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
supposed to be half a percent of the
 
05:55:23.910 --> 05:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
first 15 million of of all construction
 
05:55:26.430 --> 05:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
of a new building of a new building I
 
05:55:27.868 --> 05:55:27.878 align:start position:0%
know I haven't thought about enforcing
 
05:55:30.948 --> 05:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
it sure interesting but we're building
 
05:55:32.430 --> 05:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
all the time aren't
 
05:55:35.430 --> 05:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
we you never know some cement inlays can
 
05:55:37.468 --> 05:55:37.478 align:start position:0%
always be possible
 
05:55:39.070 --> 05:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
I mean we got the new parking garage
 
05:55:43.788 --> 05:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
here right not yet what's that I was to
 
05:55:49.868 --> 05:55:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
million and is it the city or is it it's
 
05:55:55.788 --> 05:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
a major addition all right anyways go
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
um are the artists
 
05:56:06.990 --> 05:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
selected always new ham
 
05:56:12.030 --> 05:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
artists or does some of the art
 
05:56:15.070 --> 05:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
get commissioned or purchased from
 
05:56:17.628 --> 05:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
almost always New Hampshire but I can't
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
say exclusively particularly over the
 
05:56:21.788 --> 05:56:21.798 align:start position:0%
course of our history but that New
 
05:56:23.670 --> 05:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire artists are
 
05:56:26.788 --> 05:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
prioritized for these sorts of things
 
05:56:26.798 --> 05:56:31.110 align:start position:0%
prioritized for these sorts of things
thank

05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.910 --> 05:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
you so so you're regularly buying things
 
05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
but you're very rarely getting new money
 
05:56:39.190 --> 05:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
regularly B I'm sorry I didn't
 
05:56:41.628 --> 05:56:41.638 align:start position:0%
understand you're regularly spending out
 
05:56:43.270 --> 05:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
of this account
 
05:56:46.628 --> 05:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
but but you're rarely getting new I mean
 
05:56:48.430 --> 05:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
let's let's put it this way in the past
 
05:56:53.110 --> 05:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
five years you've um spent
 
05:56:56.150 --> 05:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
$75,000 more than you've
 
05:56:59.030 --> 05:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
gotten right or something like that more
 
05:56:59.040 --> 05:57:01.070 align:start position:0%
gotten right or something like that more
than

05:57:01.070 --> 05:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:57:06.350 --> 05:57:06.360 align:start position:0%
that cuz it started in 2020 at $244,000
 
05:57:10.150 --> 05:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:10.160 --> 05:57:12.190 align:start position:0%
 
105

05:57:12.190 --> 05:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
105
 
05:57:14.750 --> 05:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
building I there was in there's like
 
05:57:17.750 --> 05:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
municipal court buildings that might not
 
05:57:20.468 --> 05:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
be that expensive Hillsboro County yeah
 
05:57:22.708 --> 05:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
County court buildings um there was one
 
05:57:25.390 --> 05:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
in Milford recently yeah there was also
 
05:57:27.990 --> 05:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
the dam building oh the dam building
 
05:57:31.030 --> 05:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
that was also didn't
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
build yeah in which case we wouldn't do
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.788 --> 05:57:41.798 align:start position:0%
youth facility building is being paid
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
for with arpa
 
05:57:43.520 --> 05:57:45.070 align:start position:0%
for with arpa
funds

05:57:45.070 --> 05:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:57:47.390 --> 05:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't
 
05:57:51.150 --> 05:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
qualify because it's not part of capital
 
05:57:54.310 --> 05:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
budget there is a former art percent for
 
05:57:56.590 --> 05:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
art piece in the sununu youth services
 
05:57:56.600 --> 05:57:59.628 align:start position:0%
art piece in the sununu youth services
Detention

05:57:59.628 --> 05:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:02.150 --> 05:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
Center Yeah by to answer a question
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
Senator by Statute that the arpa funding
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible under this yeah
 
05:58:08.590 --> 05:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
this is strictly
 
05:58:10.670 --> 05:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
capital state
 
05:58:14.110 --> 05:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
funding yeah but most of House Bill 25
 
05:58:18.510 --> 05:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
you would think this would be part
 
05:58:22.510 --> 05:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
of no do local schools
 
05:58:25.468 --> 05:58:25.478 align:start position:0%
qualify no no no it's the city level or
 
05:58:28.230 --> 05:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
local state government you know like
 
05:58:31.430 --> 05:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmith has their own percent for art
 
05:58:36.548 --> 05:58:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
all right well I'm going
 
05:58:44.110 --> 05:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
to I'll ask um the comproller about
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
why why these revenue is is so
 
05:58:51.788 --> 05:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
low are you allowed to yes you've got
 
05:58:54.590 --> 05:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
repairs to pieces of art owned by the
 
05:58:57.628 --> 05:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
state and there's a lot of work just in
 
05:59:00.390 --> 05:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the State House been going
 
05:59:03.030 --> 05:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
on uh spending
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
money on making the portraits look like
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
what they were when they
 
05:59:12.510 --> 05:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
started how many more do we have go
 
05:59:14.190 --> 05:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
through I want to leave by
 
05:59:16.590 --> 05:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
4:30 okay I think we're getting
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
close all right so this one no
 
05:59:22.510 --> 05:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
change right except I'm going to ask a
 
05:59:22.520 --> 05:59:24.390 align:start position:0%
change right except I'm going to ask a
question

05:59:24.390 --> 05:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:59:24.400 --> 05:59:25.990 align:start position:0%
question
elsewhere

05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
05:59:29.390 --> 05:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
all next
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
one okay so we have 190 and 240 left and
 
05:59:37.150 --> 05:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
oh and a couple more
 
05:59:42.110 --> 05:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
so 190 firefighter Auto Parts Etc very
 
05:59:42.120 --> 05:59:46.150 align:start position:0%
so 190 firefighter Auto Parts Etc very
interesting

05:59:46.150 --> 05:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
project got several for Connecticut
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
Lakes no just before Connecticut Lakes I
 
05:59:54.468 --> 05:59:54.478 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about 190 on page 20
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at Patrick and Brian
 
05:59:57.990 --> 05:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is Bear
 
06:00:04.030 --> 06:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
fund right so this is for the funding of
 
06:00:10.590 --> 06:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
firefighting tools and equipment for
 
06:00:10.600 --> 06:00:13.150 align:start position:0%
firefighting tools and equipment for
municipalities

06:00:13.150 --> 06:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
have relationship with Excuse me the
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
towns to supply them with tools
 
06:00:22.468 --> 06:00:22.478 align:start position:0%
firefighting goes also with the training
 
06:00:30.910 --> 06:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:33.590 --> 06:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
withs yeah so that's that's basically
 
06:00:37.430 --> 06:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.190 --> 06:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
funds if I may that the source of the
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
way that this account is on the source
 
06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
of funding is essentially
 
06:00:51.150 --> 06:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um so in other words we we
 
06:00:54.868 --> 06:00:54.878 align:start position:0%
carry this account for the purpose of
 
06:00:58.708 --> 06:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
allow of making available to
 
06:01:00.548 --> 06:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities the firefighting
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
equipment and other equipment they need
 
06:01:04.750 --> 06:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
they go ahead and purchase it or they go
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
ahead and take it we build them for it
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
and then they reimburse
 
06:01:10.240 --> 06:01:13.270 align:start position:0%
and then they reimburse
it

06:01:13.270 --> 06:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.868 --> 06:01:15.878 align:start position:0%
okay and you have it for sale at less
 
06:01:17.910 --> 06:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
than they can just go to the vendor for
 
06:01:22.110 --> 06:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:26.510 --> 06:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
them yeah and the negative balances are
 
06:01:31.430 --> 06:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
due to um selling things just before the
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
end of the year correct timing of
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
right but my my question is why can't
 
06:01:42.430 --> 06:01:42.440 align:start position:0%
they simply go to the vendor and get the
 
06:01:45.150 --> 06:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
equipment why is the state
 
06:01:45.160 --> 06:01:48.030 align:start position:0%
equipment why is the state
involed

06:01:48.030 --> 06:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
involed
 
06:01:51.310 --> 06:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
statutory um requirement it's somewhat
 
06:01:55.548 --> 06:01:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:06.750 --> 06:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:06.760 --> 06:02:08.788 align:start position:0%
 
us

06:02:08.788 --> 06:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
okay I mean do you bulk purchase these
 
06:02:14.670 --> 06:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
things and therefore get a better deal
 
06:02:16.948 --> 06:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know if they both
 
06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
purchased but um that is one of the
 
06:02:24.150 --> 06:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of our Bear Brook so we
 
06:02:26.230 --> 06:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
have a headquarters at Bear Brook State
 
06:02:31.350 --> 06:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
Park and uh our site manager there works
 
06:02:34.830 --> 06:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
with our buo chief of for fire
 
06:02:40.788 --> 06:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:46.270 --> 06:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
based I see okay all right any other
 
06:02:48.590 --> 06:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
questions no we're happy all right
 
06:02:48.600 --> 06:02:50.788 align:start position:0%
questions no we're happy all right
number

06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
number
 
06:02:50.798 --> 06:02:52.590 align:start position:0%
number
240

06:02:52.590 --> 06:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
240
 
06:02:57.788 --> 06:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
29 oh sorry did we do not do 219 219 220
 
06:03:00.830 --> 06:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
and 221 are all similar yeah all right
 
06:03:07.150 --> 06:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:09.788 --> 06:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
yes all all three of these are funds
 
06:03:12.150 --> 06:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
trust funds there is a principal
 
06:03:16.230 --> 06:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
balance um the balances have
 
06:03:19.230 --> 06:03:19.240 align:start position:0%
produced the Investments have produced a
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of earnings over over the years we
 
06:03:23.990 --> 06:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
were spending for quite a long time a
 
06:03:27.390 --> 06:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
very limited amount to not exceed the
 
06:03:30.190 --> 06:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
amount of what was being earned on the
 
06:03:33.830 --> 06:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
fund um that in in recent years in the
 
06:03:36.670 --> 06:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
last three or four years we've gone
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
ahead and leveraged the value of of the
 
06:03:41.830 --> 06:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
earnings that were accured over a long
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
period of time and we have spent down a
 
06:03:47.430 --> 06:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of that amount we
 
06:03:50.270 --> 06:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
cannot go below the principal balance
 
06:03:52.310 --> 06:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
for each of these funds all of which
 
06:03:54.868 --> 06:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
support stewardship of the Connecticut
 
06:03:57.150 --> 06:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
headquarters area um in their different
 
06:04:00.430 --> 06:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
capacities as described um but we're at
 
06:04:02.350 --> 06:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
a point where
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
we're we've spent a significant amount
 
06:04:06.190 --> 06:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
down to the principal B balances we
 
06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed those principal balances
 
06:04:11.628 --> 06:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
um and at this time probably we'll be
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
finished by the end of the year with
 
06:04:17.030 --> 06:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
most of the earnings that have been made
 
06:04:19.468 --> 06:04:19.478 align:start position:0%
available um in the hopes that over time
 
06:04:22.270 --> 06:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
they will continue to they will grow
 
06:04:24.030 --> 06:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
through the investment and be made
 
06:04:25.548 --> 06:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
available in the
 
06:04:27.868 --> 06:04:27.878 align:start position:0%
future but these Pages make it look like
 
06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
there is no balance why don't you sure
 
06:04:29.878 --> 06:04:30.910 align:start position:0%
there is no balance why don't you sure
beginning

06:04:30.910 --> 06:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
B well we don't
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
maintain I know and that's kind of
 
06:04:35.280 --> 06:04:37.350 align:start position:0%
maintain I know and that's kind of
confusing

06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
06:04:39.070 --> 06:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
the the way that they're maintained on
 
06:04:42.390 --> 06:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
the accounting books in in the state is
 
06:04:46.230 --> 06:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
essentially they only show what is what
 
06:04:49.070 --> 06:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
is spent and then what we draw from the
 
06:04:51.390 --> 06:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
fund to pay back those expenses so it
 
06:04:54.310 --> 06:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
essentially always looks like same in
 
06:04:56.310 --> 06:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
same out which is which is essentially
 
06:04:59.110 --> 06:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
what happens on the accounting books but
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
the trust fund statements themselves are
 
06:05:03.628 --> 06:05:03.638 align:start position:0%
not published as part of the state's
 
06:05:05.708 --> 06:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
accounting and therefore they're not
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
depicted in this document as such but I
 
06:05:11.310 --> 06:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
can provide for you information on the
 
06:05:13.910 --> 06:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund balances themselves showing
 
06:05:15.390 --> 06:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
the principal amount the additional
 
06:05:18.708 --> 06:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
amounts available and what is left to be
 
06:05:21.150 --> 06:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
spent you did in all your other trust
 
06:05:24.390 --> 06:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
funds you showed the value of the trust
 
06:05:26.030 --> 06:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
yeah in the in the the case of those
 
06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
trust well again we're not really
 
06:05:30.070 --> 06:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
depicting the value of the trust fund
 
06:05:32.270 --> 06:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
itself we're depicting the activity that
 
06:05:34.750 --> 06:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
is available for spending against what
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
is available
 
06:05:40.628 --> 06:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah the the many of the trust fund
 
06:05:42.708 --> 06:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
accounts that are that are shown in this
 
06:05:45.190 --> 06:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
document do not actually show the
 
06:05:47.350 --> 06:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
principal balance that is that is being
 
06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
used fundamentally to fund what you're
 
06:05:49.840 --> 06:05:51.628 align:start position:0%
used fundamentally to fund what you're
seeing

06:05:51.628 --> 06:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
06:05:54.468 --> 06:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
here yeah we we'd like these pages to be
 
06:05:57.628 --> 06:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
more complete what I'm hearing is that
 
06:06:01.390 --> 06:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
some other accounting system is holding
 
06:06:03.510 --> 06:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
the balance of the fund and they're
 
06:06:05.830 --> 06:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
transferring to you at the appropriate
 
06:06:08.590 --> 06:06:08.600 align:start position:0%
time the interest the state treasury
 
06:06:10.990 --> 06:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
maintains the funds which is consistent
 
06:06:14.310 --> 06:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.320 --> 06:06:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
things

06:06:16.390 --> 06:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
06:06:19.430 --> 06:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so yeah please make these
 
06:06:21.788 --> 06:06:21.798 align:start position:0%
more complete or give get us the other
 
06:06:25.468 --> 06:06:25.478 align:start position:0%
information so we'll leave these
 
06:06:28.990 --> 06:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
open yeah okay representative Jan um I
 
06:06:32.830 --> 06:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
guess yeah I'm I just have a question
 
06:06:35.628 --> 06:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
about the fact that I understand you can
 
06:06:38.910 --> 06:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
only spend as much as comes in but for
 
06:06:42.270 --> 06:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
example in the last year 5600 came in
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
5600 got
 
06:06:47.910 --> 06:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
expended I mean is that no we we're not
 
06:06:49.590 --> 06:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're not limited to spending these
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
particular trust funds we're not limited
 
06:06:55.230 --> 06:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
to spending only what has been earned on
 
06:06:55.240 --> 06:06:56.350 align:start position:0%
to spending only what has been earned on
the

06:06:56.350 --> 06:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:06:58.708 --> 06:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
funds for a period of time we were
 
06:07:01.590 --> 06:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
limiting ourselves to that um but in the
 
06:07:04.190 --> 06:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
last few years we have actually been
 
06:07:05.750 --> 06:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
spending more than what has has been
 
06:07:07.350 --> 06:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
earned on them because that those
 
06:07:09.070 --> 06:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
earnings were accumulated over a long
 
06:07:10.750 --> 06:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
period of time and are available for us
 
06:07:14.788 --> 06:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
to spend we have found a need to invest
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
fairly heavily in a lot of the uh
 
06:07:19.708 --> 06:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs that support the
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut headquarters area and so
 
06:07:23.390 --> 06:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
therefore we are leveraging that
 
06:07:26.510 --> 06:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
accumulated balance that has been built
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
over many years that's why you see a
 
06:07:30.270 --> 06:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
higher spending than so so in this case
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
where you only spent 5600 that's all you
 
06:07:33.708 --> 06:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
really needed there's other money that
 
06:07:35.910 --> 06:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
you could have pulled in you need to
 
06:07:38.430 --> 06:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
spend more what I'd like to do is is
 
06:07:40.468 --> 06:07:40.478 align:start position:0%
postpone the discussion of these three
 
06:07:43.190 --> 06:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
until we have complete information and
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
then at our next meeting and ask them to
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
come back okay can we do that can I just
 
06:07:52.708 --> 06:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
represent one governance question
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
endowments generally have uh a different
 
06:07:58.868 --> 06:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
group in the background who gave the
 
06:08:01.350 --> 06:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
endowment and is monitoring
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
it is that happening or in this case the
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
the endowments were established by
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
someone a giver and we are responsible
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
for um the treasury the state treasury
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
is respon responsible for the
 
06:08:19.708 --> 06:08:19.718 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the fund of of the fund
 
06:08:22.468 --> 06:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
itself we are the recipients of
 
06:08:25.190 --> 06:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
the the money generated by the fund and
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
are able to use that so what you what we
 
06:08:30.310 --> 06:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
depict is what we use how much we spend
 
06:08:32.788 --> 06:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
and how much we
 
06:08:36.390 --> 06:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
draw um but this does not contain
 
06:08:40.230 --> 06:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
a full picture of the endowments
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
themselves and we can get that from the
 
06:08:43.510 --> 06:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
treasury we can get that from the
 
06:08:45.350 --> 06:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
treasury yes I can provide that for you
 
06:08:47.110 --> 06:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
and you'll also know where the money
 
06:08:50.548 --> 06:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
came from in the in the first place yes
 
06:08:52.708 --> 06:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
we have the historical documents that
 
06:08:54.350 --> 06:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
are the writeups that establish these
 
06:08:57.468 --> 06:08:57.478 align:start position:0%
endowments yes okay all right good let's
 
06:09:00.310 --> 06:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
go on to number
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh native
 
06:09:12.910 --> 06:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
plants natural heritage
 
06:09:15.868 --> 06:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
fund yeah so This falls under the
 
06:09:18.948 --> 06:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
division of forest and lands the um
 
06:09:20.830 --> 06:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
natural heritage
 
06:09:25.350 --> 06:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh is responsible for um
 
06:09:27.590 --> 06:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
documenting uh rare threatened or
 
06:09:30.150 --> 06:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
endangered species in the state it's
 
06:09:32.788 --> 06:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
under the uh Native New Hampshire uh
 
06:09:36.430 --> 06:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
Native Plant law and the revenue funds
 
06:09:39.070 --> 06:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
that come into this account
 
06:09:41.868 --> 06:09:41.878 align:start position:0%
are largely Chris correct me if I'm
 
06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
wrong but they're largely from the data
 
06:09:47.830 --> 06:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
check requests um basically every time
 
06:09:50.990 --> 06:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
someone contacts um it actually goes
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
it's a through a partnership with the
 
06:09:54.868 --> 06:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
06:09:57.390 --> 06:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
when someone's doing a project either a
 
06:10:00.868 --> 06:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
development or a forestry project they
 
06:10:04.150 --> 06:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
put a request in for a data check which
 
06:10:07.510 --> 06:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
our staff manages the database and it's
 
06:10:09.750 --> 06:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
a if there's a hit in other words if
 
06:10:12.070 --> 06:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's a a rare threatened or
 
06:10:15.030 --> 06:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
endangered plant or animal and the
 
06:10:19.070 --> 06:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
animals are the those the animals it
 
06:10:21.510 --> 06:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's data that's kept by fish and game
 
06:10:23.830 --> 06:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
but they sent it to us we manage the
 
06:10:27.030 --> 06:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
same data for them if there is a hit if
 
06:10:30.270 --> 06:10:30.280 align:start position:0%
there is a plant or an animal of concern
 
06:10:32.910 --> 06:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
then then a fee is charged actually and
 
06:10:35.948 --> 06:10:35.958 align:start position:0%
and there's a recommendations to how the
 
06:10:38.590 --> 06:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
applicant should address the the um
 
06:10:40.948 --> 06:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
presence of that plant or
 
06:10:40.958 --> 06:10:42.590 align:start position:0%
presence of that plant or
animal

06:10:42.590 --> 06:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
animal
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
um so we have a full-time staff person a
 
06:10:49.628 --> 06:10:49.638 align:start position:0%
data check environmental reviewer that
 
06:10:53.788 --> 06:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
inquiries and a portion of her salary is
 
06:11:00.390 --> 06:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
covered by these um these
 
06:11:02.390 --> 06:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
revenues and I'd like to just add that
 
06:11:04.670 --> 06:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to modernize this um whole
 
06:11:06.590 --> 06:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
process as much as possible so that
 
06:11:08.310 --> 06:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're not receiving paper money in the
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
mail um and we're working with Dees with
 
06:11:14.670 --> 06:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
some help from arpa funds to improve our
 
06:11:17.548 --> 06:11:17.558 align:start position:0%
online transaction ability um which is
 
06:11:20.750 --> 06:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
also just good business for developers
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
and folks that um that don't want to
 
06:11:26.150 --> 06:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
send a check in the mail um and so and
 
06:11:29.270 --> 06:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
so with that conversation with Dees
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
about how do we set ourselves up for the
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
future um we are also talking about um
 
06:11:38.788 --> 06:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
real aligning the fees um uh just to be
 
06:11:41.070 --> 06:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
more appropriate with the current market
 
06:11:44.030 --> 06:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:44.040 --> 06:11:46.350 align:start position:0%
 
outdated

06:11:46.350 --> 06:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
outdated
 
06:11:49.070 --> 06:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wy you got a
 
06:11:51.350 --> 06:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
06:11:57.948 --> 06:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
um I there the data checks on
 
06:12:00.708 --> 06:12:00.718 align:start position:0%
produce because they're rare plants and
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
you don't want people to uh go and
 
06:12:08.590 --> 06:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
trample on them um or take them on they
 
06:12:10.670 --> 06:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes there will be one little
 
06:12:15.030 --> 06:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
cluster of plants in a three diameter
 
06:12:19.548 --> 06:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
circle mile diameter circle and um
 
06:12:22.510 --> 06:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
you're towards the edge of that Circle
 
06:12:26.548 --> 06:12:26.558 align:start position:0%
and so we then speaking for conservation
 
06:12:28.788 --> 06:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
commissions we we then have to get the
 
06:12:32.350 --> 06:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
developer to go back and and check it
 
06:12:34.510 --> 06:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
out and bring us how many plants there
 
06:12:36.990 --> 06:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
are next to that
 
06:12:41.150 --> 06:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
area so I don't know and even the longed
 
06:12:45.070 --> 06:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
bat which we always get and which we
 
06:12:46.310 --> 06:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
have never
 
06:12:53.190 --> 06:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
seen is is um on our show up when
 
06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's a data check so I don't know if
 
06:12:57.628 --> 06:12:57.638 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state has that same
 
06:13:01.270 --> 06:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
thing but but um it is a very wide
 
06:13:03.670 --> 06:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
Circle and so practically all developers
 
06:13:06.548 --> 06:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
are going to end up paying some kind of
 
06:13:09.070 --> 06:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
f yeah
 
06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
so in every circumstance that I've
 
06:13:15.030 --> 06:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
witnessed um the staff is trying really
 
06:13:17.390 --> 06:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
hard to work with the developer to come
 
06:13:20.310 --> 06:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
up with a solution and it's not we don't
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
have any legal Authority we don't our
 
06:13:25.590 --> 06:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
staff person doesn't have a badge um but
 
06:13:26.948 --> 06:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh in most
 
06:13:29.548 --> 06:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
cases I think the
 
06:13:32.548 --> 06:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
conversations um produce a a good
 
06:13:36.510 --> 06:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
solution um because we don't want to be
 
06:13:40.548 --> 06:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
um unreasonable in you know as a state
 
06:13:42.150 --> 06:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
um but it's also really good to have
 
06:13:44.310 --> 06:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
that awareness um so that there are some
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
decisions you can make to to prevent a
 
06:13:49.390 --> 06:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
loss of a specific plant or animal um
 
06:13:51.430 --> 06:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
but we really use it as a conversation
 
06:13:53.270 --> 06:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
starter so if you're having a bad
 
06:13:55.830 --> 06:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
experience please let me know because um
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
our our whole um customer service um
 
06:14:01.310 --> 06:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
goals are to make sure that we're
 
06:14:03.830 --> 06:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
working in concert with a developer and
 
06:14:05.750 --> 06:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
not um
 
06:14:07.830 --> 06:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
constructionist my Conservation
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
Commission is all in favor of more rigor
 
06:14:14.230 --> 06:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
than you're actually using but it does
 
06:14:18.270 --> 06:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
make it longer and harder so on some in
 
06:14:21.390 --> 06:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
some cases particularly when you've
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
strawberries so since this fund has
 
06:14:32.350 --> 06:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
essentially zero balance you're you're
 
06:14:35.430 --> 06:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
spending whatever comes in is is there
 
06:14:37.150 --> 06:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
is there a point in having this instead
 
06:14:39.190 --> 06:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
of just having an accounting unit in
 
06:14:39.200 --> 06:14:43.350 align:start position:0%
of just having an accounting unit in
your

06:14:43.350 --> 06:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:46.750 --> 06:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
agency Excuse me yes so yeah this this
 
06:14:48.830 --> 06:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
account accumulates again the the data
 
06:14:51.070 --> 06:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
check fees that come in and the other
 
06:14:53.868 --> 06:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
fees um we have been experiencing uh
 
06:14:55.868 --> 06:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
maximizing every dollar going into that
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
account um we do have a person employed
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
um in fact we've actually been uh there
 
06:15:04.030 --> 06:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
is some portion of their cost is also
 
06:15:06.150 --> 06:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
subsidized by by federal money that that
 
06:15:08.990 --> 06:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
helps to pay for that as well
 
06:15:12.390 --> 06:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
um whether or not there's any wisdom to
 
06:15:14.310 --> 06:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
Exterminating this dedicated fund
 
06:15:18.430 --> 06:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
account and diverting to a more
 
06:15:20.150 --> 06:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
centralized natural heritage Bureau
 
06:15:21.590 --> 06:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
account I think that would be something
 
06:15:23.190 --> 06:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
I'd want to discuss with director
 
06:15:25.150 --> 06:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
Hackley and maybe understand a little
 
06:15:26.868 --> 06:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
bit better what the implication of
 
06:15:31.830 --> 06:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
be yeah think about that and also
 
06:15:37.628 --> 06:15:37.638 align:start position:0%
it looks as though because you're not
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
accumulating anything here that your
 
06:15:42.190 --> 06:15:42.200 align:start position:0%
expenses are greater than your the fee
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
income are yes we've reached a we've
 
06:15:48.030 --> 06:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
kind of crossed the line where the costs
 
06:15:50.590 --> 06:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
have actually begun to exceed The
 
06:15:52.468 --> 06:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
Collection which is again I think why
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners mentioned there is
 
06:15:56.350 --> 06:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a need to raise fees which
 
06:15:59.468 --> 06:15:59.478 align:start position:0%
are again are far outdated um so in the
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
meantime uh there is um help the federal
 
06:16:05.628 --> 06:16:05.638 align:start position:0%
grants okay yeah all all
 
06:16:10.390 --> 06:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
right represent is there any dat Data
 
06:16:12.910 --> 06:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
Bank other than the state Data Bank that
 
06:16:15.590 --> 06:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
would provide the information at the
 
06:16:19.350 --> 06:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
level it needs to be provided by Statute
 
06:16:20.590 --> 06:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure of that I would
 
06:16:22.788 --> 06:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
defer that uh question to director
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
Hackley yeah I I don't I don't know
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
exactly but I what I do know is that we
 
06:16:32.750 --> 06:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
contract with a uh National if not
 
06:16:35.190 --> 06:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
International uh organization called
 
06:16:35.200 --> 06:16:36.150 align:start position:0%
International uh organization called
nature

06:16:36.150 --> 06:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
nature
 
06:16:38.430 --> 06:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
serve and they have an extensive
 
06:16:43.350 --> 06:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
database that's um managed you know very
 
06:16:46.430 --> 06:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
rigorously and uh we pay them a fee each
 
06:16:49.230 --> 06:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
year we enter we provide them with data
 
06:16:51.270 --> 06:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
but they also kick back data to us so
 
06:16:53.910 --> 06:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a data sharing
 
06:16:57.788 --> 06:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
relationship but they are you know this
 
06:17:00.468 --> 06:17:00.478 align:start position:0%
is a these are highly trained ecologists
 
06:17:02.070 --> 06:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
and botanists that are on the other end
 
06:17:04.510 --> 06:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
of the the phone and on the other end of
 
06:17:04.520 --> 06:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
of the the phone and on the other end of
email

06:17:05.510 --> 06:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
email
 
06:17:08.150 --> 06:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
um speaking with our staff almost daily
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
so I feel pretty confident we probably
 
06:17:12.310 --> 06:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
have the most extensive connection to a
 
06:17:16.390 --> 06:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
want okay all right our next one is
 
06:17:23.150 --> 06:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
historic sites there are only two left
 
06:17:26.110 --> 06:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
so number 290 starts at the bottom of
 
06:17:26.120 --> 06:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
so number 290 starts at the bottom of
page

06:17:27.510 --> 06:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:17:30.990 --> 06:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
28 um so this one
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
has modest Revenue but essentially very
 
06:17:42.868 --> 06:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
expenses so the um historic sites is a
 
06:17:48.750 --> 06:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
is a bureau with under the division of
 
06:17:50.990 --> 06:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
Parks and Recreation uh this is like the
 
06:17:52.548 --> 06:17:52.558 align:start position:0%
Wentworth coolage
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
Mansion uh nansen uh ski jump uh weeks
 
06:18:00.548 --> 06:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
weeks uh State Park um Frost Farm
 
06:18:03.390 --> 06:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
facilities like that uh that we uh that
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
that we manage the the intent for this
 
06:18:10.110 --> 06:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
was set up is the um um to help um
 
06:18:13.310 --> 06:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
isolate revenues that come in through
 
06:18:17.788 --> 06:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
those facilities to stay dedicated to um
 
06:18:20.190 --> 06:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
reserved for specifically for historic
 
06:18:22.350 --> 06:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
sites so that they don't kind of get all
 
06:18:25.430 --> 06:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
consumed within the greater Park fund um
 
06:18:29.110 --> 06:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
and utilized for for for other sources
 
06:18:31.350 --> 06:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh so that was that was the really the
 
06:18:33.590 --> 06:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the reason that it was established
 
06:18:36.030 --> 06:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
and um as you said you the the revenues
 
06:18:38.310 --> 06:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
that come in are for tours and and
 
06:18:40.030 --> 06:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
missions through those
 
06:18:44.350 --> 06:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
facilities um and um our operating
 
06:18:46.430 --> 06:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
budget for that is is is sort of
 
06:18:49.270 --> 06:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
separate to um where these these
 
06:18:52.110 --> 06:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming in so are you
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
planning are you trying to build up
 
06:18:55.708 --> 06:18:55.718 align:start position:0%
because you're planning some kind of
 
06:18:55.718 --> 06:18:59.468 align:start position:0%
because you're planning some kind of
project

06:18:59.468 --> 06:18:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:03.708 --> 06:19:03.718 align:start position:0%
or because you've gone from from 46 to
 
06:19:06.350 --> 06:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
100 over the years
 
06:19:09.190 --> 06:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
here I think that might show a a growing
 
06:19:11.070 --> 06:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
interest in visiting our state historic
 
06:19:14.150 --> 06:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
sites this fund is never going to supply
 
06:19:17.590 --> 06:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
enough money to do all of the work
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to replace you know uh really
 
06:19:25.868 --> 06:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
fragile wallpaper um but I do think that
 
06:19:28.030 --> 06:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to double down on
 
06:19:30.390 --> 06:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
this fund and to figure out some better
 
06:19:32.230 --> 06:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue generating opportunities within
 
06:19:34.430 --> 06:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
the historic sites themselves as Brian
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
said it was established so that they
 
06:19:37.750 --> 06:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
don't get lost in the shuffle when we
 
06:19:37.760 --> 06:19:38.788 align:start position:0%
don't get lost in the shuffle when we
are

06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:19:41.510 --> 06:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
prioritizing uh you know our resources
 
06:19:43.030 --> 06:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to need life you know
 
06:19:46.270 --> 06:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
life-saving resources bathrooms Etc and
 
06:19:48.430 --> 06:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
these would just drop to the bottom so
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
long story short is I would you know
 
06:19:53.468 --> 06:19:53.478 align:start position:0%
we're always brainstorming and trying to
 
06:19:57.030 --> 06:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
figure out uh ways to uh grow support
 
06:19:58.750 --> 06:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
for these historic sites because they're
 
06:20:00.788 --> 06:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
always going to need a little extra
 
06:20:03.070 --> 06:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
attention um
 
06:20:05.590 --> 06:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
06:20:07.390 --> 06:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
this is okay but I think we have room to
 
06:20:10.670 --> 06:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
grow this account but if you have so
 
06:20:12.190 --> 06:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
many sites there must be more
 
06:20:14.548 --> 06:20:14.558 align:start position:0%
maintenance money somewhere else right I
 
06:20:17.590 --> 06:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
mean this is you've only spent $2,000
 
06:20:19.150 --> 06:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
over the last three years that's not
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
enough that's not enough um no we get
 
06:20:24.948 --> 06:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
support through the state parks through
 
06:20:28.030 --> 06:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
um con the Moose plate we we're allowed
 
06:20:29.708 --> 06:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
to use some of that money to help with
 
06:20:32.150 --> 06:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
that um Brian did you want to add and
 
06:20:34.830 --> 06:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
well are there's a um a general ener
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation which is unique to
 
06:20:39.708 --> 06:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
the state parks uh around
 
06:20:42.948 --> 06:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
$400,000 to support uh primarily the
 
06:20:46.190 --> 06:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
staff um of of the historic Bureau so we
 
06:20:49.590 --> 06:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
have two uh staff uh in conquered uh in
 
06:20:52.030 --> 06:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
headquarters that U facilitate and hire
 
06:20:54.590 --> 06:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
train and supervise the the seasonal
 
06:20:57.270 --> 06:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
staff who are the interpreters and um
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
guides um at and maintainers of these
 
06:21:03.670 --> 06:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
other resources okay so this is more for
 
06:21:03.680 --> 06:21:05.548 align:start position:0%
other resources okay so this is more for
occasional

06:21:05.548 --> 06:21:05.558 align:start position:0%
occasional
 
06:21:09.390 --> 06:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
special expenses or something yeah so um
 
06:21:13.030 --> 06:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'm guilty of creating this fund um so
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh back when the Bureau of historic
 
06:21:18.590 --> 06:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
sites was created um it was taken away
 
06:21:21.830 --> 06:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
from Parks the uh the division of parks
 
06:21:24.110 --> 06:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
as a standalone under the commissioner
 
06:21:29.110 --> 06:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
of dread and um Bob Odell Senator Odell
 
06:21:30.948 --> 06:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
former Senator Odell and myself
 
06:21:33.310 --> 06:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
recognized that there was no place to
 
06:21:36.070 --> 06:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
put any Revenue generated from events or
 
06:21:37.628 --> 06:21:37.638 align:start position:0%
donations or gifts and that sort of
 
06:21:41.390 --> 06:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
thing so so this so um this was to as it
 
06:21:42.910 --> 06:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
was mentioned earlier was to stop
 
06:21:46.190 --> 06:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
comingling of of um those funds with the
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
park fund um the um there was a general
 
06:21:53.628 --> 06:21:53.638 align:start position:0%
fund as as Brian uh just mentioned there
 
06:21:56.910 --> 06:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
was a general fund um appropriation set
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
up um when the bureau was
 
06:22:02.270 --> 06:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
created um and again under the
 
06:22:04.788 --> 06:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office and that did
 
06:22:07.750 --> 06:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
establish the administrative costs for
 
06:22:10.190 --> 06:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
the fund uh moose plate appropriation is
 
06:22:11.788 --> 06:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
usually around
 
06:22:14.510 --> 06:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
$250,000 that goes directly to historic
 
06:22:16.670 --> 06:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
sites as well as to maintain other
 
06:22:19.230 --> 06:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
historic resources within the park
 
06:22:22.628 --> 06:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
system um and um there's usually a
 
06:22:26.110 --> 06:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
capital uh request made um in the
 
06:22:28.708 --> 06:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
capital budget process uh by historic
 
06:22:30.628 --> 06:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
sites and that has been successful in
 
06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
the past um for various projects so
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
there is funding outside side of this
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
but as the commissioner noted um uh
 
06:22:42.788 --> 06:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
we've always tried to uh look for other
 
06:22:45.310 --> 06:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
ways to help fund and support those
 
06:22:47.708 --> 06:22:47.718 align:start position:0%
sites whether through it could be a a
 
06:22:50.830 --> 06:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
rental of a facility um say at week
 
06:22:54.548 --> 06:22:54.558 align:start position:0%
State Park or or some other uh program
 
06:22:56.788 --> 06:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh lecture program or events and that
 
06:22:59.350 --> 06:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so yeah I mean I see the
 
06:23:02.670 --> 06:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
use of having little bits of spare money
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
for you know the refriger Ator broke or
 
06:23:07.868 --> 06:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
something you know that and that happens
 
06:23:10.708 --> 06:23:10.718 align:start position:0%
frequently um yes a heating system or
 
06:23:14.230 --> 06:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
something like that absolutely okay all
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:23.948 --> 06:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:28.590 --> 06:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:33.150 --> 06:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:35.948 --> 06:23:35.958 align:start position:0%
resilience of
 
06:23:38.750 --> 06:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
Z Forest management oh
 
06:23:42.590 --> 06:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:44.708 --> 06:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
activity I don't know there's no there's
 
06:23:48.430 --> 06:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
no chart yeah so this one uh was created
 
06:23:50.468 --> 06:23:50.478 align:start position:0%
only a few years ago it has never
 
06:23:50.478 --> 06:23:52.590 align:start position:0%
only a few years ago it has never
actually

06:23:52.590 --> 06:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
06:23:55.830 --> 06:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
any okay it was
 
06:24:00.548 --> 06:24:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:03.670 --> 06:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
repeal where happened and I can think of
 
06:24:06.390 --> 06:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
one senator is probably going to scream
 
06:24:09.430 --> 06:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
oh well it's
 
06:24:12.190 --> 06:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
inactive yeah
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay well so it'll pass 23 to one what
 
06:24:15.520 --> 06:24:17.310 align:start position:0%
okay well so it'll pass 23 to one what
you're

06:24:17.310 --> 06:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
you're
 
06:24:21.150 --> 06:24:21.160 align:start position:0%
saying all right any other business
 
06:24:23.150 --> 06:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
before we adjourn you'll let us know
 
06:24:24.750 --> 06:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
when you'd like us back to talk about
 
06:24:27.510 --> 06:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut lat yeah how about
 
06:24:30.868 --> 06:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
um I was going to suggest uh the first
 
06:24:38.990 --> 06:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:40.270 --> 06:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
and obviously it doesn't have to be
 
06:24:43.270 --> 06:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
everybody right
 
06:24:47.868 --> 06:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
so uh October 2nd which is a
 
06:24:49.650 --> 06:24:49.660 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is that a
 
06:24:49.660 --> 06:24:50.910 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is that a
[Music]

06:24:50.910 --> 06:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:24:53.510 --> 06:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
possibility whatever works for you I
 
06:24:56.590 --> 06:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
think you probably need the and I don't
 
06:24:59.750 --> 06:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay I don't I don't know what's that
 
06:25:01.350 --> 06:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
you don't know it probably includes the
 
06:25:03.548 --> 06:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
clerk and I don't know because uh
 
06:25:06.510 --> 06:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday I lost my
 
06:25:08.510 --> 06:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
paper uh
 
06:25:12.868 --> 06:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
updator or my schedule your calendar yes
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
okay but I'm hoping to find it
 
06:25:19.468 --> 06:25:19.478 align:start position:0%
again so in general do you prefer
 
06:25:27.830 --> 06:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:27.840 --> 06:25:30.548 align:start position:0%

06:25:41.350 --> 06:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
11 well it should be fairly short we got
 
06:25:45.150 --> 06:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
three funds and then we'll just kind of
 
06:25:47.350 --> 06:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
have a list of we plan to do this this
 
06:25:51.910 --> 06:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
and this and talk it over kind yeah
 
06:25:53.990 --> 06:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
talking it over might take a little bit
 
06:25:56.708 --> 06:25:56.718 align:start position:0%
of time
 
06:25:58.788 --> 06:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
06:26:01.750 --> 06:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
