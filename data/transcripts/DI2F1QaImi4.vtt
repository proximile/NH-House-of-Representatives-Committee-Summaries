those those of you don't know me my name
 
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
is Tom Dolan
 
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh we do have a quorum
 
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
a quorum equals six of us
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
committee members and we we exceed that
 
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to miss
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
I already know Fred Doucette won't be
 
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't know about representative
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
walls if
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
if that spot would be filled but we're
 
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go
 
00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 align:start position:0%

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
to you today my name is Deborah Childs
 
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm the deputy chief of staff for
 
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
the house and I'm joined by my peers
 
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
other staff members who represent
 
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
different areas and Departments of the
 
00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
commission process can you hear me okay
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
so we're going to start off with the
 
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
charge of the committee and then the
 
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
staff is going to walk through the
 
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
commission process each of us will you
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
know walk through our process for our
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
area and then we're going to talk about
 
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
challenges and Improvement opportunities
 
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
Improvement opportunities that have
 
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
already been implemented things that are
 
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
in progress and then potentially some
 
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations that you can consider
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then we'll open it up to q a so if
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
we may we ask that you hold your
 
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
questions to the end unless it's a
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
clarification question otherwise if you
 
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
have a question just jot it down because
 
00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 align:start position:0%
we may answer it throughout the
 
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.130 align:start position:0%
we may answer it throughout the
presentation

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
then at the end next steps we have a
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
couple next steps that we'll talk about
 
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
what we're doing from a staff
 
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
perspective and then each one of you
 
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
will receive a binder we have a lot of
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
supporting documentation to some of the
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
points that we're going to bring up
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
today it's not my binder representative
 
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
patuchek but uh it's a binder with a lot
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
of documentation that will be helpful
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
including a draft list of all of these
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
so to start off
 
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
um just bear with me for a moment
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
because the next two slides I I am going
 
00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
to read it because it's very important
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
context for the whole presentation
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
the first is the problem statement you
 
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
can see up on the screen
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
over the past several decades there's
 
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
been an ever increasing number of
 
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
legislative committees commissions
 
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
boards councils task forces and working
 
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
groups in recent years more are created
 
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
each year than are repealed some are
 
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
duplicative covering overlapping subject
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
matter even overlapping in their
 
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
membership whereas others don't meet or
 
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
take any action at all
 
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
many have limited to no accountability
 
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 align:start position:0%
and therefore do not fulfill their
 
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements for appointments
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
deadlines reporting Etc
 
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's no consistent methodology when
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
new commissions are created and the
 
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
process for creating appointing managing
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
and maintaining them is complex and
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming for both
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
legislators and staff
 
00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
the sheer number of commissions alone
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
prevents legislators and staff from
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
making their way through the process in
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
a timely and efficient manner and it
 
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
takes them away from other work
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
including focusing on the commissions
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
there is hereby established a special
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
committee on commissions it shall be the
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
duty of the committee on commissions to
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
consider all matters pertaining to
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislative statutory committees
 
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
commissions subcommittees ad hoc boards
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
councils task forces and working groups
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
the committee is to review and evaluate
 
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:15.419 align:start position:0%
related processes and identify any
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
issues inconsistencies root causes and
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
possible solutions to make improvements
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
while also helping to decrease the
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
number of statutory commissions overall
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
and going forward
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
the committee can consider but not limit
 
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
themselves to considering the following
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
review commissions which could be
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
Consolidated or repealed review related
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
processes Administration and relevant
 
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
statutes including reporting
 
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.870 align:start position:0%
statutes including reporting
requirements

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
consider opportunities for
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
accountability and improving enforcement
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
improve the standards for writing
 
00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 align:start position:0%
legislation related to commissions
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
consider standardizing the process for
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
reviewing bills related to commissions
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
propose enabling legislation to enforce
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
these improvements
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
and help communicate knowledge and
 
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
improvements to colleagues and other
 
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.610 align:start position:0%
improvements to colleagues and other
stakeholders

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
so that's our problem statement and our
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee charge and we are honored to
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
have the speaker of the house with us
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
who's going to say a few additional
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
very few
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
this staff has done such a phenomenal
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
job putting this together that uh
 
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's not a heck of a lot I can add to
 
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
it except most of you know
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
how much I hate some of these things
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
and I think it's just as super waste of
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
time and I know representative evil has
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
been working on this for a long time
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
um we have too many
 
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
I think last last year we
 
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
got rid of 22 or 23 and we passed 60 new
 
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.629 align:start position:0%
got rid of 22 or 23 and we passed 60 new
ones

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
uh it it just it just keeps escalating
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make any sense and
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I know all of you make so much money
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
you just love to come up here for a
 
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
commission that doesn't do anything and
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
we have too many of those that don't do
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
anything don't meet we found one that
 
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
was in existence for a year and a half
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
and hadn't even have the members
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
appointed to it
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
and then we also found many that
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
especially on Health and Human Services
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
that overlapped
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
that could be combined into one
 
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.170 align:start position:0%
that could be combined into one
Commission

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:32.180 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
so our goal here is is
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically what uh Miss Childs pointed
 
00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:41.459 align:start position:0%
out to you is let's see if we can fix
 
00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:42.529 align:start position:0%
out to you is let's see if we can fix
this

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm confident that we can fix it so
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
we can have commissions that actually do
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
something and actually put forth a
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
report that means something and when it
 
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
comes to legislation if that's what's
 
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
requested of it we have something to go
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.170 align:start position:0%
forward with
um

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
I think you have a daunting task ahead
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
of you because there is so much that you
 
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
really need to look over and
 
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.690 align:start position:0%
really need to look over and
um but

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
um I would just ask that uh let's see if
 
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
help future legislators from going
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
through what we've had to go through for
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
with that I'll turn it back to the
 
00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
with that I'll turn it back to the
experts

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
all right so now we're going to get into
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
the presentation starting with the
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
commission process and each one of us
 
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
will go through introduce our introduce
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
ourselves the area that we work with and
 
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
warning uh my name is Jim CNC I'm house
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
legal counsel uh my piece of this
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
presentation is to give sort of an
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
overview of RSA 1449 which is the
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
statute which defines legislative study
 
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions I'll also
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about uh amendments to
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
that statute which occurred in 2022
 
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
which was sort of a first attempt to
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
curtail some of these things and then
 
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
also talk about a current bill which the
 
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
Senate has passed Senate Bill 84 which
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
is currently in the house which may make
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
further changes to the statute so I
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
think I'll start with talking about
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
um a very brief overview of 1449
 
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
um a very brief overview of 1449
um

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
you can think of it in terms of defining
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
three types of entities two of which
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
really aren't a problem but I'll talk
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
about them anyways uh the first are what
 
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
are called chaptered studies and these
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
are studies which exist only in chapter
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
law they are not codified in statute
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
which means that they're temporary they
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
are the membership is limited to
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
legislators only traditionally it's
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
usually three house four house members
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
one Senate member you can almost think
 
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:09.660 align:start position:0%
of them in terms of a subcommittee of a
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
house standing committee they exist only
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
for the biennium so if they're
 
00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
established in the first year of the
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
biennium they usually if they have
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline of that year they go
 
00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:22.019 align:start position:0%
away after that first year or at a
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
maximum they only exist for the full two
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
for the for the two years
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and the other important piece is
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
these are staffed by if they're a house
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
study they're staffed by house staff so
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
they're really not an issue because
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
they're very similar to what we are
 
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
already have within the outstanding
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
committees in terms of structure the
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
other type of committee which really
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
isn't an issue but I want to mention it
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
is and there's no real specific term
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
form I refer to them as regulatory
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
entities these are established by
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
Statute and they perform either an
 
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579 align:start position:0%
administrative or regulatory function
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
and they have a Perpetual term
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
and they're not established for study
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
purposes a couple of examples they could
 
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
be legislator only
 
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
um like the fiscal committee gel car is
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
another one there are about I want to
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
say 10 to 12 that are legislator only
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
and obviously those are staffed by the
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislature usually LBA or
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:25.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and then there's others that are I
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
use the Board of Medicine as an example
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
where their executive branch and their
 
00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
staff by the executive branch there may
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
be legislators on them but they're
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
really not a legislative study
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
and so they're really not an issue as
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
well and the other important thing is
 
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
these types of entities usually have
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
very specific rules of procedure because
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
they perform an administrative or
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
regulatory function so they're almost in
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
many ways like an executive branch
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
agency in that in that aspect
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
so what we're we're really talking about
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about study
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
commissions are everything else and
 
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
um in terms of definition their
 
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
statutory entities so they are
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
establishing statute for a purpose for
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
the purpose of studying a specific uh
 
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.290 align:start position:0%
the purpose of studying a specific uh
topic

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
um they may include a term and they may
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
not many of the ones that are currently
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
in statute never established a term I
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
think of the committee to study Exotic
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
Aquatic weeds is one of those it's been
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
Perpetual for over 20 years because
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
there was never a term established for
 
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.050 align:start position:0%
there was never a term established for
that

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
um these they do include legislators but
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
usually the majority of the membership
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
are non-legislators and that can include
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
the the chair of the committee and then
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
in terms of Staffing it's it's sort of a
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
hybrid some are staffed by the
 
00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
legislature some are not and you'll hear
 
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:52.260 align:start position:0%
later about some of the issues that that
 
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.930 align:start position:0%
later about some of the issues that that
presents

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
presents
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
um but and also in terms of where they
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
meet as well some meet
 
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:00.740 align:start position:0%
in in the State House complex some don't
 
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
and so they present a host of challenges
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
um due to their nature
 
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of of the 2022 amendments
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and representative evil obviously knows
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
this because she was a co-sponsor of the
 
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
this because she was a co-sponsor of the
bill

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
um it was an attempt to sort of further
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
Define these study commissions uh
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
provide uh you know more more structure
 
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
to them and so what what uh what the
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
Amendments did was it um first of all it
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
required the commission term to be
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
specified so you couldn't leave it it no
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
longer open-ended
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and then the statutory authorization
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
shall be repealed no later than five
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
years after the effective date unless it
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
was subsequently reauthorized by Statute
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
so in other words the most you could
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
have would be a five-year term unless
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
you came in later to reauthorize it
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the membership was limited to 15
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
members total and which could include
 
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
non-legislators but the legislative
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
members had to constitute a majority of
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
the commission and this was an attempt
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
to curtail some of uh there are some
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
study commissions out there with 20 plus
 
00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.170 align:start position:0%
study commissions out there with 20 plus
members

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
which may have included only one or two
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislative numbers so that specifically
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
addressed that issue and then also the
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh the legislator term legislative term
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
members on the commission also was
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
co-terminous with their term in office
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
because there are other issues that
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
where you had a member who was no longer
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
a member of the house or Senate who is
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
still on the body and the question was
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
were they still allowed to be on that
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
this sort of tightened that up to say
 
00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:34.019 align:start position:0%
that you know your term on the on this
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
study commission is coterminous with
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
your German office
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
um so and we're still sort of we've had
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
sort of offline discussions of how how
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
much effect these Amendments have had on
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
the new commissions moving forward
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's still sort of up in the air
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's there are attempts
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
we've heard to sort of go around the
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
requirements of the statute
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
um but we it's still sort of unclear in
 
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
the effect and it's only been in effect
 
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
for about a year anyways
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
um so the new development is Senate bill
 
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:05.820 align:start position:0%
84. um this started as a study
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
commission to study I believe is a
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
taxation issue and the Senate
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
um essentially uh amended the entire
 
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.509 align:start position:0%
um essentially uh amended the entire
Bill

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
and replaced it with a repeal and
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
reenactment of RSA 1449 and what it
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
would do is it would separate out the
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
two statutes so 1449 would only Define
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
chaptered studies and then it would
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
um enact a new RSA 1449-a relative to
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
study commissions so you'd have two
 
00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:39.259 align:start position:0%
separate statutes
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it takes the
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
15-member limit which was established
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
last year last year for study
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
commissions and then it would apply it
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
to the chaptered studies I'm not sure
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
the reason for that because chapter
 
00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
studies usually only have five members
 
00:16:59.569 --> 00:16:59.579 align:start position:0%
or so so that was for whatever reason
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
they took it out of the commission
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
portion and added it to the to the
 
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
chaptered study and so what it would do
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
for the legislative study commissions it
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
deletes that 15 member limit and also
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
the legislator majority provision as
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
well but it does add a a provision and
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
this is something that I talked with my
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
colleague in the senate about it would
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
require that all commissions shall be
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:17:30.289 --> 00:17:30.299 align:start position:0%
appropriate executive branch agency as
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
determined by the general court so
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
essentially what it would require is if
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
you establish a if the legislature were
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
to establish a study commission with
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
outside members it would all the
 
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
legislation would also have to specify
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
which executive branch agency would be
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for that in terms of hosting
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
it Staffing it uh and whatnot
 
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
um that bill did pass the Senate it is
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
now in possession of uh legislative
 
00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:57.419 align:start position:0%
Administration and um let's see how that
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
goes moving forward so that's really all
 
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
I have in terms of the overview on the
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
statute and we'll talk a little bit
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
later about some of the issues with the
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
statute but that's uh that's sort of
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Jim I'm Dave alaconis the
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
director of legislative services and uh
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
as you know we're kind of the first step
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
in the process of uh creating these
 
00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:24.299 align:start position:0%
things our members
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
come in and uh
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
and start the process usually it's by
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
it's almost entirely by email now which
 
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
is a bit of a
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
a problem and that we've moved to the
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
online and paperless because we have
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
less face-to-face interaction but that
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
is the nature of where we're moving in
 
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.140 align:start position:0%
in society with everything
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
but we don't have a while we don't have
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
a true checklist when we're forming
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
commissions it's kind of built into the
 
00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:57.380 align:start position:0%
system I don't want to get to inside a
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
baseball-ish regarding our legislative
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
management system the software that we
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
use that tracks a bill from beginning to
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
end uh but we have when we're drafting
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
in the in that system there macros so
 
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
certain boilerplate language does uh
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
does pop up we can choose it and that's
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
uh that's generally how how it works if
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
a request is duplicative we will try we
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
will talk to the requesting member uh
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
try to discourage or dissuade
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
however it's our experience that uh when
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
when our member of the legislature comes
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
in and requests us a commission
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
that comes in
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
at the jump at the very front end of it
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
and that they've got their mind made up
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
already so that can create problems
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
because sometimes it's not a boilerplate
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
you know we've heard about working
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
groups and task forces and names being
 
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
changed so that they're not commissions
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
but there are commissions uh and we get
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
names of organizations that are
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
requested to provide a member
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
that sometimes don't even exist their
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
their name of we don't
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
check to see if that organization really
 
00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:13.610 align:start position:0%
check to see if that organization really
exists

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's one thing if it's the Bia or
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
something that's a group that we all
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
know but there are a lot of very obscure
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
organizations that get uh membership on
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
on some of these commissions
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
and of course confidentiality uh
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
everything that is done at OLS until a
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced or until an amendment
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
is put on the table in one of the
 
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
committee rooms is uh confidential work
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
between uh OLS and the requesting member
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
so while the the requesting member May
 
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.130 align:start position:0%
so while the the requesting member May
uh

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
distribute it and talk about the
 
00:20:51.409 --> 00:20:51.419 align:start position:0%
proposal we really can't do that and we
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
never know when uh when something is put
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
on the table and I point out that we at
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
this time of year we're always being
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
asked for certain amendments and we
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't know when you as members put that
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment on the table where it's
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
offered so we can't even
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
we can't uh answer those requests to uh
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
to provide amendments uh
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't know what what stage of
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
the process it's in
 
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
now of this year and now this is these
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
numbers are a little over a week old but
 
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
there were somewhere around 45 bills uh
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
that have create
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
commissions or adjust commissions
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
and uh again the vast majority of those
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
3738 came in as an initial request of
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
the member when we were drafting back in
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
we have I believe seven that I counted
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
seven that were created via an amendment
 
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
uh during the process this year and I'm
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
not saying that these bills are that
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
they've gone forward or not uh I just
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
did a search of commissions and whether
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment uh or if it's in uh
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.409 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
there were a number of amendments
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
creating commissions just last week I
 
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
know that we we drafted so I don't know
 
00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:18.299 align:start position:0%
what they are but uh the number of them
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
were created that way
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
and that's our process from the from the
 
00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
beginning uh that it of course goes
 
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.510 align:start position:0%
beginning uh that it of course goes
through

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
the rest of the house in the Senate and
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
eventually back to us for enrolling and
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
sending up to the governor
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone uh Paul Smith
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
Clerk of the house
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
um again like Jim I'm just sort of going
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
to give you an overview of the clerk's
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
office process for now and then we'll
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
sort of talk about more of the
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty dirty details later
 
00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
so the clerk's office is responsible for
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
the review of all house bills and
 
00:23:01.669 --> 00:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
determining if there is a statutory
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
study committee or commission that has
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
been established by our bills this view
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
has historically been a combing through
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
of all the legislation as it becomes
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
chapter law because as Dave said
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
we often even though a bill might not
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
have been drafted as a committee or
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
commission it may have been turned into
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
one and this is something that we often
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
find that if if a sponsor doesn't feel
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
like he may or he or she may have the
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
votes then let's turn it into a study
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
and we can study it and then we can
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill in the second year but
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
I would also remind you that our house
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
rules do prohibit that that if a bill is
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
made subject of a study in the first
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
year it does have to require a rule
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
suspension or going through rules
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee to introduce separately and
 
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:52.460 align:start position:0%
that is that is something that has
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
historically been
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
sort of upsetting to some folks anyway
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so the painstaking process begins of
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
compiling the information while actively
 
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
identifying the appropriate contact
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
person or persons for the notification
 
00:24:08.409 --> 00:24:08.419 align:start position:0%
of their appointment
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
and as Dave said I do want to stress
 
00:24:12.529 --> 00:24:12.539 align:start position:0%
that this can sometimes be a difficult
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
task as members may have misidentified
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
organization during the Bill's drafting
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
or in some cases I.E in the naming of
 
00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:24.299 align:start position:0%
somebody like the Seabrook power plant
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
where a local designee could not readily
 
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:30.260 align:start position:0%
be appointed due to lack of information
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
fortunately a month or two after that
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist contacted us who
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
represented that organization and we
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
were able to finally work on who to
 
00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:42.049 align:start position:0%
were able to finally work on who to
identify

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
in some instances members who have
 
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
shepherded commissions through the law
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
making process may be over eager to have
 
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700 align:start position:0%
folks appointed before the law has even
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
been signed by the governor
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
our former member from stratum was
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
Notorious for that
 
00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:58.070 align:start position:0%
Notorious for that
um

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
so while the process of communication is
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
happening with external forces it's also
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
happening internally as well the
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
speaker's office the Senate president's
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
office and the governor's office are all
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
notified and in your binders later you
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
will see a notif a sample notification
 
00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
email that goes out from my office
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
so we create the committee or Commission
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
in our legislative management Suite that
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
powers all the data that's available on
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
the website we take the contact
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
information and are mindful of the term
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
length if stipulated and sort of
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
according to the position in which they
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
are numerated in the legislation
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
I often do hear from the first name
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
member inquiring if a quorum has yet to
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
be appointed if less than a quorum has
 
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:47.400 align:start position:0%
not been appointed it's not legal to
 
00:25:48.409 --> 00:25:48.419 align:start position:0%
call a meeting
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
if a quorum has been appointed the first
 
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
name member May schedule a meeting that
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
being said a quorum must be present to
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
make the meeting in any actions there at
 
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.070 align:start position:0%
make the meeting in any actions there at
legal

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
lastly pursuant to the changes made in
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 1449 last year the clerks of the
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
respective body shall then send a copy
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the report to the standing committee
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
of each body with jurisdiction over the
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:18.539 align:start position:0%
um I I would just mention too that that
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you do have bills that did
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
not start out as studies that have been
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
turned into studies and and those are
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
harder to keep track of
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
um but we do we have sort of identified
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about this a little more
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
later some of those internal workings to
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.529 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
all right the next part in the process
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
is the appointing authority chooses
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
appointees for each of the commissions
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
and again I'm Deborah I work for the
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house so the speaker has
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
to make appointments to the commissions
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
now I have my own spreadsheet and
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
um most appointing authorities have
 
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
their own spreadsheet which lists all of
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
the commissions and we search we sort
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
that by term end date because when a
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
term is ending we need to know the next
 
00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
appointment is due
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
no props
 
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.610 align:start position:0%
no props
[Laughter]

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
so these are all of the statutory
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
commissions as you can see in the in the
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
photo on the slide deck I have two other
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
binders because one of them is for other
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions like our our
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
policy committees committees created by
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
executive orders by the governor ad hocs
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
and all those these are statutory
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
committees alone
 
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:55.100 align:start position:0%
and so if if a new commission is created
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a separate
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
process and I and I have a binder to
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
keep those in so if we pass 65 in a year
 
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
they're not yet we don't yet have the
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
RSA and so I keep them in a separate
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
separate file but
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
um to be notified of a new commission I
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
can get this from various methods and
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
ways I may have one of the clerk's
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
office inform me that there's a new
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
commission I may have a member because
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
they have interest in the commission I
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
may hear it on the news that a new
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
commission was created so I work to
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
collect all those new commissions so the
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
speaker can make his appointments
 
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:32.820 align:start position:0%
then I review the RSA the RSA
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
specifically the um
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
commission requirements because lots of
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
times they have requirements you have to
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
appoint the speaker has to appoint maybe
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
two members who are or are on the
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee for example one
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
who's on C you know criminal justice
 
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
um perhaps one from the minority and one
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
from the majority so there's a lot of
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
specific requirements and that's why I
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
have my binder which I have my
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and then this supports that
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is all sorted by RSA so I can flip
 
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:03.419 align:start position:0%
to the RSA and make sure the speaker is
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
is well informed of what the
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
requirements are and then also in this
 
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
binder I have notes because lots of
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
times there's back and forth in this
 
00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
process I may have recommendations from
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
chairs or the speaker may ask that I
 
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
follow up with the member to make sure
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
they have interest expertise and the
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
capacity to be able to take on the
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
position it's not just we have 400
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
members so just to point someone it's
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
it's a process we want to make sure we
 
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:28.740 align:start position:0%
appoint the right people to each
 
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.889 align:start position:0%
appoint the right people to each
committee

00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
so then the speaker speaker makes the
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
decision and then I send out an
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
appointment notice and I update my
 
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.330 align:start position:0%
appointment notice and I update my
spreadsheet

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
other parts of the process that the
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
speaker's office follows is we approve
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
mileage for committee members to to go
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
to the state department you know the
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
particular State Department or to the
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
state house and then also
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
um generally at the end of the year the
 
00:29:53.570 --> 00:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
speaker receives a copy of uh the the
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
reports interim reports and final
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
reports that come out of these
 
00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
commissions and that presumably is is my
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
role here however I do receive a lot of
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
commission questions and then meeting
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
with every other department here we
 
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:10.140 align:start position:0%
receive a lot of the same questions
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of it is because of the you
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
know the sheer number and the you know
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
the confusion from the sheer numbers so
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
we receive a lot of the same questions
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
that takes up a lot of Staff time and
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
legislator time as well
 
00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much my process and moving
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm Ann Fitzgerald and I'm the director
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
of Health Community Services and it is
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
our office who supports these study
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
commissions administratively and also
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
with research staff and I have a lot to
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
say but I'll do it on the second round
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
the first round I'm just going to go
 
00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:49.490 align:start position:0%
the first round I'm just going to go
over

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
um our our process as everyone has been
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
doing just to give you a quick overview
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
so once the first named member
 
00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:00.539 align:start position:0%
um is named they will hopefully come to
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
us to schedule their organization
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
meeting but one of the things we have to
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
do is constantly monitor as
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan did this morning we
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
have to keep monitoring to see uh on the
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
web page if a um a quorum has been
 
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
achieved yet and that can take time and
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
some we've had some members who want us
 
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:19.980 align:start position:0%
to con to monitor it regularly but we
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff to do that so uh we
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
have to achieve that before we can
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
schedule their organizational meeting we
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
also have an instruction sheet that
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
explains to the first name what their
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
role is and what they need to do to make
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
that meeting happen and to move forward
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
what the chair needs to do the committee
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
assistants support these commissions
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
clerically we don't take minutes but we
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned scheduled the meetings
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
maintain the files and we type their
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
minutes for the myth they're handwritten
 
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
the researchers whose staff the
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
commissions uh usually or they monitor
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
them if they're staffed by an agency
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's usually wherever the bill
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
originated in the house whatever
 
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
committee that came out of the
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
researcher was assigned to that standing
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee usually takes on this study
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
commission as well
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and the chair is elected at the first
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
meeting again if the Quorum exists and
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
we start working with the chair after
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
that the chair will appoint a clerk
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
and then we also have we assist with uh
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
preparation the final report
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
um and we uh is distributed by the
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
administrative staff and we have final
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
report template as well as a letter of
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
transmittal we have samples of that in
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
the binder that you will be receiving
 
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.409 align:start position:0%
the binder that you will be receiving
later

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
um our staff has been Staffing these
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
since the 70s and we've worked very
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
closely with representative Ebel for the
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
last three three studies right last
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
three and so where we know what the
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
numbers are obviously and um
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
as Deborah's mentioned we get questions
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
that every other office gets as well and
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
members keep going from office to office
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
seeking advice because sometimes they
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the study to
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
begin with the one member proposed it
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
and a member accepts it and then they're
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
scrambling to try and find out how do I
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
make this happen so I can go into more
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
detail in our second round
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so now we're going
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
to move on to challenges and Improvement
 
00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
to move on to challenges and Improvement
opportunities

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
Paul and I are going to cover this
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
together because many of our issues tend
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
to overlap
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
um I guess the the first thing I really
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
want to point out with these in addition
 
00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:48.019 align:start position:0%
to everything you've heard so far is
 
00:33:48.019 --> 00:33:49.549 align:start position:0%
to everything you've heard so far is
these

00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
um these statutory study commissions
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
they're creatures of Statute and so in
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
there's a general lack of guidance and
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
accountability in the absence of any
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
specific statutory provision
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and you can contrast that with say a
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
chaptered study or a um or even a house
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
standing committee we have house rules
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
we have the speaker as the presiding
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
officer who has sort of General
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
administrative authority over the over
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
the body
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
um these you know if if the statute
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't specify something like say an
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
appointment term or how to replace a
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
member or remove a member there's really
 
00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:30.599 align:start position:0%
no guidance compared to say our our
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
house committees and so that presents
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
problems it gives rise to many of the
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
questions that Deborah gets that Paul
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
gets that we all get um and trying to
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
sort of sort out how to handle a
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
situation that arises
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and so so having said that the clear
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
the clearest guy guidance for these
 
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
groups is the the requirements of the
 
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
right to NOLA RSA 91a that's sort of the
 
00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:55.339 align:start position:0%
Bedrock of what they do have to follow
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
these are clearly public bodies because
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
they've been established by Statute and
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
so they have to meet uh the both
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of the law they have to
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
abide by open meetings requirements
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
which means that they have to notice
 
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:08.940 align:start position:0%
their meetings and they have to hold
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
them open from the public and then they
 
00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
also have to maintain public records
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
that is they have to keep minutes they
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
have to keep a file available for
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
inspection in case somebody wants to
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
view the materials and then they also
 
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
usually file a report
 
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.650 align:start position:0%
usually file a report
um

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
the problem is particularly with these
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
commissions that
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
um with the the chair is an outside
 
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
member and where there's not a clear
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
connection with the legislature they
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know that they have to
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
follow these rules
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
um and so the questions that arise tend
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
to come back through the legislator
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
who's maybe serving on one of these and
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
says oh well we heard we have to take
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
minutes now and which wouldn't be an
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
issue for say a house committee we know
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
we have to take minutes because it's in
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
our rules
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think that gives rise to
 
00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
um to many of the questions that we tend
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
to get and I know Paul's got some
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
specific examples on those
 
00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.099 align:start position:0%
so just to to Jim's point about a couple
 
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
of things so it is important that we do
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
we we yes this is a special committee on
 
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
commissions but we do need to talk about
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
the committees as well because they
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
really this whole statute is about
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions and and so
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
this really does speak across purposes
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
so in several instances over the past
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
couple years there have actually been uh
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
at least three bills where
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um part of the charge was to review the
 
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
rules of the House of Representatives to
 
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
identify what changes are required to
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
authorize certain things
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's important to note here in
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
just in in terms of the the lack of
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
guidance and accountability why would
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
you appoint a senator
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
to a house study about house rules
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's just there it reeks of
 
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
impropriety um I mean the Senate has a a
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
fundamental lack of rules where ours are
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
very specific about certain things and
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
they don't have a guiding
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
um a guiding secondary source like we
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
have Masons they don't have that so
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
again I I there are certain things here
 
00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500 align:start position:0%
that that we do have to consider
 
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.410 align:start position:0%
that that we do have to consider
additionally

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
want to go back a little bit during the
 
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
committee of conference process I have
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
to review all of the reports to see if
 
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions are appointed
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
in those reports that exceed the
 
00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
reporting deadlines established by our
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
own house rules and statute because in
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
those instances that requires a
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
two-thirds approval of the committee of
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
conference report because it is
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
tantamount to a rule suspension
 
00:37:41.099 --> 00:37:41.650 align:start position:0%
tantamount to a rule suspension
um

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:41.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
regarding a you know a question
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
regarding the change to 14 and 49
 
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
because this is a new change for this
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
year is requiring the chairs to get the
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
reports so the answer in some of those
 
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
instances is pretty easy to determine
 
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
because of where the bill may have come
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
from however
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is an issue I I cite an example
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
because I've been here a long time but
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
we've had over the years construction
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
and demolition debris and how it's and
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
how it's disposed of now in our our body
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
we have earth air and water
 
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
resources gets water environment gets
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
Earth and science gets air construction
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
and demolition debris has historically
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
gone to two committees environment and
 
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:32.820 align:start position:0%
science so in those instances who's
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
getting the reports are we giving them
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
both so those are some specifics that
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
that are are sort of coming up
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
um back to the legal issue again if less
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
than a quorum has not been appointed
 
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's not legal to have that meeting and
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
when we come to notice
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
where do we where do we need notice
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
specifically those commissions that are
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
created legislatively but have no
 
00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
legislative members because we have
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
several of those
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
um we don't take charge of them so in
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
terms of posting are we responsible at
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
all for keeping track of those things I
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
argue no
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
um and do we have to make sure that the
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the agencies are posting those
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
things on their own websites or keeping
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
track of minutes and those sorts of
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
things so to those first two points you
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
know regarding the right to know and the
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
lack of guidance those are those are
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
things where we are speaking across the
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I think the the other issue that I'd
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
add and a term at committee governance
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
issues and I sort of hinted at this
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
these are largely the issues that
 
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
the questions Deborah gets in terms of
 
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
appointment terms or reappointment or a
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee needs to reorganize and uh
 
00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
elect a new chair
 
00:39:49.859 --> 00:39:50.390 align:start position:0%
elect a new chair
um

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
again if the statute doesn't specify how
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
that is done it's really an open
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
question there's not a lot of guiding
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
law on this Beyond sort of general
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
principles of Law and so versus say our
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
standing committees or a chapter study
 
00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
or a strictly statutory regulatory
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
committee and so that's why in terms of
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 84
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know I think we could debate
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
the issue of potential administrative
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
attachment that would certainly clarify
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
it because it would take it out of our
 
00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:23.569 align:start position:0%
it because it would take it out of our
purview

00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
purview
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
um but at the same time it doesn't
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily resolve the underlying
 
00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:29.099 align:start position:0%
issues of governance if it's not
 
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:32.339 align:start position:0%
clarified in statute so I guess in in
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
terms of these commissions that from a
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
legal perspective that's my biggest
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
concern with these is that the lack of
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
the lack of legal guidance
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
um absent statutory author specification
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh additionally in in following up with
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
Jim here the
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
if a commission is created one
 
00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
suggestion regarding tying SBA 84's
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
language and cleaning this up because I
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
will tell you from my own perspective I
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
think that SB 84 doesn't quite get where
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be and I think that
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
it would my opinion is that it's best to
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
probably retain that this year in
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration so that it
 
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%
can be worked on for the fall but one of
 
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
those suggestions could be regarding the
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
contents of the commission's work that
 
00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:20.339 align:start position:0%
Jim's talking about and what the said
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
repository for that work should be and
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
and where it should be and and that sort
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
of thing that can all be clarified
 
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:28.310 align:start position:0%
of thing that can all be clarified
um

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
for those committees and commissions
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
that are existing past the term the
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about reorganization that Jim
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
brought up are very very much true
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
because what happens a lot of times is
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh say we've had a a commission that has
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
has been on the book since 1977 and has
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
met and it has been in absence during
 
00:41:52.849 --> 00:41:52.859 align:start position:0%
covid and they're coming back together
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
however in 19 or 2017 they did elect a
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
new chair and that chair appointed a
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
clerk and they just haven't met because
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
of covet or whatever the situation is
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
that if you get a new member of of the
 
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
house who has been appointed and that
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
member then says I'm calling this
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
commission meeting and we're going to
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
the first organizational meeting is to
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
elect a new chair but you have a chair
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
so these are questions legal questions
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
that are existing and I and I do think
 
00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:26.339 align:start position:0%
we do need to talk about that
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I I do
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
I do think
 
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
I do think
that

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
I think the Senate lacks an
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
understanding of the committee this the
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
committee process in the adoption of
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
their amendment to SB 84.
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the the change that they made of turning
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
a study committee a chaptered study
 
00:42:49.609 --> 00:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
committee into a 15-person committee
 
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
makes absolutely no sense especially
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
because the Senate always amends our
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
study committee bills to putting one of
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
them on and we often struggle to get
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
four or five house members
 
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
who want to be on a study so upping that
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
to 15 I think is is I think they were
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
trying to make the the switch from
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
commission but I that they clearly got
 
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
it wrong there
 
00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.510 align:start position:0%
it wrong there
um

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
the point of legislative committee
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
commissions being capped last session
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about was because of
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
the influence of those outside the
 
00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
general court driving policy versus the
 
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
members driving policy and and the
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental belief of of the house and
 
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate last term was that
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
legislators should be the ones focusing
 
00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.109 align:start position:0%
legislators should be the ones focusing
on

00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:43:41.089 --> 00:43:41.099 align:start position:0%
adopting legislation and driving the
 
00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:42.410 align:start position:0%
adopting legislation and driving the
policy

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that that's a very
 
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
real issue the one area of of SB 84 that
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think is right specifically is the
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment to the agency
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
however I do think that the individual
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:56.690 align:start position:0%
however I do think that the individual
bills

00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:56.700 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
should be drafted with which agency they
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
should be attached to so that the first
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
named member who is trying to call the
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
meeting is not calling around calling
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
around to an agency that can host versus
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
an agency that shall host
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
um and additionally I I do think there
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
is one additional point that we have to
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
talk about and that is
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen if we are now
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
appointing all these things and these
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
agencies say well this is going to cost
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
you some dough
 
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
because I will tell you uh we a few
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
years ago broke the mold with
 
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.670 align:start position:0%
years ago broke the mold with
commissions

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
we spent five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
on a commission now I I'm not going to
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
get into the details it's not it's not
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
my point but but the point is is that we
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
appropriated five hundred thousand
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
dollars to run a commission that was not
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
housed here
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that might become the norm if if we
 
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
sort of go back to the old model of
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
commissions and potentially consider
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
this so I I just mentioned that as a
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
point that it should be thought about
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
for what could happen
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
going into uh the system maintenance I I
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
do want to address this because this is
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
where I get a lot of calls
 
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
administratively the system when you go
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
on to our website and look up a
 
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner or committee
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
um it's sometimes static
 
00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
because commissions especially with
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
commissions that meet infrequently or
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
have never been Sunset that maybe should
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
uh specifically when Commissioners are
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
named for certain agencies as being
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
members uh
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
we might never hear back after the first
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
two years of a commission and
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners either have four or five
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
year terms and
 
00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
if if we don't get a notification that
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a change I there's not
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
enough time to have somebody live in the
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
statutory commission's page
 
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
and on on our staff either in committee
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
services or my staff that literally just
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
spends all their time looking and seeing
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
who's been updated in terms of of which
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
agency so that that is something
 
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.329 align:start position:0%
agency so that that is something
additionally

00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:46:17.339 --> 00:46:18.470 align:start position:0%
additionally
um

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
appointing authorities often send folks
 
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.670 align:start position:0%
appointing authorities often send folks
along

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
along
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
because their appointment isn't there
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that person doesn't get to vote that
 
00:46:31.849 --> 00:46:31.859 align:start position:0%
person is not a member of the commission
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
or the committee
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's important to know that that
 
00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
the named person is the person
 
00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:41.579 align:start position:0%
and we don't just have alternates
 
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes people like to throw
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
alternates at us but the fact of the
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
matter is if the statute says there are
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
alternates then there can be alternates
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
that doesn't fly and that and that
 
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
alternate doesn't just get to vote so
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
that is uh you can't just sub a player
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
for the day
 
00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:03.290 align:start position:0%
for the day
um

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
so lastly to to sort of conclude
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
um the passage of 1269 last session
 
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
helped a great deal in terms of
 
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees thank you to
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative evil and the staff that
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
was working so hard on that some further
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
modifications that we've already talked
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
about might make it stronger
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
um I think SB 84 and its current
 
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
iteration needs more work
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
uh additionally staff has already begun
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
to identify a few issues to help better
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
identify committees in Commissions in
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
their infancy
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
um culturally though and this is this is
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
this is where I'm gonna sort of throw
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
some salt culturally I'm not sure we can
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
change the perspective of some that
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
studying issues is already within the
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
purview of our standing committees
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
I want to say that again all of you are
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
on standing committees and every one of
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
your standing committees can study the
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
issues because every standing committee
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
has a description in house rules about
 
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
what that that committee can discuss and
 
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that you just have to
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
hear bills on those things you can have
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
ad hoc meetings you can have specific
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
subject matter discussions and even
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
bring about legislation so I I do think
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
that you remember that and that you
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
encourage members to talk with their
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
chairs about these issues
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
we we we just had a new special
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
Committee created today
 
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
to address uh issues going on in the
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
family court so there's a special
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
committee that's been formed just for
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
that purpose so I mean we have three
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
other special committees this year one
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
of which is yours that are are specific
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
to to serious issues so those those are
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
important Avenues as well
 
00:48:53.339 --> 00:48:55.790 align:start position:0%
important Avenues as well
um

00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if we can change that
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
culture but it would be good
 
00:49:00.119 --> 00:49:02.089 align:start position:0%
culture but it would be good
um

00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:02.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
I I would also just mention too that
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
that you know just because turning
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
something into a study committee or a
 
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.990 align:start position:0%
something into a study committee or a
commission

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
um might boost your your pass fail
 
00:49:13.849 --> 00:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
statistics and and getting uh uh which
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
legislation was signed into law and that
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I don't know if that
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
really is is the best use of of of our
 
00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.950 align:start position:0%
really is is the best use of of of our
resources

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.609 align:start position:0%
resources
um

00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
I know I and the rest of the staff are
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
here to assist you in this endeavor the
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
best we can but I also know that there
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
are sometimes political considerations
 
00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
as well that we are really we stay away
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
from uh a specific issue was uh earlier
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
last month there was a bill that was
 
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
being debated on the house floor to
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
create a study Commission
 
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
that was going to study the exact same
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
thing that's already being studied by
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
another commission
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it did sort of turn
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
into a political issue even though it
 
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
was about a commission that's already
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
studying a topic
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
um so again there is this this cultural
 
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
thing that we have to we have to think
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Paul
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
I touched on most of the challenges that
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
we have at OLS on my first part of my
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
the commission's uh do follow a certain
 
00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:35.180 align:start position:0%
process to through OLS we have to mainly
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
confidentiality with our members
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
deadlines are a concern for us sometimes
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough information
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
for a bill and uh it comes down to the
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
last minute and then the remember will
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
request a uh commission to be
 
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.770 align:start position:0%
request a uh commission to be
established

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
and again in the end we do what the
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
member asks us to do
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
now that being said uh internally we
 
00:51:06.370 --> 00:51:06.380 align:start position:0%
have made some changes at OLS already
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
largely to allow the clerk's offices
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
both the House and Senate to get
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
information earlier
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
we are working with it to be able to get
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
reports and information
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
shared easier amongst the different
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
Offices here in the legislature
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll continue to do that
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we are looking at
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
in OLS is to have more of a
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
Communications effort as we
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
start looking at filing period for next
 
00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:38.870 align:start position:0%
start looking at filing period for next
year

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh because that's on our planning table
 
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:45.059 align:start position:0%
right now of how we
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
taking some of the things from this year
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
and learning from them and moving
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
forward and one of that one part of that
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
will certainly be a discussion about
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
about commissions and the research
 
00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we that you have with
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
the OLS OLS has a four-member research
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
staff that can conduct research for any
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
individual member as house members you
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
know house committee services and
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
research provides research at a
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee level but at OLS we provide
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
that research for any member of the
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
House and Senate
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
and many times
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:28.980 align:start position:0%
the information that is in the end
 
00:52:32.089 --> 00:52:32.099 align:start position:0%
gleaned by a commission
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
could have been obtained just by coming
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
to OLS research and getting the
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
information beforehand and that would
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
that request had not been made so maybe
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
a better marketing effort uh for our
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
staff is well it maybe it is uh it is a
 
00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
better marketing effort that we will be
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh that we will be doing here as we move
 
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
forward and lastly notwithstanding we
 
00:52:59.530 --> 00:52:59.540 align:start position:0%
can make changes to 1449 to make it seem
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
lock solid but all we have to do is have
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
the members say insert notwithstanding
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
1449 and then that commission can be
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
anything the member requested to be with
 
00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
any number of appointees members rules
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
or not uh that's uh that's something to
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
keep in mind and that's uh that's an
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
easy way to uh to avoid some of the some
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
of the issues some of the uh safeguards
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
all right so moving on to the appointing
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
authority and I said previously that I
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
work for the speaker of the house but I
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
also consulted with the Senate and they
 
00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:47.579 align:start position:0%
follow a similar process and have
 
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
similar challenges so I'm also speaking
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
for the Senate when I when I speak today
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind there are a lot of
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
appointing authorities there may be
 
00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
non-profits the governor and various
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
State departments as well so they all
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
have their own process as well there's a
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people impacted by this
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
the biggest challenge for me is that
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
there is no one consistent list of
 
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.250 align:start position:0%
there is no one consistent list of
commissions

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
we all have our own spreadsheet or
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
however others track it one of those
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
reasons is I track all of the speaker's
 
00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
appointments so it's not just statutory
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
commissions but it's standing committees
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
any type of committee committees from
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
executive order from the governor even
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
for organizations like CSG and ncsl he
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
has those appointments as well so I
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
track those in my in my spreadsheet and
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
then I also track information that
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
others may not care about the clerk
 
00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
wouldn't care about or OLS or even house
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
committee services so that's why I have
 
00:54:48.049 --> 00:54:48.059 align:start position:0%
my own spreadsheet right now now the
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
stars on the on the slides as we've been
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
going through are areas where we have
 
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
made some improvements and we're looking
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
to make more improvements so this is one
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
big area where we're looking to share
 
00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
the data because that's one thing that's
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
next bullet and I I apologize for the
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
text Heavy slides here but I wanted to
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that all these issues were
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
documented so if you forget what I say
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
at the end you'll at least have them
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
bulleted for you
 
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:15.589 align:start position:0%
bulleted for you
um

00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
so next bullet is commissions may be
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
duplicative and I think all of us have
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
spoke to this a little bit they're
 
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
overlapping in subject matter and in
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
membership we have a a you know I want
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
to say a small number we have 400 house
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
members but there are very few that
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
actually serve on the commission so we
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
have some Representatives that serve on
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then when when it comes to the
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
Senate they only have 24 members to
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
choose from so it's a it's a struggle
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
from that end too
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
next bullet policy committee chairs may
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
lose Authority and insight on subject
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
matter and Clark Smith's talked about
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
this so this is opposed as opposed to a
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or ad hoc committee this
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
new commission is being created chairs
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
of standing committees may not even have
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
any insight at all I mean hopefully
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
there's some communication but just the
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
sheer volume of commissions that we have
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
it's it's unlikely that chairs are
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
getting all that information back to
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
them so I feel like they're losing
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
certainly Authority and and insight and
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
awareness on some of the things that are
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
being discussed during these commission
 
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.930 align:start position:0%
being discussed during these commission
meetings

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
the large majority of appointments are
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
needed at the same time at the new
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
biennium and I mentioned before that I
 
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.380 align:start position:0%
have my spreadsheet and I track it by
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
term end date but more than 90 percent
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
of those all are appointed at the
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
beginning of a new term so first of all
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
as you all know at the beginning of a
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
new term we have to have a speaker
 
00:56:44.569 --> 00:56:44.579 align:start position:0%
election we can't start making
 
00:56:46.010 --> 00:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
appointments until we have a speaker
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
speaker needs to make the appointments
 
00:56:51.849 --> 00:56:51.859 align:start position:0%
also largely the commissions require
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
members who serve on a certain policy
 
00:56:57.410 --> 00:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
standing committee so you know a member
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
of Judiciary a member of children and
 
00:57:02.089 --> 00:57:02.099 align:start position:0%
family so obviously after a new term we
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
have to have all of those appointments
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
made to the policy committees first
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
as everybody in this room knows it's
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
also a very busy time we have a lot of
 
00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
other things that we're doing in
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
December after the speaker is elected
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
after you're put on your policy
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
committees we're doing seating we're
 
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:19.980 align:start position:0%
doing parking there's a lot of work
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's going on so staff and legislators
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
and of course the speaker has competing
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
priorities so we're trying to meet the
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
dates of making these appointments but
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
another struggle with them being needed
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
at the same time as others are involved
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
in the appointment process so some that
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
say you know it requires a speaker
 
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:44.579 align:start position:0%
appointment it also requires an
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
appointment from the minority office so
 
00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have to wait to hear from
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
another office regardless of who's in
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
the majority or minority and then if
 
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:57.740 align:start position:0%
there are a few commissions that require
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
joint appointments so it may be the the
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
speaker the Senate President and the
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
minority leader from each of the Senate
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
it can be very time consuming to find
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
the right appointee
 
00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:17.579 align:start position:0%
so a pointy requirements may be too
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
specific I've already mentioned most of
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
the commissions require you be on a
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
particular policy committee but there
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
are other specifics as well one example
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
was a breastfeeding mother now at the
 
00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:30.020 align:start position:0%
time the legislator wrote that
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
particular legislation to create that
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
commission they may have had somebody in
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
mind and a reason for putting for
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
example a breastfeeding mother as a
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
required appointment by the speaker But
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
as time goes on it may be less you know
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit of an awkward an
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
awkward appointment for a speaker of the
 
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:50.660 align:start position:0%
house or a Senate President to make
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can consider instead of
 
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:54.780 align:start position:0%
being so specific on the appointments
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
instead reach out to non-profits or have
 
00:58:59.930 --> 00:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know breastfeeding mothers give
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
testimony in front of the commission
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's a high member turnover each
 
00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:07.069 align:start position:0%
there's a high member turnover each
biennium

00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
and it's challenging with 400 members
 
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
for the speaker or even the minority and
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
majority leaders to be able to get to
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
know your members when we're replacing a
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
hundred each term they all have
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
different skills different talents
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
different interests and different
 
00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:23.690 align:start position:0%
different interests and different
availability

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:59:25.970 --> 00:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
many members are unable to serve even
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
sponsors I have had people who sponsored
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
legislation so a new commission is going
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
to be created and they say I do not want
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
to be appointed to this do not appoint
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
me to this Commission
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
members change their mind about serving
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
or can't serve uh you know maybe their
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
circumstances change health reasons job
 
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
or whatever so we've made appointments
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
and then they come back and say I'm
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't serve and that's why some
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
of you who receive my appointment
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
notices get multiple and I apologize but
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
it starts the process over when somebody
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
few members serving impacts us greatly
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
and by few members I mentioned we have
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
400 house members for example but it's a
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
small percentage of those who actually
 
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
serve on the commissions so when we lose
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
them it's a great loss in in many ways
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Barbara Shaw served on 11
 
01:00:18.289 --> 01:00:18.299 align:start position:0%
commissions representative Dave
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
Danielson also served on approximately
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
11 commissions so when they passed away
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
last term not only are we dealing with
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
the loss of of a loved one a fellow
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
colleague of yours we also have to fill
 
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
colleague of yours we also have to fill
their

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
fill their place on their commissions
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then of course resignation somebody
 
01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
leaves the house same situation so it
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
impacts us in many ways when you have a
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
small number of legislators who are
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
serving on multiple commissions
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
the large number of commissions take
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
it just you know just the the the the
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
sheer volume of them and what we have to
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
do for tracking and managing them and
 
01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
the number of questions we get on them
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
inconsistent adherence to RSA for
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
appointments so we may have too many or
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
too few appointees when I took over this
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
job about two years ago
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
um I would find commissions where the
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
speaker was supposed to make two
 
01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:18.740 align:start position:0%
appointees and there were four four
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
appointees made including creating
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
alternates when alternates weren't part
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
of the RSA so it's it's tough because
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
there's some lack of accountability
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
there in in tracking these things I gave
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
here on the slide deck as an example
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
eliak the legislative youth advisory
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
Council this is one for a few terms
 
01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:41.700 align:start position:0%
people were making appointments just to
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
try to get the numbers up on this so
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
there were people who were serving
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
longer than they were supposed to be
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
serving we had more members than we were
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to have and so the cleanup
 
01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
process I'd be embarrassed to share how
 
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
much time it took to get that
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
straightened out
 
01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:00.059 align:start position:0%
and then it's just One Challenge is I
 
01:02:01.849 --> 01:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the the speaker makes
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
appointments but lots of times it will
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
say in consultation with a minority or
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
the minority leader has an appointment
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
so when I started two years ago I
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
noticed there were a lot of
 
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:13.030 align:start position:0%
noticed there were a lot of
um

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
this is not partisan at all but
 
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:18.180 align:start position:0%
Republicans weren't appointed now was
 
01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
the process for the Republicans who were
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
in The Minority at the time to look
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
through the commissions to make their
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
appointments or is it the role of the
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
speaker's office I reach out to the
 
01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
minority when their appointments to be
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
made that's a part of the process I I
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
put in place but it can be very
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and um and having a
 
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
standard process will will help us
 
01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a star next to that
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
one because that one was one that was
 
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
Quorum requirements a few of the
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
staffers here have talked about this so
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
from a Thor appointing authority
 
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.809 align:start position:0%
from a Thor appointing authority
perspective

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
I have many people coming to me Members
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
other staffers the Senate and I go to
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
the Senate sometimes saying look the
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
chair wants to get this meeting going
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
but they don't have enough appointees so
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
sometimes I work with the speaker he may
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
have three appointments to make but we
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
only have one member we like to wait
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
until we have all the members so I can
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
send out one appointment notice but they
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
need a quorum to be able to meet so if
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
we have one member I'll send out an
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
appointment notice for that one member
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
and then until we get the others so that
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
obviously is is time consuming in the
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
tracking in the appointment notices
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
getting out but it's important for those
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
commissions that need their members
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
appointed as soon as possible
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
next bullet updating data in the
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislative management system tool is
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
manual the data isn't current and it
 
01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
results in many questions so legislative
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
management tool this is basically our
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
website if you go to the website and
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
search on the RSA search on the
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
different commissions people will come
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
to me and say hey there's a rep here
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
listed they're they're appointed but
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
this member hasn't been a rep in two
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
years so the process right now is the
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
clerk's offices will make updates when
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
they hear of an update but if they're
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
not getting appointments made then the
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
then the website will be outdated and of
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
course this is a challenge at the end of
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
a term when it's outdated once the new
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
legislature is sworn in even if you're
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
serving on a commission because it's
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
coterminous with your term in office you
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
have to wait for the next appointment
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
notice to come out so it's very
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
challenging to get to keep that that
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
website updated another reason why many
 
01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
of us keep our own spreadsheets
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
accountability is lacking I've touched
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
on this in a couple other bullets but
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
some commissions don't meet there's no
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
indication if action is required from
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
the reports you know I mentioned that at
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
the generally at the end of a year
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
interim and final reports are sent to
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate President to the speaker of
 
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
the house to the governor and others
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's not clear if action is
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
required the speaker will review some
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
that he can but a lot of these reports
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
are extremely thick and he can't read
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
through all of these especially when
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
they're coming from hundreds of
 
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:04.309 align:start position:0%
they're coming from hundreds of
commissions

01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then there's no well previously no
 
01:05:08.809 --> 01:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
government governance to repeal
 
01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
commission so we have uh commissions
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
sitting around for for some time with no
 
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.730 align:start position:0%
sitting around for for some time with no
sunset

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
build text for new commissions is
 
01:05:23.099 --> 01:05:24.470 align:start position:0%
build text for new commissions is
inconsistent

01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
so some and again this has been uh some
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
areas of this have been fixed going
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
forward so it won't be as much of a
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
problem but no Sunset date
 
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
um some mention that there's mileage
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for legislators others do
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
not some mention a first named or a
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
chair some don't mention election of a
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
chair at all
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
there are lengthy commission names which
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
is extremely challenging I'm sure some
 
01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
of you when you enter the office and see
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
the the screen where it shows the
 
01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
meetings of the day there will be one
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
commission that has a name that takes up
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
the full screen that's how long the
 
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
commission names are
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
and then unclear terms and by this I
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
mean you know we've we've spoke to this
 
01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
mean you know we've we've spoke to this
but

01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
um your term on the commission may be
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
coterminous with your term in office but
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
others aren't as clear some will say
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
that as long as you're still a
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
legislator you can serve until another
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
person is appointed
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
and then some are a little bit confusing
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
and don't have any guidelines around how
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
long the term is at all and that's when
 
01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
I consult my my friend Jim Cianci over
 
01:06:27.539 --> 01:06:29.450 align:start position:0%
I consult my my friend Jim Cianci over
here

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
identifying new commissions is not easy
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
or consistent as I mentioned when I was
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the process I'm sometimes
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
notified by the clerks I'm notified by
 
01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
another member I'm notified by a state
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
department who says I need this
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
appointment made I'm notified by the
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
news and by searching rsas so when the
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
staff when we stop started meeting I
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
came to learn that all of us searched
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
through the rsas to find out if
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
commissions or boards or committees are
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
created and it's literally searching on
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
those that text looking if there's a
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
board advisory Council and that's
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming and it may
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
sound silly but that was the way that we
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
were finding all of the commissions and
 
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
if you take into consideration hb2 last
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
year there the it was in the double
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
digits the number of commissions that
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
were created in hb2 alone now my friends
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
in both Clerk's offices are going to
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
notify me so I won't be searching rsas
 
01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.770 align:start position:0%
notify me so I won't be searching rsas
anymore

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
anymore
foreign

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
next bullet legislation has meeting or
 
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
report deadlines that may be
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
unattainable very difficult to meet so a
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
new bill comes in by the time it's
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor and then gets on
 
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:38.180 align:start position:0%
my desk it already may be
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
too late we haven't even made
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
appointments to the commission yet and
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to meet last month
 
01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140 align:start position:0%
lots of times the meetings or final
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
reports are in you know November or
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
December but there have been a couple
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
that were like October 15th and I'm
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
and then after a new term new
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
commissions have just started so they
 
01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:02.220 align:start position:0%
lose momentum so we we create a new
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
commission the appointment gets out they
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
start meeting in November and now
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's an election and some of the
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislators may be here for the next
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
term some may not but either way it
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
makes it challenging and confusing
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
confusing when I send out a new
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
appointment notice and somebody's like
 
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
and now I will turn it over to my friend
 
01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.450 align:start position:0%
and now I will turn it over to my friend

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
Anne
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
thanks Debra
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
so when we come everything that has been
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
shared by the entire staff panel house
 
01:08:37.249 --> 01:08:37.259 align:start position:0%
Community Services agrees with every
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
single thing and practically everything
 
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
was brought up I was going to emphasize
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
as well and how it impacts our staff
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
because we are the ones who end up
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
sitting in these conditions or
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
committees throughout their term whether
 
01:08:54.249 --> 01:08:54.259 align:start position:0%
it's July to December or a couple years
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
for the most part we are the ones who
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
sit there with them and we deal with the
 
01:09:02.169 --> 01:09:02.179 align:start position:0%
outside membership
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
that doesn't understand the legislative
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
culture or how the legislative staff
 
01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.229 align:start position:0%
culture or how the legislative staff
functions

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
functions
 
01:09:11.329 --> 01:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
my first bullet I put up we have the
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
numerous new committees and commissions
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
so while we're just working with the
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
previous ones also and we get a new
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
slate of them and we have to start all
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
over again with these new ones and add
 
01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:23.299 align:start position:0%
them on top of the old ones
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes we have commissions as Paul
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned they're already in existence
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
they're already working on issues and
 
01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:33.299 align:start position:0%
the members brought in a new bill and
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the commission was passed and studying
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
the exact same thing so we staff have to
 
01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:40.940 align:start position:0%
sit and explain to the new membership
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
yes you're brand new but this already
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
exists and you might want to contact the
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
previous commission or the existing
 
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
commission see how much work they've
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
done we had this process several years
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
ago when we had six six commissions at
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
the same time on dcyf and the head of
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
dcif had to attend one time all six
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
commissions were meeting the exact same
 
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
week and he spent all this time here at
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
meetings telling each group what he was
 
01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:08.810 align:start position:0%
meetings telling each group what he was
doing

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
so it's very frustrating for staff to
 
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:13.460 align:start position:0%
see that happening
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we so when you add the new
 
01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
commission commissions we do go through
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
legislation as everyone mentioned we all
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
have to search everywhere to find these
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
items we did in 2010 or start I think in
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
09 what that was our first major search
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
and we had all staff involved we had
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
legislation I was precursor to
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative evil studies it was
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative Lori Harding was in
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
charge and all of OLS our entire office
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
the Senate staff we searched everything
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
it came up with the master list of all
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
the existing commissions and and we
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
thought this was the end-all to be all
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
and then 10 years later we were back at
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
the same things because they grow and as
 
01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
we've mentioned we come up with plans
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
and ideas in fact
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
um it's not in binder although I do love
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
binders but this expandable file holds
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
all of the staff recommendations so
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've had over the years on how to help
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
curb these and we do okay for a year or
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
two and then we're back to the same
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
situation because members figure out how
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
to bring in new legislation so for
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
instance a new bill a Senate Bill I just
 
01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
spotted on Friday actually as we
 
01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.130 align:start position:0%
spotted on Friday actually as we
mentioned

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
um when we amended 14 you amended 1449
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
last year we came up with the 15 member
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
commission and we also and Paul it has
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's limited outside correct is that
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
okay so what what the legislation says
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
now is
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
within the um where would you used to
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
say I would say a member of the Bia will
 
01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
now say
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
um it directs the Bia and say New
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire auto dealers another group
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
they're to get together and come up with
 
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
one person to represent them so that's
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
the way but that how will the clerk's
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
office write to all those entities and
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
explain to them this is what you have to
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
do so that's a new workaround so every
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
time we go over here there's another way
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
they figure um
 
01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
around it so that's how we get to all
 
01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
these numerous new communities and
 
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.990 align:start position:0%
these numerous new communities and
commissions

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and then my next bullet point
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
commissions have large memberships one
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
of the biggest challenges we ever had
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
was when a 45-member commission was
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
created we couldn't we tried to square
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
the rooms around there was no way we
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
could house a 45-member commission here
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
so luckily we found a place at Seacoast
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that's where they met and we had
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
um a member who was very active with
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
house community services so we were able
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
to be it was all outside people Regional
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
planning groups I think we had one or
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
two members on it so we worked with all
 
01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
the regional planning groups and they
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
actually came and met with us and we
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
instructed them on the legislative
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
process and what to do but you can
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
imagine that's taking our time away from
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
working with other um committees
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and Deborah emphasized my next bullet
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
it takes a long time to make all the
 
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
appointments so um and not all entities
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
want to be on a commission in one
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
instance we had a member who kept
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
bugging us uh or Not by getting this you
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
know asking us please please please they
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
wanted us to call all the organizations
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
to find out why they hadn't appointed
 
01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
anyone well that takes a great deal of
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
time but in one instance we did make
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
some calls the organization said we we
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be active in this study we
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
want nothing to do with this study and
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
we told the member and the member said
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
well they they have to and then and the
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
organization said we're not appointing
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
anybody so we couldn't make a quorum
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and then again sometimes by the time
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Quorum has been met and this has
 
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
happened not only has it passed the
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
effective date but sometimes we have not
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
made a quorum until the reporting week
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
until November 1 or in in one case over
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
the last two years the committee sat
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
vacant for 18 months it could not meet a
 
01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
quorum because it could not find anybody
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
who was willing to sit on the commission
 
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.090 align:start position:0%
who was willing to sit on the commission
um

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
the non-legislator chairs and
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
non-legislative members it can often be
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
difficult because as I mentioned earlier
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
they don't understand the culture of the
 
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
legislative process they have they other
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
than right to know they have no rules to
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
follow they don't have the speaker they
 
01:14:26.689 --> 01:14:26.699 align:start position:0%
the chief of staff is not here and we
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
could have some very unique individuals
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
who have expectations of staff that we
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
are there to solely serve that one
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
commission and we need to explain that
 
01:14:40.490 --> 01:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
we we um not only do we have our
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
standing committee work but we have to
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
be available for other commissions and
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
other chapter studies and especially as
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
you all know you have again a 21 member
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
commission well in the old days but who
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
knows what will change and then you have
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
only one or two legislators on it and
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
the other 19 people you're working for
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
even the chairman
 
01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
um is now a member of the legislature
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's a senator the house
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
staff is working for
 
01:15:05.159 --> 01:15:06.169 align:start position:0%
staff is working for
um

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:06.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
so this can
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and then the continuity that that
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
Deborah mentioned that can also also
 
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.250 align:start position:0%
Deborah mentioned that can also also
happen

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
um particularly on the long-term study
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
timeline issues my last bullet
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so what happens is and here's she was
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
wonderful uh representative Mary Stuart
 
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
guile had a fantastic commission 10
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
years she worked on this thing she had
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
all of her everything was done
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately before she retired there
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
was no repeal date on her legislation so
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
the new Administration appointed someone
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
to that and that member wanted to get
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
going again but all the committee the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
entire commission membership said no
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're done our work here is completed
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
but the new member did not agree with
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
that and so that new member kept going
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
from office to office trying to get
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
um going and and finally we scheduled
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
the meeting and everybody who attended
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
the meeting said our work is done but
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the prep work that staff had to take
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
to set that up
 
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
um was unfortunate
 
01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:04.130 align:start position:0%
um was unfortunate
um

01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
and you have as as Paul mentioned that
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
situation where we had there was a large
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation that came in with the
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
study commission and within that
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
legislation it specifically said no
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
legislative staff was to be involved in
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
this study that's why I was supposed to
 
01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:21.179 align:start position:0%
be completely out of here well once the
 
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
bill was uh passed and uh the
 
01:16:29.689 --> 01:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
um sponsor they came to legislative
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
staff the LBA accounting our office I
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
said what do we do so this says right
 
01:16:36.590 --> 01:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
here not to do anything well where do we
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
go what do we do
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
well that was should that hadn't been
 
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
all thought out and how do we do this
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
so that took a great deal of time
 
01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
several offices several days and trying
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to proceed
 
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
um we have and I can go on obviously I
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of anecdote
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
um stories I can tell you over the years
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
I've I've dealt with all this and as I
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned we had the 2010 study and then
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
all the three studies that
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative evil worked so hard on
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
and yet here we are explaining
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
everything to you and that's why I
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
thought this was such a wonderful
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for staff because you have
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
to see we can see all the numbers
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
hanging there but we all need to see
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
what is the problem in the background
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
and how do you members solve it because
 
01:17:26.689 --> 01:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
what members
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
the cultures changed when I came in 84
 
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
we had just gotten done with the
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention and we had
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
just passed um annual sessions and one
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
of the things that was stated and I kept
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
hearing from everywhere we're no longer
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to have commissions the standing
 
01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
committees will now study all these
 
01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:44.930 align:start position:0%
committees will now study all these
issues

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:17:46.970 --> 01:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
and here we are
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
so um so that's something to consider
 
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
that was a goal back then and
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
um then you can
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
a chair one of my chairs had a two-year
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
study on special education and it was
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
fantastic but it was ad hoc the
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee worked so hard and they came
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
out with nine pieces of legislation but
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
the issue stayed in the committee and
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
they discussed it and they worked within
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
their committee it was not assigned to a
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
statutory that that took it outside of
 
01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
the realm of the legislators the ones
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
who are elected to do this
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and as Deborah also mentioned
 
01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
we do run into a lot of members who are
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
named to a commission
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
um or or it's a it's a brand new
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
commission and they're first named and
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
they're organizing and yet another
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
member wanted it to be studied but
 
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
wanted nothing to do with the issue and
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
as as Dave mentioned
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
we've often said in anecdotally we've
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
heard um because Myla you know head of
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
OLS researcher research we're best
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
friends so we work together all the time
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunate that
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
someone goes into drafting they have an
 
01:19:04.370 --> 01:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
idea they don't have time to do the
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
research so they say well let's create a
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
commission it's unfortunate they didn't
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
go in a month or two ahead of time go
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
into see Myla and say could could your
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
office please look this up for us or
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
also even with our own committees um the
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
standing committees if we created
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
subcommes while they're I know we we
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
went very fast this session but
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes that's one of the great things
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
about retained bills you have more time
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
to study but it's being held within your
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee and it's the legislators who
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
are in charge not some outside group and
 
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
we do know again anecdotally that
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
they're outside groups lobbying groups
 
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:42.659 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups who promote commissions
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
with their own membership because say
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to work on
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
policy and that's not a bad idea because
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
if you have a chaptered study these
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
people can come and talk before you they
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
don't have to be an appointment to the
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
group that's another thing members don't
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
always understand that you can have say
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
a five-member chaptered study and invite
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
the 10
 
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and have them come in and
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
meet with your group and meet come to
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
every meeting
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
because what you're trying to do is
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
share the information as I mentioned
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
about representative Mary Stuart guile
 
01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780 align:start position:0%
and also representative Pat abrami they
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
were real driving forces behind their
 
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
study commissions and with when
 
01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
representative Gile had retired and
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
obviously representative brahmi left
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
this past session and their commissions
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
that drive is gone and what happens is
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
who picks up the slack
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
um to push those studies
 
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.649 align:start position:0%
um to push those studies
so

01:20:36.649 --> 01:20:36.659 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
that's been my experience in the
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
experience of our office but it's also
 
01:20:45.169 --> 01:20:45.179 align:start position:0%
is shared in that as you've heard from
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
every one of us here it's the amount
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the issue of the study a study
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
is a study you it's the vehicle that
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're using and so that vehicle takes
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
so much time and energy wouldn't it be
 
01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
better to have that time and energy
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
devoted to analyzing whatever the issue
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
may be as opposed to trying to organize
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
um so I hope that um from our
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
perspective or my perspective I was able
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
to share some of that
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
with all of you
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and that's it for me thank you
 
01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
oh gosh yes oh my gosh so I
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative and I said come here I've
 
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
seen that so so anyway those are all the
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
studies since 1981 they're upstairs on
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
the fourth floor lots and lots and lots
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
of boxes and then and that doesn't even
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
include all the electronic um
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
studies but that's where they go
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where where you can find them
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so much for your
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
patience and listening to us it's
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
clearly very uh we're all passionate
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
about the subject matter
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
and we know it's a lot of information
 
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
but want to open it up to questions
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor
 
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:03.890 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor
um

01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of questions I'll kick
 
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
it off and then I'll turn it over to the
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
committee that asks what questions you
 
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.530 align:start position:0%
committee that asks what questions you
have

01:22:11.530 --> 01:22:11.540 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of things
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh kind of picking up where Ann left off
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
as as we look at
 
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
the breadth of committee chairmanships
 
01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:29.630 align:start position:0%
the breadth of committee chairmanships
across

01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature that you know you look
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
you know you're a committee chair you're
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
in charge of the Agricultural uh
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
committee whatever would it be
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate to say that oh and by the
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
way you have oversight of these 15
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
commissions and you in finance you have
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
oversight of these 27 commissions so
 
01:22:53.570 --> 01:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
that all the commissions could be split
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
up by committee chair to uh
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
to provide oversight to provide
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
leadership commentary and so forth is
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
that is is that an option available to
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
us or is that a rules issue
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
well the the way
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it now for the past
 
01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
couple years and this year too is that
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
Deborah usually contacts the committee
 
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
chair for recommendations
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
and in context you know the Democratic
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
office for recommendations depending on
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
how the commission is done
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
so in essence
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
they are kind of
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
split up not reality but in essence they
 
01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
are pretty much split up because
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
we are just having and we've had had
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm sure speaker Charlotte have
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
had the same problem people want these
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
things but they don't want to serve on
 
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.470 align:start position:0%
things but they don't want to serve on
them

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why we have members you know
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
serving on multiple loved ones because
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're the only ones that are willing
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
and that's why these things have become
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
such a problem is that if we could split
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
it up between all 400 members
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
that would take the load off the members
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
that are serving but it doesn't
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
alleviate the problem of where they're
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
going to meet in all the other things
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
that go along with it
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
but it's it's it's getting out of hand
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I I have full confidence that you
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
know as a as a committee you guys can
 
01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:32.540 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
I will tell you one thing uh that I have
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
made a decision that if the first name
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of a committee or a a
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
commission especially is going to be put
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
on that Commission
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman just to just to address
 
01:24:51.229 --> 01:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
your your direct question though the the
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is you ask about
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
having oversight of those commissions
 
01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
that the situation is you can't
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
the the the commissions are are really
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
autonomous yes they rely on us somewhat
 
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day their
 
01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:09.649 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day their
recommendation

01:25:09.649 --> 01:25:09.659 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
the report that they draft that that
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
might say we should sponsor a bill that
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
does these 15 things it's up to then up
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
to the legislative member to file that
 
01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
to the legislative member to file that
legislation

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
so again it's
 
01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:27.300 align:start position:0%
yes it sounds great that we say to
 
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:30.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler hey these these 15
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
commissions are under the purview of
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
Finance but if representative Weiler
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
decides to go to those 15 commission
 
01:25:38.450 --> 01:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
meetings and give them what for they can
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
tell them exactly what for back
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
and if I may share one way that chairs
 
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:48.140 align:start position:0%
have been able to help in the past uh
 
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:50.900 align:start position:0%
representative rice and Senator Carson
 
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
working with staff looked at a lot of
 
01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.010 align:start position:0%
working with staff looked at a lot of
their

01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:55.020 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
children and family related commissions
 
01:25:59.330 --> 01:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
and were able to consolidate some last
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
term so they took two or three and moved
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
them into another commission the
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
children oversight commission so that
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
was one way that they Consolidated it
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
saying hey these are it's like subject
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
matter and we can move that into one
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
commission okay a question for the for
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
the legal guys
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
and then I'll turn it over the rest of
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
the committee for questions I know a
 
01:26:21.719 --> 01:26:22.490 align:start position:0%
the committee for questions I know a
different

01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
there are different uh Lo probably lower
 
01:26:27.709 --> 01:26:27.719 align:start position:0%
forms of government at the local level
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
that deal with this problem of
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
people not showing up or no Quorum uh
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh in the way that they
 
01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
typically do it would be
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
if you don't if you don't show up for a
 
01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
meeting three times in a row you're off
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
you're gone and uh and it's up to the
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
committee chair to reappoint somebody
 
01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
else or whoever the pointing Authority
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
is the other the other part of that
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
would be if the if the committee we've
 
01:26:59.570 --> 01:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
heard about committee or commissions
 
01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
that don't achieve a quorum over and
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
over again
 
01:27:05.450 --> 01:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh that if the quorum's not achieved X
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
number of times in a row the com the
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee is automatically or the
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
commission is disbanded uh
 
01:27:15.290 --> 01:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
so is are those would those be options
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
that we could pursue uh as you know in
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
you could um you'd have you'd have to
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
specify it in the statute and I think
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
this gets back to the issue of so to
 
01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
borrow your example say you had a um
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me a standing committee or a
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
chaptered committee and you had a member
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the House who consistently just
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
didn't show up the speaker within his
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
authority can replace that member I mean
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's clear under our house
 
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
rules it's under our practice and
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
precedent and it's an easy process to do
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
same thing with lack of corn because
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's within our Authority within our
 
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.310 align:start position:0%
it's within our Authority within our
body

01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
when it's a statutory commission and
 
01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
Paul hinted on this this in response to
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
your previous question
 
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.169 align:start position:0%
your previous question
um

01:28:03.169 --> 01:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
certainly I think there's some leeway to
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
do that but if it's not specified in the
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
statute that process for replacing
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
members or a lack of Quorum or
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
disbanding for lack of Quorum it's an
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
open question
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I sort of the theme of
 
01:28:20.149 --> 01:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
my presentation was in the absence of
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority there's not as much
 
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
guidance or oversight versus a standing
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
committee or a chaptered committee or
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
even an ad hoc there's much more
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
authority to do the types of things that
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting would that be some
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
standard language you could advise us on
 
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
that when somebody comes when a
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
legislature comes to you and says they
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
want to create a commission
 
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
that you could advise them that one of
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
the things that the speaker would like
 
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
to have is this standard language and in
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
that standard language would be
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know the uh three
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh meetings and you're out or three lack
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
of quorums and the committee is a
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
commission is dismanded I mean is that
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
something that that we could put in
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
place that that the legislature may not
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
be aware of that you are a template to
 
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
them and here's here's how to create a
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
commission language
 
01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think you could draft
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
something I'd want to think about how to
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
do that particularly in terms of if it's
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
a legislative member versus a
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
non-legislative member because again
 
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
you're when you're creating a statutory
 
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
Commission in in many ways you're
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
seeding a certain level of legislative
 
01:29:30.659 --> 01:29:31.970 align:start position:0%
seeding a certain level of legislative
Authority

01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and so you'd have to be very specific
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
about you know the consequences of any
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
person missing three meetings and then
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
who can replace it and potentially if
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's a challenge to that say the
 
01:29:44.330 --> 01:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
person couldn't attend three meetings
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
because they were sick
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
um you know you'd have to be pretty
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
clear I think on how you'd want to do it
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting you couldn't
 
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
but there are different considerations
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
and commissions versus the other types
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
of studies thank you I have some more
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll turn it over to my
 
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.189 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll turn it over to my
colleagues

01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
okay I can't please
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
well I have to say I have a little bit
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
of PTSD just listening to all this
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
because I think we all talked so much
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
about all this stuff and it's just
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
phenomenal uh to see it all written down
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for doing it I
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
just have a couple of comments if that's
 
01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
all right if as opposed to questions I
 
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
guess one thing I just I'm not sure
 
01:30:28.370 --> 01:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
everyone is aware but when you're
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the numbers of
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
commissions I mean my memory is that we
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
had like 180 to 200 commissions we just
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
had an unbelievable number and it
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
required something in the vicinity of
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
300 appointments so if you think of all
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
the other work that's going on at the
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
beginning of a term to do all those
 
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
appointments too is just kind of um
 
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.550 align:start position:0%
appointments too is just kind of um
mind-blowing

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
mind-blowing
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I just there was just several things
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
I just want to add to the conversation
 
01:31:00.410 --> 01:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
so one is uh when Paul was talking about
 
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
culture one of the things is that it's
 
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
really hard to get legislators to accept
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
um a a a chaptered study committee a
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
five-person legislator based committee
 
01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
can do work as well if not better as a
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
commission that has you know a dozen to
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
two dozen members that I don't know if
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's a status sort of concept but you
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
really I mean I've done it both ways you
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
can have a legislative study commission
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
and believe me the people that are
 
01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:36.780 align:start position:0%
interested will show up every time and
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
you can make like working groups and you
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
can come up with really effective
 
01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.490 align:start position:0%
can come up with really effective
recommendations

01:31:42.490 --> 01:31:42.500 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the legislators Drive the process I
 
01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
learned this from Anne the legislators
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
Drive the process as opposed to
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
everybody else and it's much easier to
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
get a quorum in those circumstances than
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
with many of these commissions
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
legislators just have to take a little
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
bit of responsibility the other thing is
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
they appoint they want these appointees
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
as you folks described but the
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
legislators should be asking the people
 
01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
who they want to be on these commissions
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
whether they even want to be
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of times they just don't I mean I
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
remember the Bia had been appointed to
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
like 10 committees and they just
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it and so you know just
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
thinking about policy the legislators
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
have to take uh responsibility the other
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
thing is a lot of times freshmen
 
01:32:33.649 --> 01:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
legislators that's one of the they come
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and they want to do a commission or a
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
committee and they end up being the
 
01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
first main member and they're the ones
 
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
that take the most hand-holding because
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
they have absolutely no experience with
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh with doing it and it just it it makes
 
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
things really
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um complicated the other thing I just
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
want to say and I want this is sort of a
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
question one thing that we learned going
 
01:32:59.930 --> 01:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
through it is
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether a Senate bill or a
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
house bill created a study committee the
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
house committee Services was really
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
being expected to Bear The laboring Ore
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
and hopefully at this point it's been
 
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
pretty clear now that if it's a senate
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
created study committee the Senate Bears
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
the laboring or and not the house that
 
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:24.020 align:start position:0%
that that is is going to be
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
re-emphasized uh when we have Germans
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
and a vice Germans meeting that if the
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill comes over
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
and wants to have us be in charge of it
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
that that is going to be an amendment to
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
that commission before it's passed that
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
the Senate is the ones that are going to
 
01:33:43.129 --> 01:33:43.139 align:start position:0%
be in charge if it's the Senate
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
commission right because it's not it's
 
01:33:47.810 --> 01:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
not yeah it's not it's not right and and
 
01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:48.770 align:start position:0%
not yeah it's not it's not right and and
uh

01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
maybe that'll stop them sending over
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
commissions I think we got 25 or 30 or
 
01:33:56.990 --> 01:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
something again this time I know what in
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
the bills they send over 172 bills and
 
01:34:01.729 --> 01:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
there's got to be 25 or 30 Commissions
 
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
so just one other comment um as much as
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
we dislike study committees and
 
01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.709 align:start position:0%
we dislike study committees and
commissions

01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
well run they really do provide really
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
good information so one of the big
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
um impetuses especially in the the last
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
committee on committees that we did is
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
to try to make sure that if you're doing
 
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
a commission or a committee the
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
information the report gets to the
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
people that should have it and that I
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
mean in my mind was always committee
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
chairs that serves two purposes one is
 
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
they know that these committees exist so
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be duplicating them and
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
the other thing is they have the benefit
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the report so I understand like when
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
um Paul just said that sometimes it's
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
not clear who the right person is to get
 
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
that but my fallback would be you just
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
send it to both but the point is if
 
01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to go to all this effort we
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
just really have to get the information
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
um to the people that should have it so
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
they can benefit from it and the only
 
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
other thing that we heard on several
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
occasions was that people who are
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
preparing these reports there should be
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
a little more specificity in the statute
 
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
on what should be in the reports because
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
if they're producing reports they should
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
be useful
 
01:35:31.330 --> 01:35:31.340 align:start position:0%
so that's that's just sort of my
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
comments but thank you ever so much for
 
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.390 align:start position:0%
comments but thank you ever so much for
this

01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
but uh I I I want to make it I guess
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
make it clear I'm not saying we should
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
never pass any commissions or committees
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
or anything else I chair the commission
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
that set up the Moose plate and I mean
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of work too but anyways
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
we had a number of different agencies
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
and everything involved in that so it's
 
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
not to ban them but if we're going to
 
01:36:05.330 --> 01:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
create them let's make damn sure that
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing something in that they
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually meet and they actually
 
01:36:13.310 --> 01:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
accomplish something or as you said if
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's one that's similar then let's
 
01:36:20.410 --> 01:36:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
so the other problem like with the
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
committee on committees we really
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't take substantive action so if
 
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
you want to do the thing where you
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
combine thing uh three or four
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
committees that have similar topics it's
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
really hard to do that if you're not the
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
policy committee so that's just
 
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
something I don't know whether a
 
01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
committee a committee could make a
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation or or whatever but it's
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
really hard if you're not the policy
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee I think to take a substantive
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
position on a policy matter
 
01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
what I think
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
thank you who who else uh on the
 
01:37:04.570 --> 01:37:04.580 align:start position:0%
committee would like to speak yes
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much Mr
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you all for coming and
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
doing this presentation today I've had a
 
01:37:12.649 --> 01:37:12.659 align:start position:0%
lot of things on my mind and I one of
 
01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
the things I thought back on is when we
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
had the right to know commission it was
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
a very large one and I don't remember
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
the details of it but I do remember
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
there was a terrible terrible problem
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum to do anything and that
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
Commission because they couldn't get
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything done decided to have
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
legislation filed so they could continue
 
01:37:33.010 --> 01:37:33.020 align:start position:0%
the commission on which they did nothing
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I don't mean to be
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
critical but that's what happened and I
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
sat on the committee which they reported
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
to Judiciary and um they came back
 
01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:45.659 align:start position:0%
finally with a piece of legislation that
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
made no sense and said we know it makes
 
01:37:51.770 --> 01:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
no sense but we are required to file
 
01:37:54.530 --> 01:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
something what do we do with a
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
commission that's not getting anything
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
done I don't remember how that
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
commission dissolved I don't remember
 
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
what happened but is there some system
 
01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
we can have in place if if a quorum
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
can't be brought together or if a
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
commission can't accomplish anything is
 
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
there something we can do to stop a
 
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
commission besides having a sun setting
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
preposition I think it just laid out one
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
of your charges
 
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and also made me stop and think about
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
some other processes in terms of people
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
sponsoring I do know if one member
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
won't speak of who it is was yes uh who
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
was very proud of serving on 14
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
different commissions how does one
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
extend himself or herself to serve on so
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
many and how does work get done
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
when there are so many commissions that
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
again seem to be duplicative or similar
 
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
to each other but not quite duplicative
 
01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:56.580 align:start position:0%
well that that again is one of the main
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
problems is that
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
so small amount of members actually
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
serve on so many different committees
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
and commissions because it's it's the
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
only ones we can get to do it
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh and I you know I mean as we say we uh
 
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
Deborah calls the committee chairman and
 
01:39:16.729 --> 01:39:16.739 align:start position:0%
finds out you know their recommendations
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
and then the phone calls have to be made
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
are you willing to serve and a vast
 
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
majority of the time members says oh no
 
01:39:27.290 --> 01:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm too busy I haven't got time and you
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
know that kind of thing so it again it
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
comes down to
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
a small amount of members serving on
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
multiple committees
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
and and I think that detracts from the
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh the ability of the uh you know the
 
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
Committees to to meet and actually
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
present good what you know good uh
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
solutions to whatever the uh committee
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
was formed for
 
01:39:54.530 --> 01:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can I can I try to address
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
this this actually gets back to another
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
point that representative evil mentioned
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I might suggest you as a committee uh
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
invite the various committee chairs here
 
01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh so that they can share those
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
duplicative commissions with you uh
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
certainly representative Ladd who serves
 
01:40:15.770 --> 01:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
on three dozen of those things can talk
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
about that with respect to education and
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps that can be the basis of
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that that you all put
 
01:40:25.729 --> 01:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
forward for next year so so it might be
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
a good idea to to consider uh bringing
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
your colleagues in for for those kind of
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
conversations and are you suggesting a
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
consolidation piece of legislation type
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
well I mean it that just that was just
 
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
based off of the the comments from
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative wall and representative
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
evil being a policy decision it if you
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
bring the policy committees together to
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions uh for you all
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
to to put in joint legislation on it
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
that might be a good idea
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.229 align:start position:0%
that might be a good idea
question

01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.239 --> 01:40:58.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
I've been on committees before one in
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
particular where we discouraged members
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
from filing bills for commissions and
 
01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
explained that we were taking people
 
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
away from the state agencies and
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
departments where they needed to do
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
their work and spending too much time
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
over here that's why we would have a
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
study committee so they could come and
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
be referenced people but not serve on
 
01:41:22.149 --> 01:41:22.159 align:start position:0%
the commission as members
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
I agree with the fact that we ought to
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
have the leadership of the Committees
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
talking with the members about all this
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
but I think also be very helpful during
 
01:41:34.729 --> 01:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
orientation a lot of new members come in
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
and are going to change the world and I
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
respect that to some extent
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
but all of a sudden we see a lot of
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees set up and I
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
don't think we are explaining that well
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
enough to new members they don't
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
understand the amount of time and
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility it takes to serve on
 
01:41:53.810 --> 01:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
these just a comment thank you
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
sure yeah I I sounds like a
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation to me I I don't want to
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
impugn anyone's intentions but I think I
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
have seen
 
01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
where somebody comes in with with the
 
01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
with the world on a on a pin and wanting
 
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
to change it uh
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
and they get into their committee and
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's not going well
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
so rather than let the proposed Bill die
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
they convince their colleagues to study
 
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:22.070 align:start position:0%
they convince their colleagues to study
it

01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
and study it on a commission or whatever
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
to say and just to keep it alive and
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
that that unfortunately happens too
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
often any anybody else want to jump in
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
or has a thought yes representative
 
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so I
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
I've sort of jotted down a number of
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
bullet points that I think are potential
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
courses of action and I guess I just
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to go through those and hear
 
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh from anybody who's interested in
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
chiming in sort of is this
 
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
is that am I on the right track is this
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
kind of uh complete list or is there
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
anything else here so I think some of
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
what I heard was obviously we could
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
repeal repeal or consolidate some of
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
these that would be introducing new
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
legislation we could
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
um promote standardized standardization
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
of some of the language around these any
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
future committees or commissions that
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
get established
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
um also editing the enabling language in
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 1449 to perhaps incorporate some
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
automatic sunsets you know some some
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions that would sort of
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
automatically Sunset some of these
 
01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.090 align:start position:0%
automatically Sunset some of these
things

01:43:34.090 --> 01:43:34.100 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
educate standing committees and
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee chairs about the possibility
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
of studying some of these as a standing
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
committee rather than creating another
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
committee and then
 
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
um in line with a comment that was just
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
made I I think
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
um educating new members but to some
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
extent perhaps existing members as well
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's always it's people want to be nice
 
01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
I don't want to kill your bill it's a
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
study commit yeah I can vote for that
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
and and and so I I think it's it's a
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
classic example of where we're looking
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
at the the the the benefits but we're
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
not looking at the costs and so
 
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:11.149 align:start position:0%
not looking at the costs and so
um

01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:14.090 --> 01:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
I I almost feel like we need a uh a
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
summary of what has been discussed so
 
01:44:18.290 --> 01:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
far in the room today that we give to
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
every uh committee chair and we say you
 
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
know before you you know at the
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
beginning of the exact session on any
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill that creates a standing committee
 
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
read through these challenges that that
 
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh that we experience as a result of
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
having too many of these so that was
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
kind of my list of notes as as I've been
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
listening today and I'm just curious to
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
hear whether that is there anything else
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
that we should add to that is there
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
anything on there that doesn't belong on
 
01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.430 align:start position:0%
anything on there that doesn't belong on
there

01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:44:46.129 --> 01:44:46.139 align:start position:0%
um just looking for thoughts
 
01:44:48.970 --> 01:44:48.980 align:start position:0%
thank you anybody else
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do soon here is talk
 
01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:53.390 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do soon here is talk
about

01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
fall our fallen one meetings for our
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee here and what the schedule
 
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
might look like
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
um and uh taking lunch break here in a
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
few minutes and uh come back in about an
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
hour or so uh any further comments from
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
the uh from the panel yes
 
01:45:15.649 --> 01:45:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Dolan one of
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
the things I want to mention
 
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
um in the material that we're going to
 
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
hand out to later we do have a list of
 
01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:25.820 align:start position:0%
when we try to create
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
consistent language in in the drafting
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
um of some of these bills so for
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
instance we used to have committee
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
reports that could come in on any day
 
01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:36.980 align:start position:0%
and then we decide November 1
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
was was the best day because it was
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
right before the election then and then
 
01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
but this was
 
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
um had been in agreement I think in 1995
 
01:45:47.689 --> 01:45:47.699 align:start position:0%
by the speaker and the Senate President
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
and also reports could go anywhere and
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
at that point in time is when it was
 
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
listed the speaker the Senate President
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
the governor the two clerks and the
 
01:45:59.930 --> 01:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
State Library so we have had an in and
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the material will hand out to you we
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
have the um not only the list of the
 
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
legislative initiatives but just the
 
01:46:10.129 --> 01:46:10.139 align:start position:0%
general initiatives by practice or
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
agreement on on how we could shape some
 
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
of these these things so at least you'll
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
have some historical perspective on how
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
to move forward and hopefully coming up
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
with suggestions on how we could
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
um possibly recommend to the drafters if
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
we could be consistent in this language
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
it could help everyone to understand
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
um I mean I have to add this one piece
 
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
though even though we came up with that
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
November one deadline
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
then eventually
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
um years later because you don't have
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
the same Administration some some in the
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
Senate changed it to December 1 and then
 
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
it did cause a problem of or January 1
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
and did cause a problem that we had
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
before but that's only been in a few
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
since it hasn't been a a big problem but
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
I just want you to know if that exists
 
01:47:00.890 --> 01:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
and you'll be able to see that list laid
 
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.149 align:start position:0%
and you'll be able to see that list laid
out

01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
we have a few next steps that we wanted
 
01:47:21.410 --> 01:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
to touch on before we part
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
um first of all staff is going to
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
continue to meet and work on some of the
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
Improvement opportunities that we've
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
been focused on one being a data cleanup
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
and some type of it solution so we can
 
01:47:33.169 --> 01:47:33.179 align:start position:0%
get rid of our multiple spreadsheets and
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
and have all of the data available to
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislators and staff so we are working
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
in sorry in your binder when you receive
 
01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:45.659 align:start position:0%
your binder at the end there is a draft
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
list of commissions just so you know we
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
put that together just for your purposes
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
so we Consolidated mine and house
 
01:47:53.870 --> 01:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee services in the Senate and
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
created one for you we do have a lot
 
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
more columns in our own spreadsheets but
 
01:48:02.450 --> 01:48:02.460 align:start position:0%
we tried to include name RSA and then if
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
the if the commission is meeting
 
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
we're also we've been talking about uh
 
01:48:10.129 --> 01:48:10.139 align:start position:0%
continuing ed opportunities to help
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
educate legislators on the commissions
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
and some of our challenges as well
 
01:48:15.169 --> 01:48:15.179 align:start position:0%
that's something we expect that will
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
work with work with you on and then a
 
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
potential you know cheat sheet or
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
tri-fold of commission guidelines
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
um just you know before somebody files
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
legislation Because by the time they get
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
to OLS as Dave mentioned where too late
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes so if we can get some
 
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
guidelines in front of legislators as
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
soon as possible
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
and now we can give you your binders
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
before you part for lunch and just want
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
you to know that we are here this is
 
01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
important to all of us so if you need us
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
please reach out to any of us and thank
 
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:47.820 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
01:48:49.930 --> 01:48:49.940 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
we have at our disposal uh
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
room 104 on the first floor which is
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
right right next to the guard desk and
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the kiosk mileage kiosk on the right
 
01:49:04.209 --> 01:49:04.219 align:start position:0%
hand side as you come in the back door
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
so uh what I'm thinking is that you may
 
01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:11.219 align:start position:0%
not want to drag these uh binders around
 
01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
with you everywhere you go
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh like I know John Willy he's a he's
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
crazy for binders but
 
01:49:18.119 --> 01:49:18.830 align:start position:0%
crazy for binders but
um

01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
if you want to store them in 104 in the
 
01:49:23.930 --> 01:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
back room there's room to do that I
 
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
would make sure you put your name on it
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
or one of your business cards and and so
 
01:49:33.050 --> 01:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
you know whose is whose uh and uh
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
and we'll be we'll be able to uh
 
01:49:38.810 --> 01:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
reference that at our meetings uh and
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
you won't you won't have to uh drag it
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
with you from home every time you come
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
to one of these meetings
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
all right the the uh the last thing I
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh talk about before we go to
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.930 --> 01:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
is it David is uh are you attorney
 
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
eloconus no no I am not okay I just want
 
01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:04.980 align:start position:0%
to get the titles right you mentioned
 
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:07.580 align:start position:0%
that 45 bills
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
were uh came in that created or adjusted
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
Commissions in the most recent session
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
can you give us a breakdown where they
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
come from the senate or the house or I I
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
can't then that information is about two
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
weeks old now uh
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'd have to do more research on that
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
because as you heard from uh Deborah
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
I literally have to search by the term
 
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
commission committee uh to get a list
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
and then uh so I'd have to do additional
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
and additional research one last
 
01:50:43.490 --> 01:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
question before lunch is
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:46.129 align:start position:0%
we talked about
um

01:50:46.129 --> 01:50:46.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
many commissions are being attached
 
01:50:51.169 --> 01:50:51.179 align:start position:0%
being attached to executive
 
01:50:51.179 --> 01:50:52.430 align:start position:0%
being attached to executive
uh

01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:53.810 align:start position:0%
uh
staff

01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
or follow-up is it does that have a
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
Governor's implication or to uh Mr
 
01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:02.699 align:start position:0%
chairman that that's part of the Senate
 
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 84 provision that is now before the
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
house in legislative Administration and
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
I would just note that representative
 
01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:12.179 align:start position:0%
Sheehan and representative wall are both
 
01:51:14.810 --> 01:51:14.820 align:start position:0%
on legislative Administration and that
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
bill has been scheduled for a public
 
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
hearing and I'm sure that you will
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
expect a couple of us to be there
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
testifying okay thank you thank you
 
01:51:25.609 --> 01:51:25.619 align:start position:0%
all right well with that being said why
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't we uh why don't we break for lunch
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
and be back here at uh at one o'clock
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
and we'll uh we'll finish up and just
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
hide some of the methodology going
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
forward of how we're going to kind of
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
slice this up and and try to digest
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
these big bites of information that we
 
01:51:47.810 --> 01:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
have in front of us and I'll rely on
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative evil to help us
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
because she's been through this before
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
and been tortured once twice already so
 
01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.910 align:start position:0%
and been tortured once twice already so
uh

01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
with with that thank you all for coming
 
01:51:59.870 --> 01:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful and very
 
01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:01.490 align:start position:0%
it's been very helpful and very
educational

01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
educational
 
01:52:20.450 --> 01:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:21.969 --> 03:05:21.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.370 --> 03:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
all right if you guys could uh break out
 
03:05:28.969 --> 03:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
your calendars and let's do a
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
a calendar check of when we think it's
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
the least painful for us to meet going
 
03:05:34.319 --> 03:05:37.130 align:start position:0%
the least painful for us to meet going
forward

03:05:37.130 --> 03:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.140 --> 03:05:38.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:05:38.110 --> 03:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:41.150 --> 03:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'm cognizant of the April vacation
 
03:05:43.969 --> 03:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
which is the the 24th to the 28th was
 
03:05:48.650 --> 03:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
and just in general how do you feel
 
03:05:51.420 --> 03:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
and just in general how do you feel
about

03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh which day of the week you want to
 
03:05:56.630 --> 03:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
meet you like Mondays you like
 
03:05:58.910 --> 03:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
Fridays uh someone said they didn't like
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
Friday no Fridays no Friday
 
03:06:04.910 --> 03:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
Monday's good for you
 
03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:07.730 align:start position:0%
Monday's good for you
transportation

03:06:07.730 --> 03:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:11.389 --> 03:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so Monday seems like the least
 
03:06:17.090 --> 03:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
the least uh disruptive Monday mornings
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
or afternoons or either one
 
03:06:22.130 --> 03:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
you like morning
 
03:06:23.690 --> 03:06:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'll be late
 
03:06:26.510 --> 03:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
I have first Monday of every month I
 
03:06:27.889 --> 03:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
have an appointment
 
03:06:31.309 --> 03:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
so other than that I'll be here
 
03:06:31.319 --> 03:06:35.210 align:start position:0%
so other than that I'll be here
and

03:06:35.210 --> 03:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:37.969 --> 03:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that uh
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
the way we might attack this
 
03:06:43.610 --> 03:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
is the way of a regular committee would
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
attack things like this with
 
03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:47.210 align:start position:0%
attack things like this with
subcommittees

03:06:47.210 --> 03:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
03:06:50.750 --> 03:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh maybe what we do is
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
we get the the list of all the different
 
03:06:53.279 --> 03:06:55.490 align:start position:0%
we get the the list of all the different
commissions

03:06:55.490 --> 03:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
03:06:58.610 --> 03:06:58.620 align:start position:0%
we cut them up into groups and then a
 
03:07:01.250 --> 03:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
sub a subcommittee could attack these 20
 
03:07:03.170 --> 03:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
commissions another great track leads to
 
03:07:05.809 --> 03:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
Lincoln and then we come back together
 
03:07:08.929 --> 03:07:08.939 align:start position:0%
and and reveal what we've
 
03:07:11.530 --> 03:07:11.540 align:start position:0%
decided or learned during that
 
03:07:14.690 --> 03:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
subcommittee activity the other thing is
 
03:07:18.670 --> 03:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a subcommittee to attack processed
 
03:07:21.170 --> 03:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know what what what's the right way
 
03:07:24.230 --> 03:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
what's the language that ought to be in
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
that goes to OLS as a standard template
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
when some When A legislature brings
 
03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
forth an idea to create a commission or
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
03:07:36.590 --> 03:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
to OLS OLS should be able to pull out of
 
03:07:38.809 --> 03:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
their bag of tricks well here's the
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
here's the template that we want you to
 
03:07:43.250 --> 03:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
use that we'd like you to use for that
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
and that would steer
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
the legislator in a certain direction
 
03:07:50.990 --> 03:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
with hopefully with the with the help of
 
03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:52.610 align:start position:0%
with hopefully with the with the help of
their

03:07:52.610 --> 03:07:52.620 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:54.290 align:start position:0%
their
caucus

03:07:54.290 --> 03:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
the office and as well as the committee
 
03:07:59.809 --> 03:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
chair say if you're going to do that in
 
03:08:02.269 --> 03:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
this committee or in this caucus we'd
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
like you to kind of go in this direction
 
03:08:07.250 --> 03:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
but without tying their hands but at
 
03:08:10.250 --> 03:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
least encouraging certain behaviors or
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
certain activities
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
so that might be a subcommittee you know
 
03:08:17.210 --> 03:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
on language and process
 
03:08:17.220 --> 03:08:18.650 align:start position:0%
on language and process
and

03:08:18.650 --> 03:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:20.450 --> 03:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
a couple other subcommunities on
 
03:08:23.690 --> 03:08:23.700 align:start position:0%
commissions themselves
 
03:08:27.530 --> 03:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I think what I'd like to say and
 
03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
for for give the use of language but
 
03:08:33.410 --> 03:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
there are certain sacred cows
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to run into I think in
 
03:08:37.610 --> 03:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
this in this process
 
03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it's my thought that we have enough
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
of a huge elephant to attack that I
 
03:08:47.570 --> 03:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
think we can skip the sacred cows push
 
03:08:50.690 --> 03:08:50.700 align:start position:0%
them aside and leave them alone and
 
03:08:52.990 --> 03:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
we'll still have plenty to do
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
so if so if some of us individually or
 
03:09:00.530 --> 03:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
collectively based on inputs from our
 
03:09:02.809 --> 03:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
respective caucuses saying this is a
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
very important commission that needs to
 
03:09:07.790 --> 03:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
keep going or needs to be supported or
 
03:09:09.950 --> 03:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be encouraged
 
03:09:12.230 --> 03:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll just let's just take a
 
03:09:15.230 --> 03:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
hands-off approach to it and
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
treat it as a sacred cows and that's
 
03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
important to the Democratic caucus or
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Republican caucus or whatever so
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to mess with it we've
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
got 400 opportunities
 
03:09:28.849 --> 03:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
that will probably
 
03:09:31.309 --> 03:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
not going to get too deep into that as
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
it is so my thought is let's attack
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
those things that we can come to easy
 
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
agreement on and not fight about the the
 
03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
ones that are so-called sacred cows that
 
03:09:48.769 --> 03:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:50.450 --> 03:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
first right
 
03:09:55.330 --> 03:09:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.050 --> 03:09:59.060 align:start position:0%
the purpose to Define what
 
03:09:59.060 --> 03:10:01.210 align:start position:0%
the purpose to Define what
is

03:10:01.210 --> 03:10:01.220 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:10:03.889 --> 03:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
and why people prefer Australia
 
03:10:06.170 --> 03:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
committees if needed local clinicians
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
because commissions take their agency
 
03:10:11.210 --> 03:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
the department preparation of employers
 
03:10:14.450 --> 03:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
out of their jobs and it's lost on their
 
03:10:14.460 --> 03:10:20.230 align:start position:0%
out of their jobs and it's lost on their
work

03:10:20.230 --> 03:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
I remember when there was a particular
 
03:10:24.830 --> 03:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
chairman of
 
03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:26.150 align:start position:0%
chairman of
um resources

03:10:26.150 --> 03:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
um resources
 
03:10:29.690 --> 03:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
who what helps the permissions for that
 
03:10:35.290 --> 03:10:35.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.130 --> 03:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:44.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:10:44.210 --> 03:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:46.730 --> 03:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
um those people can come in and tell us
 
03:10:46.740 --> 03:10:49.490 align:start position:0%
um those people can come in and tell us
tomorrow

03:10:49.490 --> 03:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:51.650 --> 03:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
as they vote on a position
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:10:53.880 --> 03:10:54.710 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:58.670 --> 03:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
what we can do is uh
 
03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:00.660 align:start position:0%

03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
jumps into the middle of lunch but
 
03:12:01.969 --> 03:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
if we just said that we we'd end it
 
03:12:04.010 --> 03:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
time a non-break for lunch enough to

03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%

well

03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
you you think about May 1st if you can't
 
03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:28.250 --> 03:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:30.830 --> 03:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the ten to one
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
unless unless
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
someone wants to change that 9 to 12 or
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 to 12 you know a lot of this if
 
03:13:44.450 --> 03:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to be off in subcommittee
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
formats I mean you could do a meeting
 
03:13:51.309 --> 03:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
on on a Wednesday with two other people
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
03:13:56.269 --> 03:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
electronically or half half and half I I
 
03:13:58.849 --> 03:13:58.859 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll have any restriction
 
03:13:58.859 --> 03:14:00.650 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll have any restriction
uh

03:14:00.650 --> 03:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:02.929 --> 03:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
whether whether we do you don't like
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:12.889 --> 03:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
uh no no Zoom subcommittees you think
 
03:14:17.809 --> 03:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.610 --> 03:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
I know he I know he hates the zoom
 
03:14:19.620 --> 03:14:22.910 align:start position:0%
I know he I know he hates the zoom
meetings

03:14:22.910 --> 03:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
well subcommittees can meet
 
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know because we don't have to
 
03:14:28.490 --> 03:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
announce a subcommittee right
 
03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittees can you can meet at any
 
03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:31.790 align:start position:0%
subcommittees can you can meet at any
time

03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we can figure out what day we will
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
whoever the subcommittee chair is you
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
can decide how you want to meet or where
 
03:14:38.929 --> 03:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
you want to meet whether you want to
 
03:14:38.939 --> 03:14:39.710 align:start position:0%
you want to meet whether you want to
meet

03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:14:43.130 --> 03:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
at a local restaurant or a McDonald's or
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
here or whatever I think the
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees do need to be noticed you
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
think so no committee still yeah
 
03:14:53.450 --> 03:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
all right I'll find I'll find out yeah
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I think they do but but we can
 
03:14:56.990 --> 03:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
figure it out
 
03:14:58.550 --> 03:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee and figure out we
 
03:14:59.809 --> 03:14:59.819 align:start position:0%
don't have to meet from the same day as
 
03:15:01.849 --> 03:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
the committee correct correct but I
 
03:15:03.969 --> 03:15:03.979 align:start position:0%
those subcommittee meetings
 
03:15:07.150 --> 03:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
you're right I know I just
 
03:15:09.530 --> 03:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
I mean I like the idea of meeting at a
 
03:15:14.830 --> 03:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm personally going to be in Spain
 
03:15:20.990 --> 03:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
the week of May 8th
 
03:15:24.769 --> 03:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
so that's that's me in India right so
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to zoom in from Spain
 
03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:31.070 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to zoom in from Spain
tormolinos

03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:33.950 --> 03:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
hey I did tdys to Terre honed but I I do
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
have advice here and he can uh
 
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
cheer for me if that happens if if
 
03:15:41.210 --> 03:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
that's a conflict
 
03:15:44.809 --> 03:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
uh so let's let let's just plan on the
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.150 --> 03:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
51

03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
51
 
03:16:00.050 --> 03:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
and 5 8. that uh reasonable and that'll
 
03:16:03.130 --> 03:16:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
in 104. right in in room 104 do you guys
 
03:16:11.330 --> 03:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:14.870 --> 03:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
behind us right behind the keyboard
 
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.050 --> 03:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a much smaller room than
 
03:16:21.060 --> 03:16:22.130 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a much smaller room than
this

03:16:22.130 --> 03:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that's why we didn't have it there
 
03:16:27.889 --> 03:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
today because with uh with the panel we
 
03:16:30.730 --> 03:16:30.740 align:start position:0%
had we wouldn't have had enough room
 
03:16:33.889 --> 03:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
and in the back of the room
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
this uh there's places for you to put
 
03:16:40.130 --> 03:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
your stuff your notebooks or anything
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
any paraphernalia you want to come and
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
leave it in there
 
03:16:44.700 --> 03:16:45.969 align:start position:0%
leave it in there
yeah

03:16:45.969 --> 03:16:45.979 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:16:48.429 --> 03:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
well if if
 
03:16:50.750 --> 03:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'll either assure that's unlocked or
 
03:16:54.410 --> 03:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
the vice chair will and it all uh
 
03:16:57.349 --> 03:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
in a panic mode the guard that's sitting
 
03:16:58.730 --> 03:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
at that desk and come around and unlock
 
03:16:58.740 --> 03:17:02.510 align:start position:0%
at that desk and come around and unlock
it

03:17:02.510 --> 03:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:05.389 --> 03:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
I've I've asked for a special key for
 
03:17:07.250 --> 03:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
myself but I don't I haven't got it yet
 
03:17:10.610 --> 03:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
so but the guard's not too far away to
 
03:17:13.130 --> 03:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
unlock it
 
03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:14.269 align:start position:0%
unlock it
um

03:17:14.269 --> 03:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:17.210 --> 03:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
and then uh we'll see how that goes and
 
03:17:18.230 --> 03:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
then we'll
 
03:17:22.370 --> 03:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
see how we uh want to continue our dates
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
after that makes sense and Nick and at
 
03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
the next meeting our agenda uh informal
 
03:17:32.210 --> 03:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
agenda for our meeting on the
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh on the 17th
 
03:17:39.950 --> 03:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
let's see here on the 17th yeah will be
 
03:17:39.960 --> 03:17:41.510 align:start position:0%
let's see here on the 17th yeah will be
uh

03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:43.490 --> 03:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
to decide how we want to split up into
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittees what makes sense so what
 
03:17:48.670 --> 03:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
you if you have a certain hunger for
 
03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
process or whatever and you want to work
 
03:17:53.690 --> 03:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
on the process part of this with with
 
03:17:56.690 --> 03:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
OLS that would draw you in that
 
03:17:58.250 --> 03:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
direction or if you decide you know I
 
03:17:59.389 --> 03:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
just wanna
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
okay let's get after the commissions
 
03:18:04.730 --> 03:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
themselves you can do that too so so I
 
03:18:07.190 --> 03:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
would ask you to come prepared to decide
 
03:18:11.269 --> 03:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.969 --> 03:18:12.979 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
it needs a sense of specifically what we
 
03:18:20.090 --> 03:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
need to recovery so we can decide well
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
part of that I'm hoping that you'll help
 
03:18:25.849 --> 03:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
with given your experience and Karen
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
people's experience uh
 
03:18:32.389 --> 03:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
things like what is help with
 
03:18:34.429 --> 03:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
definitions what is a commission what is
 
03:18:36.230 --> 03:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
it study committee what is a full
 
03:18:40.190 --> 03:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
committee and and and lay that out
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
so that not only will be on the same
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
sheet of music but it's maybe something
 
03:18:47.450 --> 03:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
we could provide with the new freshman
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:54.889 --> 03:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that would be good
 
03:18:58.910 --> 03:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
well at least think about it so that you
 
03:19:00.830 --> 03:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
can decide you know if if you want to be
 
03:19:02.570 --> 03:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
on a process
 
03:19:04.849 --> 03:19:04.859 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that that would be
 
03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
something you certainly would would take
 
03:19:07.020 --> 03:19:08.570 align:start position:0%
something you certainly would would take
on

03:19:08.570 --> 03:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:19:24.530 --> 03:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:24.540 --> 03:19:26.510 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

03:19:26.510 --> 03:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
what a concept
 
03:19:41.870 --> 03:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
well I think with that also it just
 
03:19:48.230 --> 03:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
brought to mind we ought to all read and
 
03:19:51.610 --> 03:19:51.620 align:start position:0%
study a little bit RSA 14
 
03:19:55.730 --> 03:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
9. so we know what what that says
 
03:19:57.950 --> 03:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
because that's kind of the governing
 
03:20:02.330 --> 03:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh rules for how how we how these things
 
03:20:04.910 --> 03:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
should behave and and plus we get Senate
 
03:20:07.730 --> 03:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
bill is it 84 that's coming up
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think 84. I don't think we
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
need to study that so much yeah we're
 
03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to hijack that anyway but one of
 
03:20:15.769 --> 03:20:15.779 align:start position:0%
the thoughts
 
03:20:15.779 --> 03:20:16.910 align:start position:0%
the thoughts
uh

03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
about how we go for that and John why
 
03:20:20.809 --> 03:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
don't you mention what your thought was
 
03:20:24.230 --> 03:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
on that what are you for yeah all right
 
03:20:27.230 --> 03:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
um when I was thinking and I kind of
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to the speakers we were
 
03:20:34.190 --> 03:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
walking to lunch is SB 84 is in
 
03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
your committee and to retain it
 
03:20:45.650 --> 03:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
for now and then we as the committee
 
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
put the put it put a new SB 84 together
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
with all the things that come out of our
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
our commission right here out of our
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee oh my God Commission
 
03:20:58.730 --> 03:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh and what we want to see in in 84
 
03:21:01.429 --> 03:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
basically got it and rebuild it the way
 
03:21:04.190 --> 03:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
we want to see it because we can't I
 
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
mean Senate hijacks our bills so
 
03:21:08.750 --> 03:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
turnabouts fair play
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
so let's be ready for you okay well you
 
03:21:15.290 --> 03:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.170 --> 03:21:18.180 align:start position:0%
yeah or yeah so so the the immediate
 
03:21:20.630 --> 03:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
action would be to convince the the
 
03:21:22.849 --> 03:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
chair and the committee members to
 
03:21:22.859 --> 03:21:23.870 align:start position:0%
chair and the committee members to
retain

03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
retain
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
retain SB 84 so that would give us an
 
03:21:30.050 --> 03:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to play with it rather
 
03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's in this it comes out of the Senate
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't know
 
03:21:39.650 --> 03:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
the sponsors are
 
03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
or like you said yes Janet's the ranking
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
member of the uh
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
or you're the ranking member right or
 
03:21:47.520 --> 03:21:48.950 align:start position:0%
or you're the ranking member right or
Legend

03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
Legend
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:21:52.370 --> 03:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
another task for you take a look at that
 
03:21:54.349 --> 03:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
and find out who the sponsors are and
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
What needs how what's what's the
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
likelihood of of them voting to retain
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
and then we and then we also get the uh
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
who's uh the speaker working on it too
 
03:22:09.290 --> 03:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
who's chair all right Greg
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
that's a piece of cake so you and Grace
 
03:22:13.849 --> 03:22:13.859 align:start position:0%
piece of cake need to Marshall that over
 
03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
to a pain motion they can retain it easy
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
she got she got three members right
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
there I'm trying to convince Greg to
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but let's I think for us all to
 
03:22:29.990 --> 03:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
look into it and and then be able to
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
talk about it right yeah you know next
 
03:22:33.650 --> 03:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
time we meet yeah yeah because that's
 
03:22:34.969 --> 03:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do is figure
 
03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
out what we want to do and next meeting
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it having a little a
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of research so uh so I'd like
 
03:22:43.490 --> 03:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
to ask you also take a look at your
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
calendars again
 
03:22:47.330 --> 03:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
so when you when we come back again on
 
03:22:50.090 --> 03:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
the uh on the 17th you come back with
 
03:22:52.610 --> 03:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
what the dates going forward are I I
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
hope we're not working over the summer
 
03:22:57.769 --> 03:22:57.779 align:start position:0%
but at least take this look at the
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
calendar taking us into June let's you
 
03:23:01.130 --> 03:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
know look at it to the end of the
 
03:23:03.650 --> 03:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
session when we would normally uh end
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
this session end of June so between now
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
and the end of June what other are there
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
any dates
 
03:23:13.729 --> 03:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
that are bad for you that you'd like to
 
03:23:15.710 --> 03:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
exclude from consideration otherwise
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll stay on this uh Monday
 
03:23:20.210 --> 03:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
Memorial Day is not going to work well
 
03:23:22.849 --> 03:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
because that's a Monday right so that by
 
03:23:28.190 --> 03:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.650 --> 03:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
yeah representative I was wondering when
 
03:23:32.330 --> 03:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the subcommittees
 
03:23:32.340 --> 03:23:33.530 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the subcommittees
possibly

03:23:33.530 --> 03:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
possibly
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be thinking ahead for next week
 
03:23:36.239 --> 03:23:37.370 align:start position:0%
to be thinking ahead for next week
um

03:23:37.370 --> 03:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
so you're imagining like a process-based
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee every time and then you
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
want us to be thinking about
 
03:23:44.210 --> 03:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
for the other companies you know taking
 
03:23:47.870 --> 03:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
20 existing and basically vetting them
 
03:23:49.070 --> 03:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
for whether it's overlap where there's
 
03:23:50.990 --> 03:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
redundancies is that unless it's a
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
better way yeah no I just want to make
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
sure I understand because where I want
 
03:23:55.370 --> 03:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
to think about putting my energy for
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
those so okay yeah we're making our own
 
03:23:57.120 --> 03:23:58.510 align:start position:0%
those so okay yeah we're making our own
rules

03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:24:00.769 --> 03:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
and then we can figure out how we want
 
03:24:02.570 --> 03:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
to do it yeah
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and and like I said I'd like to and
 
03:24:07.490 --> 03:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's okay for us to
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
identify those so-called sacred cows
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and put and put a fence around them
 
03:24:16.610 --> 03:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
and let's just you know this one you
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
know this one's really important to Matt
 
03:24:21.290 --> 03:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
and he's he's got to have this
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
commission and he really wants it to go
 
03:24:26.990 --> 03:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
forward and we need to work on it
 
03:24:29.510 --> 03:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
so let's not mess with it let's let's I
 
03:24:31.250 --> 03:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
like the idea of a template or a
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
checklist kind of you know going forward
 
03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
if someone's considering requesting that
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
you know you should have a Sunset date
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
in there you should have never remember
 
03:24:40.250 --> 03:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
usually you know so the guard rails that
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
we want people to think about right
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
place would be really helpful I think
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
right and
 
03:24:48.110 --> 03:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
I know it didn't get a good read from
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
the panel but I I'm not ready to let go
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the the thought also of putting a
 
03:24:55.670 --> 03:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
little more responsibility on committee
 
03:24:55.680 --> 03:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
little more responsibility on committee
chairs

03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
03:24:58.790 --> 03:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
to say if you if
 
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
that if we took the commissions and
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
mapped them all into committee chairs
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
and said you're a committee chair you
 
03:25:07.849 --> 03:25:07.859 align:start position:0%
get these 27 commissions
 
03:25:10.190 --> 03:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
and you need to need to look up look
 
03:25:11.809 --> 03:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
over the over the shoulder of these
 
03:25:14.090 --> 03:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
commissions and decide you know are they
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction do they
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
need help do they need
 
03:25:19.729 --> 03:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
to be killed or to be encouraged or
 
03:25:22.729 --> 03:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
whatever the action is that I think I
 
03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
personally I think we let the cheers off
 
03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
too easily on those commissions well it
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like yes at the end of the day
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
they can't necessarily you know strike
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
anything down or whatever but to just
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
sort of have the oversight or the the
 
03:25:36.290 --> 03:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
guidance of someone following up with
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
these but you're saying where things
 
03:25:40.190 --> 03:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
stand or well maybe we should even be
 
03:25:42.170 --> 03:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
going forward even in the in the process
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
mentality yeah uh that if
 
03:25:50.090 --> 03:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
the the members of a committee want a
 
03:25:53.090 --> 03:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
commission are considering a bill and
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about tipping it in the
 
03:25:56.690 --> 03:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
direction of a committee or commission
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
that the chair should have some guidance
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
for them saying yeah you know we really
 
03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
don't want to add another commission
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can work it out with a
 
03:26:09.170 --> 03:26:09.180 align:start position:0%
subcommittee right here now and not add
 
03:26:11.570 --> 03:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
it to the to the uh to the bureaucracy
 
03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
of a commission I feel like At first
 
03:26:15.110 --> 03:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
sorry the last thought I feel like At
 
03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
first blush it doesn't seem unreasonable
 
03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
to you to you know request if somebody
 
03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
decides their Bill's not going to get
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
through and they're going to ask for a
 
03:26:24.050 --> 03:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
commission that they'd have to serve on
 
03:26:25.969 --> 03:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
that commission right potentially I know
 
03:26:27.889 --> 03:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
that came up for discussion or not even
 
03:26:30.290 --> 03:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
just the study committee and I I also
 
03:26:31.849 --> 03:26:31.859 align:start position:0%
wonder as I guess I'm probably the
 
03:26:34.010 --> 03:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
newest legislator at this table I
 
03:26:36.889 --> 03:26:36.899 align:start position:0%
imagine if if newer elected reps
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
understood that they might be expected
 
03:26:40.490 --> 03:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
to serve on committees or commissions I
 
03:26:41.809 --> 03:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
don't think that's entirely clear or
 
03:26:43.130 --> 03:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
expected right now and that might give
 
03:26:45.170 --> 03:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
people a reason to think more I think
 
03:26:45.180 --> 03:26:48.849 align:start position:0%
people a reason to think more I think
expectations

03:26:48.849 --> 03:26:48.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.410 --> 03:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh
 
03:26:57.170 --> 03:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
let's go to we'll go to you now I I
 
03:26:58.670 --> 03:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
really lost my train of thought that's
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
I think when
 
03:27:05.809 --> 03:27:05.819 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the chairs you know
 
03:27:08.210 --> 03:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
authority to be able to establish a
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or a working group or
 
03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
whatever it is within the committee
 
03:27:14.570 --> 03:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
structure I like that a lot I also
 
03:27:18.349 --> 03:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
um am concerned about uh some issues
 
03:27:20.929 --> 03:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
actually getting
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know the chair to sign off on it and
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
say yes this is something that's
 
03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
important so I think as we think about
 
03:27:29.450 --> 03:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking out for my my friends
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the aisle because I
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
know you'll be in the minority in 2024
 
03:27:35.690 --> 03:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
and so just how do we how do we retain
 
03:27:38.030 --> 03:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
the ability right to for the minorities
 
03:27:39.769 --> 03:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
you have to be non-political right
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
that's exactly it well and so it's like
 
03:27:43.130 --> 03:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
so is it is it thinking about the
 
03:27:45.050 --> 03:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
ranking member and their their ability
 
03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
to you know say hey this is something
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
that you know should get some uh some
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
attention but we don't need to create a
 
03:27:52.969 --> 03:27:52.979 align:start position:0%
study committee or a study Commission on
 
03:27:52.979 --> 03:27:54.229 align:start position:0%
study committee or a study Commission on
this

03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:27:55.849 --> 03:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
um that could be helpful I also think
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
and I was I mentioned this to the
 
03:27:59.570 --> 03:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
speaker in the hallway earlier you know
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
it could be that
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the mechanism would be
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
it could be a resolution that the house
 
03:28:06.530 --> 03:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
passes because they may not get the
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
majority of folks on that committee to
 
03:28:09.889 --> 03:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
say yes this is important but they could
 
03:28:11.570 --> 03:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
get the votes on the floor of the house
 
03:28:13.969 --> 03:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
it could be a resolution to say hey
 
03:28:17.450 --> 03:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're gonna uh ask the education
 
03:28:20.210 --> 03:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
committee to study
 
03:28:22.429 --> 03:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
um you know higher ed some some
 
03:28:25.250 --> 03:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
particular topic and then that that's
 
03:28:27.290 --> 03:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's the voice of the entire chamber
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
saying yes this is something that uh
 
03:28:31.969 --> 03:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
should should be uh followed up on there
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
should be action taken to study great
 
03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
idea yeah
 
03:28:38.809 --> 03:28:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay that's good sounds good any input
 
03:28:50.450 --> 03:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:50.460 --> 03:28:53.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:59.570 --> 03:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:03.889 --> 03:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay and it looked like we were just
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
looking at the um here it is at the
 
03:29:14.690 --> 03:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:17.630 --> 03:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
that was the center here great okay so
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%

03:29:18.899 --> 03:29:22.130 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been scheduled yet in light
Jasmine
