1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The time being 930, I would call to order the public hearing on House Bill 1038, an act naming a bridge in Londonderry in honor of Robert J.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Prowse.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I would call on the sponsor, Representative Woods, to speak about the bill.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you, Mr.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Chair, and thank you, Committee, for allowing me to present this.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:50,000
I am Gary Woods, Merrimack 23, representing Bowen Dunbarton, and I'm here to introduce House Bill 1038, Naming a Bridge in Londonderry, in Honor of Robert J.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Prouse.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Just for those of you who may not know where that bridge is, it's on 93, just north of exit 4.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:11,500
That bridge that was there has been called by the locals, as I understand, the Ash Street Bridge.

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:18,000
And it actually is right almost on the line between Londonderry and Derry.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It is in Londonderry.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,500
But it's a conduit between the two.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,500
That bridge was already named the Robert J.

17
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Prowse Bridge.

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:46,000
However, because of the 93 renovation, it was taken down and preserved actually and put up for bid and Keene bought it and will use it as a footbridge where I'm not sure.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't think at this point it's up and running, shall we say, but it is going to be used.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,500
The new bridge is obviously functional after the renovation of I-93.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:12,500
And that brings us to the question, why am I sitting here representing Bowen Dunbarton, sponsoring a bill for something in Londonderry?

22
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Not it'll come together.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:29,500
It turns out the family lives in Concord, in Bow, and they reached out to the family and they, quote, the department proposes naming the new bridge the Robert J.

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Prouse Bridge to continue to honor Robert Prouse if the family is amenable.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,500
At that juncture, they identified to Joyce Prouse, the daughter-in-law of Robert J.

26
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,000
Prouse, that the department can't do that.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That has to go through the legislative process.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And she says, aha, my next-door neighbor is a representative.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll talk to him.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That in addition to the fact that I'm a retired orthopedic surgeon and I've taken care of individuals in the family for somewhere between 30 and 40 years.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So besides being my next door neighbor, I've known from the medical area, and thus I was asked to see if I could bring this forward.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The bridge itself currently is not the exact same design, but the department felt that they wanted to at least keep a bridge named for him.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,500
I have a summary, and I'll leave this and you can read it, regarding him.

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
He was born in Concord, lived from 06 to 1969.

35
00:03:49,500 --> 00:04:06,500
He served in World War II, was an engineer from the start and worked his way up through the department and was key in developing the change in bridge design from riveting to welding.

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:20,500
In that process, he ended up personally designed no fewer than 180 New Hampshire highway bridges and was the administrator overseeing the design of more than 400 bridges.

37
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Again, this was very innovative and got national recognition.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:43,500
And that placed New Hampshire at the forefront of the application of welded girder technology, which became the dominant technology for the fabrication of steel bridges, steel bridges members in the latter half of the 20th century.

39
00:04:43,500 --> 00:05:01,500
So we have a conquered individual who has gained national recognition, and the department as well as the family would very much like to continue to honor his memory by naming that bridge the Robert J.

40
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Prowse Bridge.

41
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,000
And I'll leave this and this gives a little bit more.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:25,500
This is from a biography that is in the Department of Transportation and the daughter-in-law, my neighbor, excerpted a few comments from that to help you understand who he was as a person.

43
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I'll take any questions.

44
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Questions from the committee?

45
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Representative Puget.

46
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Yes, thank you.

47
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I just wondered if this had been brought before the Londonderry Town Government for their approval.

48
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, I did, in fact, contact both.

49
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,500
I forgot to mention that.

50
00:05:47,500 --> 00:06:26,500
I contacted both managers and asked if they had any, they would like to provide any input or they had anything that would take precedence as it would be locally if that would be the case and both indicated that they did not, which raises a question that I have for you folks is, is there any other documentation relative to this that I need to bring forward to either verify that or any other documentation that's needed?

51
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Go ahead, continue.

52
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Thank you, Mr.

53
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Chairman.

54
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Yes, I think that it's been traditional that we have some kind of written documentation from the municipal.

55
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,500
From each, although it's in Londonderry, you would like one from Derry as well?

56
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I'll answer that.

57
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,500
If it's physically in Londonderry, something from the town of Londonderry will be sufficient.

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:13,000
And the reason we do this is we have run into problems in the past where we have tried to name something unbeknownst to the town, and they were not happy.

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,500
Not necessarily disagreeing, but we're not happy that the legislature were just running over their bridges and the rest.

60
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
There we go.

61
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,500
That should be addressed to you as chair?

62
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, that would be sufficient.

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Thank you for that input.

64
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Other questions?

65
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

66
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
I see a member from DOT here.

67
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,500
I do have a question.

68
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:51,000
You didn't think you were going to get off that easy, did you?

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Good morning, Mr.

70
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,500
Chair, members of the committee.

71
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Kathy Mulcahy-Hampson, Senior Hearings Examiner and Legislative Liaison for New Hampshire Department of Transportation.

72
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:17,500
The previous speaker talked about that the department was in favor of this naming of the bridge, and that there had been a bridge that was already named for him.

73
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,000
Could you walk us through, is it in the same place?

74
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:36,500
Do we really need to rename something that's been named before, or can we just say it's just a replacement bridge and the name stays the same?

75
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Thank you, Mr.

76
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Chairman.

77
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:51,500
The department does not take positions on naming bills, but we do help to facilitate when bills want to be brought forward.

78
00:08:51,500 --> 00:09:02,000
And the family members had contacted the department, and we advised them how to proceed with the process of this legislation.

79
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The prior Ash Street Bridge was removed as part of the I-93 project and it was purchased by the City of Keene and is going to be moved to Keene and made part of a historic trail project.

80
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
It was named after Mr.

81
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,000
Prowse because it was a unique design on the bridge that he designed.

82
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,500
So the name stays with the old bridge, and the new bridge would need to be named.

83
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Thank you.

84
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,000
Any questions of the Department from members?

85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Representative Faulkner.

86
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Thank you.

87
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,500
Any questions of the department from members?

88
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Representative Faulkner.

89
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,000
My understanding is that Keene doesn't like to name its bridges.

90
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,500
Are they getting an indication that they would keep the same name for that bridge?

91
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you for the question.

92
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We haven't had any conversations with the City of Keene on that, Representative Faulkner.

93
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Thank you for the question.

94
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:25,500
We haven't had any conversations with the City of Keene on that, Representative Faulkner.

95
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Thank you.

96
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Thank you.

97
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Seeing no other questions, thank you very much for trying to clarify some of this.

98
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have no other pink cards on House Bill 1038, naming a bridge in Londonderry in honor of Robert J.

99
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Prouse.

100
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Is there anybody who has not testified who wishes to testify?

101
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Anybody who wishes to testify a second time?

102
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Seeing none, public hearing on House Bill 1038 is closed.

103
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:28,000
I had planned on doing the executive session on this, but it has been the longstanding tradition of this committee that we have something in writing from the town, and I would like to keep with that tradition so we will have to hold off on the executive session.

104
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,500
But before I do, just a quick straw poll.

105
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,000
Is there anybody opposed to this bill?

106
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Seeing no hands, the exec session will be very short once we get that piece of paper.

107
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:57,500
That being said, our next bill, I thought we'd spend a few minutes on the exec session, but our next bill is not until 10 a.m.

108
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,000
It is House Bill 1456 relative to the Hampton Marine Memorial.

109
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
We are on break until 10 a.m.

110
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Thank you.

111
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Thank you.

112
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Thank you.

113
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Thank you.

114
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
Thank you.

115
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Thank you.

116
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Thank you.

117
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Thank you.

118
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Thank you.

119
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Thank you.

120
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Thank you.

121
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Thank you.

122
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Thank you.

123
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Thank you.

124
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Thank you.

125
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Thank you.

126
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Thank you.

127
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Thank you.

128
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
All right.

129
00:12:44,500 --> 00:13:07,000
I was just going to say, can everyone make sure they speak closely to the mic sue and i are right by the the like thing and so it's very hard to hear that is helpful and that's why there are mics at every station.

130
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,500
As you probably looking at the bill and the next one, I am a co-sponsor of both of them.

131
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:23,500
And the vice chairman will be running the hearings on both of those bills.

132
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Yes.

133
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Well, we're doing one, one at a time.

134
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:38,500
The time being 10 o'clock, we will open up House Bill 1456, relative to the Hampton Marine Memorial.

135
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,000
And we will recognize the prime sponsor, Representative Edgar.

136
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Please.

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you, Mr.

138
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Chairman.

139
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,500
Again, for the record, my name is Mike Edgar.

140
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm a representative representing Hampton.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The amendment addresses the change effective date from 60 days after its passage to taking effect upon passage.

142
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:19,500
so what we have here is we have the bill HB 1456 and also the amendment 2022 0039H you should have a copy of the amendment at your desk.

143
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
The Hampton Marine Memorial is a state memorial.

144
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,000
That's why we're dealing with it today.

145
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:42,500
It's located, for those that don't know about it, it's located in Hampton on Ocean Boulevard, pretty much across from Ashworth by the sea, and that's at basically 295 Ocean Boulevard.

146
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:54,500
The Hampton Marine Memorial was created in 1957 to provide a place for those buried or lost at sea so they could be recognized.

147
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,500
It depicts a gold star mother laying a wreath upon the sea.

148
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:18,000
Most of the names on the memorial, those from basically service members and merchant marine service members who were lost at sea during World War II, that's the bulk of the names on the memorial.

149
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:30,000
In 1990, the eligibility requirements was extended to include those mentioned, Richard Marine members that I just mentioned, and those of the Vietnam conflict.

150
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:41,500
HB 1456 extends the eligibility period to include Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and the wars on terrorism following the September 11th attack.

151
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Burke Bennett, American Legion Commander, Post 35, is present and will be speaking and provide more details concerning the monument.

152
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I must admit that I do have a personal interest in this.

153
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,500
A neighbor of mine, Jonathan Currier, was lost at sea.

154
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:15,500
He was a corporal in the United States Marine Corps, and he was lost at sea on August 9, 2018, off the coast of the Philippines.

155
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,000
Please consider the amendment that I mentioned and the Unlion bill.

156
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,500
So I don't think if there are any questions.

157
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,000
Are there any questions for the representative?

158
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Seeing none, thank you.

159
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I would like to call on Berkley Bennett, if I could please.

160
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Please come forward.

161
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,500
Sir, welcome to Public Works, and please introduce yourself.

162
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Well, good morning.

163
00:16:45,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Chairman Graham, I would like to thank you and the members of the committee for the opportunity to speak in favor of HB 1456, which would include recent conflicts and allow additional names to be added to the Hampton Marine Memorial at Hampton Beach.

164
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,500
My name is Berkeley Bennett, and I'm the commander of American Legion Post 35 in Hampton.

165
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:25,500
As a bit of background, as Representative Edgar mentioned, the idea for a memorial came from Manchester resident William E.

166
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Downs.

167
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
His son, Army Captain William D.

168
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Downs, had died aboard ship while returning from the South Pacific in World War II and was buried at sea in May of 1945.

169
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Mr.

170
00:17:44,500 --> 00:18:03,000
Downs attempted to get a grave marker for a token burial plot for his son, but was told at the time that the federal government would not provide grave markers for those who had died at sea.

171
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Frustrated, he approached William Loeb of the Manchester Union leader for help.

172
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And this was the beginning of the creation of a memorial for those from New Hampshire who were lost at sea in all wars.

173
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:38,500
In 1950, Governor Sherman Adams created the New Hampshire Marine Memorial Commission, and after seven years of study, hard work, and fundraising, the Lady of the Sea Marine Memorial was dedicated on Decoration Day 1957.

174
00:18:38,500 --> 00:19:18,000
The memorial includes the names of 248 men, not only World War II veterans, but also two service members who were killed when the USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor prior to the Spanish-American War, five veterans of World War I who died when their ships were sunk en route to France, and one sailor who was lost when the destroyer USS Reuben James was sunk by a German U-boat just prior to America's entrance into World War II.

175
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:27,500
In 1990, legislation was adopted to include Vietnam War veterans and World War II Merchant Mariners on the memorial.

176
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:37,000
On Memorial Day 1993, the memorial was rededicated, adding 42 names to the honor roll, including 24 Merchant Mariners.

177
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,500
The memorial presently has 290 names, but the design allows for over 400.

178
00:19:43,500 --> 00:20:01,500
The purpose of this bill is to seek the addition of more recent New Hampshire service members who were lost at sea while serving in Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and the Global War on Terrorism.

179
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:19,500
One such member, Hampton native Marine Corporal Jonathan Currier, was believed to have fallen overboard while deployed aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Essex while sailing off the coast of the Philippines in August of 2018.

180
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
He was declared lost at sea.

181
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
His body never recovered.

182
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Another service member, Marine Captain Gary Dillon of Concord, would also be eligible for inclusion if this bill was passed.

183
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Captain Dillon, a Marine aviator, was killed in a helicopter mid-air collision while conducting night vision goggle training in the Arabian Sea.

184
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:51,000
This happened just before the onset of hostilities and desert storm.

185
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
His body was also never recovered.

186
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:14,500
When I spoke to the Division of Parks and Recreation about how to go about adding names to the memorial, I was told the criteria is set through the legislature, and that's when I reached out to Representative Edgar for help.

187
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,500
His efforts have led to the bill that is before this committee.

188
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:29,500
The Marine Memorial doesn't exist just to memorialize those lost in World War I or World War II.

189
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:38,500
It needs to continue as a living monument to honor those lost at sea defending our country today.

190
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:46,000
Passing this bill would allow Jonathan and Gary's names to be added to the stone.

191
00:21:46,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It would allow the Lady of the Sea Memorial to provide solace to the Courier family, where Jonathan played on the beach beneath her gaze as a child.

192
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:26,000
With its location at the edge of the shore, overlooking the vast ocean that is the final resting place of so many of our heroes, an updated memorial would allow tens of thousands of people who visit Hampton Beach the opportunity to pause and reflect on the continuing cost of our freedom.

193
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I thank you for the opportunity to address you this morning, and I strongly urge you to support this bill.

194
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Thank you.

195
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Thank you, Ms.

196
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Bennett, for your service and all the good folks at Post 35.

197
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,500
Are there questions for Mr.

198
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Bennett?

199
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Yes.

200
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

201
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Chairman.

202
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:16,000
I just wondered if this had been, as far as the inscription of the names and so forth, that that's going to be done through the Division of Parks and Recreation and the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

203
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Are they on board with this?

204
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
or have they been solicited for providing the funds for doing this?

205
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yes, sir.

206
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:37,500
As the previous bill mentioned, it is the responsibility of DNCR to fund the engraving of the names of the memorial.

207
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:51,000
and I have reached out to the department, and they are aware, and they have in fact reiterated that it is their responsibility to engrave the names.

208
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Thank you, Representative.

209
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
Are there any other questions?

210
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Seeing none, thank you.

211
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Thank you.

212
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Thank you.

213
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,000
We'll now recognize Gail Wallach.

214
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Would you please come forward and welcome to Public Works.

215
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Good morning, Mr.

216
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,500
Chairman, members of the committee.

217
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:25,500
My name is Gail Wallach and I am the Deputy Director of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Division of Parks and Recreation.

218
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:33,000
I have brought copies of what I'm about to read for our testimony for you.

219
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Please accept this testimony on behalf of the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Division of Parks and Recreation regarding HB 1456 relative to the Hampton Marine Memorial.

220
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:03,000
The Division supports this bill to honor the veterans by adding the names of those lost at sea to the Marine Memorial from recent military conflicts and the September 11th, 2001 attack.

221
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
We have conducted additional research since our submission of the fiscal note.

222
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,500
The Marine Memorial has room to add up to 233 names.

223
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:31,000
As of this writing, the estimated cost to add names to the memorial is $9 per letter or an average of $180 per name at 20 characters with a $140 one-time setup fee.

224
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Using this information, approximately 50 to 55 names could be added for the cost of $10,000 as proposed in the fiscal note.

225
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
As required by law, costs would be paid from existing departmental appropriations.

226
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:08,000
There is currently approximately a two-year wait for new engraving work, but that time could be used to allow the appropriate veterans organizations to provide us with the names of veterans that need to be added to the Marine Memorial.

227
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,500
We thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on this bill and are happy to answer any questions.

228
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
Thank you, Deputy Director.

229
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Other questions?

230
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,000
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony.

231
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If we could just trouble you to pass a copy of your testimony on.

232
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Thank you.

233
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
To the clerk.

234
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
The clerk.

235
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Is there anyone here, anyone else that wishes to testify on House Bill 1456?

236
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,500
Seeing none, we will call the public hearing to a close at 10-12.

237
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Thank you, Mark.

238
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:03,000
I will now open the executive session on House Bill 1436, an act relative to the Hampton Marine Memorial.

239
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,500
You can come back to your chairs.

240
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,000
Representative Edgar moves Amendment 2022-039H.

241
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Is there a second?

242
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Second.

243
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Mr.

244
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Chairman, I will second that motion.

245
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Representative Edgar moved and Representative Cloutier seconded the approval of Amendment 2022-0039H.

246
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,500
Is there any discussion on the amendment?

247
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Seeing none, all those in favor of the adoption of the amendment signify by saying aye.

248
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Opposed nay.

249
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
The ayes have it, unless my hearing is gone, unanimously.

250
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:52,000
I would look to Representative Edgar for a motion of ought to pass as amended on House Bill 1456FN.

251
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yes, sir, I make that motion motion Chairman.

252
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Representative Edgar moves out to pass as amended on House Bill 1456.

253
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Is there a second?

254
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,500
Representative McConkie seconded the motion.

255
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Discussion on the motion of ought to pass as amended.

256
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
See none.

257
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Oh, Representative Query.

258
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Yeah, I just wanted to say I think this is a no-brainer.

259
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:41,000
I would just ask that we not put it on consent calendar so that we can take the appropriate moment to recognize the people that we've lost at sea on the day of when we hear this in session.

260
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Thank you.

261
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You're one step ahead of me.

262
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:55,500
I was going to ask about consent after we had passed the motion of ought to pass as amended.

263
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,000
However, seeing no further discussion, the clerk will call the roll.

264
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Senator McConkie.

265
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Aye.

266
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Senator Sauer.

267
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Aye.

268
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Senator Sauer.

269
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Aye.

270
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Aye.

271
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Senator Jaggi.

272
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Yes.

273
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I would ask that you remember to press the little red button so that your votes are going out live to those who are watching the testimony that is being live streamed.

274
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Just a reminder.

275
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Thank you.

276
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
We'll continue from where you were.

277
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Representative Thompson.

278
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Aye.

279
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Thank you.

280
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We'll continue from where you were.

281
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yes.

282
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Representative Abbott?

283
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yes.

284
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Representative Faulkner?

285
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yes.

286
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Representative Newman?

287
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yes.

288
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Representative Eaton?

289
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Aye.

290
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And Mr.

291
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Chairman?

292
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes.

293
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,500
The vote is 15 to—oh.

294
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
You skipped two people.

295
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
Oh.

296
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Oh.

297
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Oh.

298
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Oh.

299
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Oh.

300
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Oh.

301
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Oh.

302
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Oh.

303
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Oh.

304
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Oh.

305
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Oh.

306
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
Oh.

307
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Yes.

308
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,500
The vote is 15 to 0.

309
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
You skipped two people.

310
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,500
I'm sorry, there are people on the back.

311
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Representative Query.

312
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Aye.

313
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Yes.

314
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,500
The vote is 17 to 0.

315
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
The vote is 17 to 0.

316
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,500
The motion of ought to pass as amended is adopted.

317
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:19,000
And at the request of representative query, it will go on to the regular calendar.

318
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Again, I didn't time this right.

319
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
We have about 10 minutes until our next bill, which is House Bill 1553 relative to roadside memorials.

320
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Once again, I am a co-sponsor and the vice chair will be conducting the hearing on that bill.

321
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,500
We will reconvene at 10.30.

322
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Thank you.

323
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Thank you.

324
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Thank you.

325
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Thank you.

326
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Thank you.

327
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Thank you.

328
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Thank you.

329
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
Thank you.

330
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Thank you.

331
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Thank you.

332
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,500
We will start the hearing in two minutes.

333
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:16,500
If anyone else wishes to speak, please fill out a pink card and pass it forward to the clerk, please.

334
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Thank you.

335
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:29,000
What Bradley is handing out right now is an amendment to the bill that we will hear next, not this bill.

336
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So please just set it aside so we can concentrate on what's in front of us.

337
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And we will discuss that amendment at the appropriate time.

338
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Thank you.

339
00:32:44,000 --> 00:33:18,500
prime sponsor representative eaton please good morning mr chairman and members my name is Daniel Eaton representing Cheshire district 3 I guess everything that's old is new again this is not the first time the committee has seen this bill and the basis for the bill is that we have in the last dozen years or, seen a rapid increase of roadside memorials being dropped all over the state.

340
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:38,000
For those of you that don't know what a roadside memorial is, it is usually placed on the side of the road when there has been a fatal accident and someone wants to memorialize the loss at that location.

341
00:33:38,000 --> 00:34:07,500
in prior years, back during my tenure as a police chief on a stretch of highway that had probably more than its fair share of fatals, it wasn't abnormal to see some sort of memorial go up within a week or two after the loss of life, and it would stay for 30 or 60 days and disappear again.

342
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Now the tendency is to not just place a memorial, bearing in mind that more often than not, the location of these memorials is already an unsafe location.

343
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,000
So any activity there is, one, a distraction to ongoing drivers.

344
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,500
Two, activity by family members at that location creates an obstruction.

345
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:38,500
They are going back and putting up plastic flowers spring or fall.

346
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:46,500
The new magic trick is to put battery-operated lights, so you're distracted both day and night.

347
00:34:46,500 --> 00:35:08,000
A loss of life is a tragedy for anyone under any circumstance, but the fact is the overwhelming majority of people have a grave or an urn or somewhere to have their private moments for dealing with a memorial of an individual lost.

348
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,000
To place it on a public highway makes it a public event.

349
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:26,000
It is sometimes, sadly, more about the person left behind than the person that has been lost and is not a good public service.

350
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Add to that that the Department of Transportation is required to maintain the sides of the roads year-round.

351
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:46,500
Frequently, these set up an obstruction, making it very difficult, if not impossible, for doing their jobs properly, adequately, and more importantly, safely.

352
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:56,000
For that and many other reasons, I'd be happy to bring up, but would like to keep this timely.

353
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,500
I'll conclude and be more than happy to answer any questions.

354
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
Thank you, Representative.

355
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Are there questions for Representative Eaton?

356
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,000
Seeing none, thank you for your testimony.

357
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Appreciate getting let off the hook.

358
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,500
We try and move quick.

359
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,500
The chair will recognize David Rodri from Department of Transportation.

360
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
David, welcome back.

361
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,500
It's nice to see you again.

362
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Good morning.

363
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
Thank you, Representative.

364
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:36,000
Nice to see you and nice to see everybody from the committee today.

365
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,500
Thank you for having me.

366
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:46,500
For the record, my name is David Rodriguez, Director of Operations for the Department of Transportation.

367
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:56,500
I would like to start by reinforcing all of the points that the sponsor made as he introduced the bill.

368
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,500
The department would concur that that is an accurate analysis.

369
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,500
I want to go on to explain our current practice.

370
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,500
The department currently removes memorials that are a hazard immediately.

371
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,000
We remove memorials that interfere with maintenance or mowing when the operations occur.

372
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:32,500
And memorials that are set back away from the road or are not an immediate hazard to the motorist often stay in the right of way for some time.

373
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Removal of roadside memorials is an emotionally charged issue and it's for that reason that the department appreciates the legislature taking up this issue and letting us know what the will of the people is, and we will follow that will of the people.

374
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,500
And I'd be happy to take any questions.

375
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Thank you.

376
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,000
Are there questions for Mr.

377
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Rodriguez for the department?

378
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Seeing none.

379
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Thank you, sir.

380
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, I apologize.

381
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Representative Newman?

382
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yes.

383
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Thank you sir.

384
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I apologize.

385
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Representative Newman.

386
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Yes.

387
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,500
I have to keep holding this one.

388
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Okay.

389
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
Thank you.

390
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:52,000
My question is on the, in section two on the back side here, when the legislation talks about if not removed pursuant to the RSA, the department shall remove and dispose after 90 days, commencing from the date of the event being memorialized.

391
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
How do you keep track of when 90 days is?

392
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,500
So currently we do not keep track.

393
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:07,000
The law would require us to keep some sort of track of that.

394
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We believe the bill as written is permissive.

395
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,500
It directs us after 90 days to remove it.

396
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:29,000
So we don't read that to be on the 91st day, but we do read that to be within a reasonable amount of time after 90 days.

397
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So we would have to track that to an extent.

398
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:43,500
But because we believe the bill is permissive, we think that'll be a manageable thing for us to do.

399
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Thank you.

400
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Any further questions?

401
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Seeing none.

402
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Thank you.

403
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Thank you.

404
00:39:53,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Is there anyone else present that would wish to testify on House Bill 1553-FN?

405
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,000
Seeing none, we will close this hearing.

406
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Thank you, Representative McConkie.

407
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,500
I will now open the Executive Session on House Bill 1553, an act relative to roadside memorials.

408
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,000
What is the will of the Committee?

409
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Representative Eaton.

410
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Mr.

411
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Chairman, I would defer to Representative Cloutier, please.

412
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Thank you, Mr.

413
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Chairman, I would defer to Representative Cloutier, please.

414
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Thank you, Mr.

415
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Chairman.

416
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,500
I move ought to pass on House Bill 1553.

417
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,000
Representative Cloutier moves House Bill 1553 ought to pass.

418
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Is there a second?

419
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,500
Representative Eaton seconds the motion.

420
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,000
Discussion on the bill and the recommendation of ought to pass.

421
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Representative Thomas.

422
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Okay, so can everybody hear me?

423
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
All right.

424
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,500
I believe this is an important bill.

425
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,000
This is the third time we've had this bill.

426
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,500
I think it was Representative Eaton first introduced it, I believe, in 2018.

427
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,000
He again introduced it 2020.

428
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:26,000
The Senate, for some reason, in 2018 didn't want to go along with it.

429
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:42,500
And then in 2020, when I was chair, because it was passed by our committee in the full House, but then COVID hit and there were so many other, Senate had other priorities.

430
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:48,500
They thought this was not a priority, so they let it die.

431
00:41:48,500 --> 00:42:07,000
I think it's time that we pass this bill again and send it to the Senate and try to, you know, really persuade the Senate that this is a very important public safety issue for the DOT.

432
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And IT.

433
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:41,500
and I think it even affects our local highway departments as well and I think it's time to get it done I think it's common sense I know there are emotional issues involved but I think this is a reasonable bill that is permissive and has been written very carefully so I would urge this off you all to support the motion about to pass.

434
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Thank you.

435
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
Representative Thompson.

436
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Thank you, Mr.

437
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Chairman.

438
00:42:49,500 --> 00:43:02,500
I'd just like to go on the record as saying I think that the 90-day allowance to remove the memorial, and in light of what Mr.

439
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:11,000
Rodriguez said, the department, you know, endeavors to make it 90 days, but sometimes it takes longer.

440
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:32,000
My personal feeling from watching one of the most horrific accidents we had up in the North country this year, or two years ago, watching what happened with the memorial that was placed there on the side of the road immediately after.

441
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's not 90 days or 120 days out.

442
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:49,500
It's the first 30 days that these people tend to congregate on these memorials, and I think that I personally would like to see a 30-day removal.

443
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:56,000
I think beyond that, people can go to the grave and mourn there.

444
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,500
It may not be a popular decision, but that's my opinion.

445
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Thank you.

446
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Any further representative, Faulkner?

447
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:48,000
I would agree with that, but I also would like to add that there are, they were not restricting memorials that might be on private property, and although memorials along Route 2 there, people put their own memorials on their private property, so that wouldn't be affected if people want to do that that would continue so i think the fact i think that we've provided as much of a you know access to the public as is needed even with 30 days Representative Query.

448
00:44:48,000 --> 00:45:02,500
I have a little bit of a concern about some of the costs that might pop up over time, but I guess we'll see if that as it comes.

449
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:24,000
It won't stop me, but I do feel like there will probably be a little bit of a clerical cost just to track all this information, but then also the disposal of these memorials might start costing now that they're being collected quicker.

450
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And then potentially, while things are still in good condition within that 90-day time frame, people who left those memorials may want to try and collect what is left over from them.

451
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:54,500
So I do think that there could be some storage costs and disposal costs that might pop up, but it won't stop me from voting in favor of this.

452
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,500
Thank you.

453
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,500
Any further discussion?

454
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
Seeing none.

455
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,500
The clerk will call the roll.

456
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,500
All right.

457
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500

Aye.

Yes.

Aye.

Representative Cloutier.

484
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Aye.

Representative Tlerski.

497
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Clerk votes yes.

498
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
Representative Abbott.

499
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Yes.

500
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
Representative Faulkner.

501
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,500
Yes.

502
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Representative Newman.

503
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Representative Newman.

504
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Representative Newman.

505
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,500
Representative Newman.

506
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,500
Yes.

507
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,500
Representative Eaton.

508
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Aye.

509
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Representative Query.

510
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,500
Aye.

511
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Representative Bunker.

512
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
Thank you.

513
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Representative Query?

514
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Aye.

515
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Representative Bunker?

516
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
Yes.

517
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,500
Mr.

518
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Chairman?

519
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
Yes.

520
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:18,500
The vote being 17 to 0, the motion of ought to pass is adopted.

521
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Is there any objection to the consent calendar?

522
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,500
Seeing none, it will go on to the consent calendar.

523
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:32,000
I'll close the executive session on House Bill 1553.

524
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,500
Once again, I misjudged the time, but if I did these things in 15-minute increments, we'd be running over.

525
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,500
You just don't know.

526
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:59,500
We have 15 minutes until our next hearing, which is House Bill 1572 relative to funds credited to the harbor dredging peer maintenance and make an appropriation for dredging of the harbors.

527
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,000
I will ask everybody to be back at 11.

528
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Thank you very much.

529
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,500
I think too many people have their buttons pressed when it goes green.

530
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:21,000
So I think everyone just needs to make sure they turn off after they speak Thank you.

531
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Thank you.

532
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Thank you.

533
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Thank you.

534
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Thank you.

535
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Thank you.

536
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Thank you.

537
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Thank you.

538
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Thank you.

539
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Thank you.

540
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Thank you.

541
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Thank you.

542
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Thank you.

543
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Thank you.

544
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Thank you.

545
00:49:49,000 --> 00:50:10,000
The time being 11 a.m., I would call to order the public hearing on House Bill 1572-FN-A, an act relative to funds credited to the Harbor Dredging and Peer Maintenance Fund, and making appropriations for dredging of Rye Harbor and Seabrook-Hampton Harbor.

546
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,500
The sponsors not being here, I would recognize Representative Query to introduce the bill to the committee.

547
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
Thank you, Mr.

548
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
Chairman.

549
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:30,000
In the absence of the sponsors and co-sponsors, I'm gonna be introducing HB 1572 FNA.

550
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Thank you, and there will be no questions.

551
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,500
He's doing this as a courtesy to the committee.

552
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,000
Nobody is here to testify.

553
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
We have an amendment that was handed out.

554
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,500
The amendment is non-germane to the bill as introduced.

555
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,000
We will not be discussing that amendment.

556
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Any questions or comments about that seeing none and not knowing what the committee wants to do I will close the public hearing on House Bill 1572 FNA and I will open the executive session on House Bill 1572 FNA.

557
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Well, wait a minute.

558
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,500
Let me reopen the hearing.

559
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:27,000
Does anybody need to hear, or does the ports and harbor need to say anything about the original bill?

560
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Anybody have any questions of them?

561
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Okay.

562
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We'll roll back into executive session.

563
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I will say that I talked to Ms.

564
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Marconi about what the bill did.

565
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:52,500
He does not need anything from us to change anything, add any money, or anything else for dredging and harbor maintenance.

566
00:51:52,500 --> 00:52:01,500
And for some of us, we hear it on a regular basis in some of the statutory committees.

567
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:10,500
And so I was kind of confused when I first saw the bill anyways on what he needed.

568
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:17,500
That being said, we are in executive session on House Bill 1572 as introduced.

569
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,000
What is the pleasure of the committee?

570
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Mr.

571
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,500
Chairman, I would like to move ITL.

572
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Representative Edgar moves ITL on House Bill 1572 as introduced, seconded by Representative Abbott is there any discussion Representative Query I have a parliamentary question and we can answer it after the executive session it's just about like who can introduce amendments the committee.

573
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:55,500
The sponsors have a lot of leeway on bringing clarifying amendments to their bills.

574
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:09,500
It is something that most chairmen will ask the sponsors to do if they want to have something changed, that they do the amendment and bring it forward.

575
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:37,000
The committee doesn't have to accept any amendment brought in by anybody to include a member of the committee, but it would be up to the members of the committee for somebody to move approval of an amendment, second it, and then we would have the normal procedure, and then it becomes a committee amendment.

576
00:53:37,000 --> 00:54:06,500
But if you have a bill in front of another committee that you need to have something changed in because it didn't get printed quite right or whatever, you should, as the sponsor, make the amendment to cut down on the work of the committee because they might just say, we're not going to bother to do your work.

577
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,000
So that's kind of where that whole issue is.

578
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Thank you.

579
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,500
Seeing no further discussion, the clerk will call the roll on inexpedient to legislative House Bill 1572.

580
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,500
Okay.

581

00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,500
Is there any objection to consent calendar?

619
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:57,000
It will come off, I'm sure, but let's put it there to start.

620
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Seeing none, it will go under the consent calendar, and I hereby close the executive session on House Bill 1572.

Thank you.

735
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,500
Thank you.

736
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Thank you.

737
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Thank you.

738

Thank you.

741
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Thank you.

742
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,500
Thank you.

743
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,500
Thank you.

744
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,500
Thank you.

745
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,500
Thank you.

746
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,500
Thank you.

747
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
Thank you.

748
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Thank you.

749
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,500
Thank you.

750
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,500
Thank you.

751
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Thank you.

752
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Thank you.

753
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
Thank you.

754
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
Thank you.

755
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,500
Thank you.

756
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,500
Thank you.

757
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,500
Thank you.

758
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:20,000
Anyone who is going to be testifying on House Bill 1217, please fill out a pink card and make sure it gets to the front.

759
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Thank you.

760
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Thank you.

761
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Thank you.

762
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Thank you.

763
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Thank you.

764
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Thank you.

765
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:47,500
The time being 1.15, I would call the public hearing on House Bill 1217 relative to agency reporting of state-owned property to order and would recognize Representative Trottier, the prime sponsor.

766
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,000
Good afternoon, members and Mr.

767
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Chair.

768
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,500
I'd like to thank you for your...

769
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,000
Good afternoon, members and Mr.

770
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Chair.

771
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,500
I'd like to thank you for your time and consideration on House Bill 1217 FM.

772
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:21,500
It has been brought to my attention that the state does not have a centralized database to keep track of all state-owned property that is abandoned or vacant.

773
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
So this is abandoned or vacant.

774
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:39,500
So this bill would, it's been brought to my attention that each individual agency, it could be DOT, Department of Safety, and so on, have certain properties under their control.

775
01:02:39,500 --> 01:03:24,000
So with this bill, my goal is to require each state agency that has property under their control to report that to the administrative services who should keep a centralized database whereby the public has a knowledge and biannually what I would like to see is that the administrative services files a report on each piece of property that is either vacant or abandoned explaining if the property could be sold transferred to the community where it is located so it can be put back on the tax base.

776
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:39,500
I know in the town that I represent and where I live in the town of Belmont we currently have a state property up there that people have interested in purchasing.

777
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,000
It was under the Department of Safety.

778
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Marine Patrol was there until their new facility was built, and I'm just being told it's being used to store some equipment.

779
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
So that is my goal with this bill.

780
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:26,000
If there's some state properties that we have no intentions of using, developing, expanding, I would like to see if there's any way of unloading that from the state by sales, transfer to the communities, and get it back on the tax map to help these communities that are struggling to get more taxes brought in.

781
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Thank you.

782
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Any questions from the committee to the representative?

783
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I see none.

784
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I do have one.

785
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:51,500
Why do you think that the current RSA 439 E reporting requirements of property owned by state agencies does not fit the same bill and this would be redundant to that?

786
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Thank you.

787
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Any further questions from the committee?

788
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,500
Representative Thompson.

789
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:06,500
Don't we have, and I'll address this to you, Representative, but I'm not sure you'll know.

790
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:11,000
Doesn't surplus property have a list of those properties?

791
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Representative, we will be hearing from administrative services in just a minute.

792
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:26,500
I think that question is probably more appropriate to them or the other agencies that are here to speak.

793
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
Seeing none, thank you.

794
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:31,500
Next I'd like to call Mr.

795
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:38,000
Jared Nyland, Department of Administrative Services, who is in opposition to the bill.

796
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Thank you, Mr.

797
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Chair and, sorry, representatives.

798
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Department of Administrative Services is opposed to the proposed legislation.

799
01:05:47,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Essentially the concern of the department is the resting, the bill rests on two terms, vacant and abandoned, which are not defined in the statute and don't have a consistent meaning in the real estate industry.

800
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:17,000
We would point the committee or the sponsor to Senate Bill 359, which was introduced last week, which is a similar type of bill.

801
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:30,500
It has some issues of its own, but we think it provides a more workable framework for mandating state agencies to publicly identify surplus real property assets.

802
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:38,500
I have a brief summary written testimony here to offer if you'd like to circulate that.

803
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,500
Any questions?

804
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,500
Questions of the committee?

805
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,500
I do have one.

806
01:06:44,500 --> 01:07:01,500
And It is my understanding that there is an electronic version of the inventory of state property that is currently required to be maintained by the department that is accessible to the public electronically.

807
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,500
Is that not true?

808
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,500
There we go.

809
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,500
That is correct.

810
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:16,000
Yes, the department maintains, as far as I know, the only statewide inventory of state real property.

811
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It's in database form.

812
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,500
It is electronically accessible online.

813
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:26,500
It does not include designations of whether property is abandoned or vacant.

814
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,500
Thank you.

815
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,500
Representative Faulkner.

816
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,500
Thank you.

817
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Is there a consistent, I think you hinted that there wasn't a consistent process by which an agency would determine property surplus.

818
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:49,500
Surplus is the term we really want to look at, isn't it?

819
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:58,000
Is there a consistent process across the different agencies, or does each agency develop its own process?

820
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Thank you.

821
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:11,000
So as I understand the question, you're asking if each agency has its own process for determining whether a property is surplus.

822
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I believe that's true to the extent that there is a process.

823
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:27,500
It is in the discretion of each agency, and it's in the context of the proposed disposal of surplus real estate.

824
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:34,000
And that's usually, that's almost always the context in which it is made.

825
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:42,000
So most agencies don't review their inventory and say, okay, this one's surplus, this one's not.

826
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,500
That's not a normal occurrence.

827
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:54,000
That usually only happens when a property has been identified as one that they are looking to dispose of.

828
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Thank you.

829
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Representative Thompson.

830
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Thank you, Mr.

831
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Chairman.

832
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I guess that raises a question.

833
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Why aren't they already identified as to whether they're abandoned?

834
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I mean, it seems like that's – it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me that you only look at a particular property that you want to get rid of.

835
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Shouldn't you look at all of them and decide which ones need to be disposed of?

836
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I can think of a half a dozen right off the top of my head around the state.

837
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,500
I mean, that could be the case.

838
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:52,500
I don't believe that's currently a policy that we follow in general.

839
01:09:52,500 --> 01:10:02,000
But if the legislature decides to make that a policy that we should follow, then we could do that.

840
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Okay.

841
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Thank you.

842
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Representative Eaton.

843
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I served on a committee about 10 years ago that was charged with disposing of so-called abandoned properties.

844
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Would you believe that we found going through the process of what we thought were abandoned properties were actually properties that had use years down the road that we weren't readily seeing that moment in front of us.

845
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:51,500
And a legislative mandate may cause greater expense for the state over a course of time than doing what that committee did at the time, which was find readily disposable properties.

846
01:10:51,500 --> 01:11:07,500
And I think that the last couple questions have been trying to get an answer that is not within the purview of one department, that each department has some purview over that.

847
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:13,500
And we do have RSAs that deal with the disposal of property.

848
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:22,000
And if we want to change those, anybody can file a bill next term to do that.

849
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:33,500
But I think we're asking the representative, DAS, to make generalities about property that belonged to other agencies and how they handle that.

850
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,500
Any other questions?

851
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,500
Representative Cloutier.

852
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,500
Thank you.

853
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,500
I'm wondering, Mr.

854
01:11:41,500 --> 01:12:22,500
Nyland, and this is some questions about the bill's fiscal note, and I don't know if you can answer them, and I noticed that it was written on October 28th of last year, and then there's a methodology, and this is the second paragraph, and going down, the Department of Administrative Services states they do not currently collect the information required by the bill, nor do they have direct access to the information for state real property managed by other state agencies.

855
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:32,500
Therefore, in order to collect and maintain the property information, there would be an indeterminable increase on various state expenditures.

856
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:52,500
It goes on to state that as of the date of October 28th, they were unable to determine the additional staff hours or additional staff across different agencies that would be needed to meet the required obligations in the bill.

857
01:12:52,500 --> 01:13:10,000
By any chance, I don't know if you can answer this question, have you done any more research for this fiscal note and have an updated fiscal note or could get this committee more information?

858
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,500
Or does it stand what was written on October 28th of last year?

859
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:20,000
You mean as far as the fiscal?

860
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah, you're right.

861
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:35,000
As far as an indeterminable, if we pass this bill as written, it might be an indeterminable increase to the state budget for various state agencies.

862
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Okay.

863
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I have no further information to offer on that at this time.

864
01:13:43,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I believe that the use of the primary terms vacant and abandoned is just, it's very difficult, you know, with no definitions in the bill, it's very difficult to determine what that means or what kind of analysis that's going to involve by individual state agencies.

865
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Okay, so in other words, follow up, Mr.

866
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:17,500
Chairman, the fiscal note is written right now, has not been changed or updated, right?

867
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,000
As far as I know.

868
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Okay, all right, great.

869
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Thank you.

870
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Thank you, Mr.

871
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Chairman.

872
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Thank you.

873
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Any further questions?

874
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

875
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Thank you.

876
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Any further questions?

877
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

878
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:56,500
Next, I'd like to call Patrick Hackley, Division of Forests and Lands, who says he has written testimony but does not indicate whether he supports or opposes the bill.

879
01:14:56,500 --> 01:15:00,000
And hopefully it won't take 10 minutes.

880
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,500
and members of the committee for the record my name is Patrick Hackley.

881
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:14,500
I'm the new face of the Division of Forests and Lands, the director for that agency.

882
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,000
And we don't have a formal position.

883
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
We just have some input to provide as you consider this bill.

884
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,000
So our division is under the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources.

885
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:44,000
The Division of Forests and Lands is we're the agency in the execution of all matters pertaining to forestry of state lands within the jurisdiction of the state.

886
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Our agency manages 218 state reservations, and these are designated as either state forests, parks, natural areas, or historic sites.

887
01:15:54,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And that totals approximately 170,000 acres from Pittsburgh to Nashua and everywhere in between.

888
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,500
The bill as proposed should provide a definition of the terms.

889
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:11,000
These are just our, this is our constructive input.

890
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:44,000
And as the speaker before me mentioned, the terms vacant and abandoned imply a property with no value or particular use to the public state reservations include both developed state parks and undeveloped state forests that we actively manage or simply hold to provide a host of public benefits the following New Hampshire statute provides greater detail as follows this is under RSA chapter 227 H1.

891
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:57,000
It is hereby recognized and declared that the state-owned reservations contribute to the conservation of natural resources and a distinctive quality of life in the state.

892
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:25,500
The public welfare of the state is served by the prudent acquisition and management of reservations to provide forest benefits for the purposes of demonstrating sound forestry, protecting habitat for plants, animals, and other organisms, conserving forested watersheds, preserving areas of rare or exemplary natural beauty and ecological value, and providing for perpetual public use and access.

893
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:31,000
So these forest benefits are further defined in RSA 227 G2.

894
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:47,500
Forest benefits include but are not limited to forest products, a viable forest based economy, recreation opportunities, scenic values, healthful surroundings, climate mitigation, clean water, and biologically diverse populations of plants and animals.

895
01:17:47,500 --> 01:18:07,000
So we recommend that the bill, at the very least, define the terms vacant and abandoned to ensure that these terms are not broadly defined without considering each state agency's purpose and mission for holding and managing that property.

896
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
So that's the gist of my formal comments.

897
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I have copies here I can share with the committee.

898
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I'm happy to take any questions that you may have.

899
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Thank you.

900
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Questions from the committee?

901
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Seeing none, thank you.

902
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:37,500
And I'd like to call Steve Lebronte from New Hampshire Department of Transportation, who again neither supports nor opposes the bill.

903
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,500
Turn the mic on.

904
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,500
Thank you.

905
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,000
As you just said, my name is Steve Labonte.

906
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I am the administrator of the Bureau of Right-of-Way with the New Hampshire Department of Transportation.

907
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:03,500
A little background on the Bureau is that it's best described as the real estate agency of the department.

908
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:08,500
We survey the property that we'll need for upcoming projects.

909
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,000
We'll appraise the property that we need.

910
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:20,500
We acquire the property, manage the property, and ultimately dispose of the property when it becomes surplus.

911
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:35,000
The bill as it's written, or let me back up for a minute, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation owns 724 properties that lie outside of our active right-of-way.

912
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,500
Out of those, we've broken those properties down into three groups.

913
01:19:40,500 --> 01:20:00,000
Fifty-nine are potentially marketable to the general public in that they're large enough to either develop or they may have already been developed and someone from the general public could come in, purchase it, and put it to use.

914
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:17,500
Another 185 are marketable, but to a narrow market, meaning that it might be too small to develop, but still adds some value to an abutter, or it could be landlocked, so there's no access.

915
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,500
So they're marketable, but typically those are marketable to abutters.

916
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:36,500
480 are not marketable, meaning that they're these tiny slivers of land that are scattered, you know, left over when roads were altered and projects in the past.

917
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:52,000
So this bill would create a large burden on the department, department and I don't know that we could do this by any of the – we could meet that deadline.

918
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:01,000
And I will tell you that right now the public has no problem contacting us to buy property.

919
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I get requests to dispose of property weekly.

920
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Typically how that works is a member of the public will contact me, send in a request, they'll give us a location map, and then what we do is we start our departmental review.

921
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And that departmental review will then take a look at the property.

922
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:38,000
We have engineers from our Bureau of Highway Design as well as our Bureau of Highway Maintenance look at it.

923
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:49,500
Also, our Bureau of Environment will look at the property, and they'll determine whether this is actually surplus to the departmental operational needs.

924
01:21:49,500 --> 01:22:15,500
so we have a system in place I think this bill and I would point out the language used whether it's vacant or abandoned I would say none of the department's properties are abandoned and although a large amount might be vacant it it doesn't mean it's surplus to the department's needs.

925
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:21,500
So I'm happy to take any questions that the committee may have.

926
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:23,500
Thank you.

927
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,500
Representative Faulkner.

928
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:27,500
Thank you, Mr.

929
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:29,500
Chairman.

930
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:40,000
Looking at it from the point of view, we mentioned somebody that might be interested in acquiring one of these properties.

931
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:50,500
Could they go to their town's tax maps and identify properties that are owned by the state or by the department?

932
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:54,000
Is that typically how that gets started?

933
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Yes, they could.

934
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,500
That's quite often how they do it.

935
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,500
Further questions?

936
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,500
Seeing none, thank you.

937
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:08,000
I have no further pink cards on this bill.

938
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,500
Does anybody who has testified one time wish to speak again?

939
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:19,000
Anybody who has not testified wishing to testify, please indicate now.

940
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,500
Seeing none, I will close the hearing on House Bill 1217.

941
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:37,500
to open the executive session on House Bill 1217, FN, at this time, is there any general discussion from members of the committee on the bill?

942
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:43,000
Seeing none, what is the pleasure of the committee, Representative McConkie?

943
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Thank you, Chairman Graham.

944
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I would offer ITL on House Bill 1217FN.

945
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Second.

946
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,500
Representative McConkie has moved in a meeting to legislate, seconded by Representative Eaton.

947
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:02,000
I will say a couple of things right now.

948
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:22,500
I was one of the sponsors of what became RSA 39E when we were trying to sell property to make the state solvent at one point because there was not a database anywhere that you could go to and do that.

949
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:36,000
I have also sat for several terms on long-range planning and utilization, which is a statutory committee that deals with the sale and use of state property.

950
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:51,500
as uh miss lebronte said, there doesn't seem to be a problem with the public knowing what property is what and coming in and asking us to sell it to them.

951
01:24:51,500 --> 01:25:08,500
And if it's declared surplus by agencies, there is a process under RSA 440 for them to go through because every other agency then has an opportunity to weigh in, as do local communities.

952
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:12,000
It's not just offered up to sale.

953
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,500
I think that I agree with the ITL motion on this.

954
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:39,000
I think that if it becomes a problem of what is vacant or abandoned, then we could probably take care of that in rules under RSA 439E, which deals with the database that DAS has to maintain every two years, and it's updated.

955
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,500
So that's where I am.

956
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,500
Any further discussion?

957
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,500
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

958
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,500
Representative McConkie.

959
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,500
Aye.

960
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,500
Representative Somero.

961
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,500
Aye.

962
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,500
Representative Chlursky.

963
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:59,500
Aye.

964
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,500
Representative Chlursky.

965
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,500
Aye.

966
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Representative Cloutier.

967
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,500
Aye.

968
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,500
Representative Edgar.

969
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,500
Aye.

970
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
Representative Talurski.

971
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,500
Aye.

972
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,500
Clerk votes yes.

973
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,500
Representative Abbott.

974
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,500
Yes.

975
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Representative Faulkner.

976
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:25,500
Yes.

977
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,500
Representative Newman.

978
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
Yes.

979
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Representative Eaton.

980
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,500
Yes.

981
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,500
Representative Peterson.

982
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,500
Yes.

983
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,500
Representative Query.

984
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,500
Yes.

985
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:48,500
Representative Quon Yes Representative Peterson Yes Representative Query Yes Representative Bunker Yes And Mr.

986
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:55,000
Chairman Yes The vote is 19-0 on the motion of inexpedient to legislate.

987
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Is there any objection to the consent calendar?

988
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:03,500
Seeing none, it will go on the consent calendar.

989
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,500
Got closer this time.

990
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,500
The next area is at 1.45.

991
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:12,500
We have about five minutes before that happens.

992
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,500
Thank you.

993
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:17,000
five minutes before that happens.

994
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Thank you.

995
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Thank you.

996
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Thank you.

997
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Thank you.

998
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:34,500
Anyone who would like to testify on HB 1211, please fill out a PIN card and bring it up.

999
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,500
Thank you.

1000
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,500
Thank you.

1001
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:40,500
All right.

1002
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:56,000
The time being, 1.45, I'd like to call the hearing on House Bill 1211-FN, an act requiring the installation of electronic tolling to order and recognize the prime sponsor, Representative Horrigan.

1003
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,500
If you could make sure that's on.

1004
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,000
thank you very much Mr.

1005
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:12,500
Chair my name is Representative Timothy Horgan from Stratford County District 6 the Towns of Durham Thank you very much, Mr.

1006
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,500
Chair.

1007
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:29,500
My name is Representative Timothy Horrigan from Stratford County District 6, the towns of Durham and Madbury, which is actually also just off of exit 6 off the Spalding Turnpike.

1008
01:28:29,500 --> 01:29:18,500
And so HB 1211FN, speech process, which is well underway, which is removal of toll booths from the New Hampshire Turnpike system that's actually the more main input to it impetus for more than also establishment of all electronic tolling which you know it's taken about 35 years or more for toll booth transponders become ubiquitous enough so we know no longer need to do a cash cash toll booths you know the few people don't the transponders, we usually either take a picture of their license plate, you know, all this, or we just write it off.

1009
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:24,500
There's a certain percentage of people who get away with not paying.

1010
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:32,000
And, of course, famously right now the infamous Merrimack toll booths are being torn down.

1011
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:44,500
I mean, that's a somewhat special case because we're also eliminating the tolls, which unfortunately, elsewhere, the toll is still going to be in place.

1012
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:54,000
They're replaced with overhead gantries using E-ZPass supplemented by license plate readers like they have in most neighboring states.

1013
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I've made travel trips in New York, New York State, and I didn't go as far as Buffalo, but I could drive all the way from my home to Buffalo, and the only toll booth I'd see with over 600 miles of tolls, which is like some god-awful, with a very large amount of toll taken on my easy pass would be at Hampton, for example.

1014
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,000
And so they're relatively rapidly disappearing from our nation-state highways.

1015
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:44,500
I say relatively because, of course, as you all know, highways are built to last for many decades, even centuries, and they change rather slowly.

1016
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:52,000
So Massachusetts took all its tollbooths off the Mass Pike and their tunnels and bridges.

1017
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And the tunnels and bridges, about years ago, the last toll booth on the 506-mile New York State Thruway was torn down last summer on August 31, 2021.

1018
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I looked it up on the web and saw the press release from the governor's office about it.

1019
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:26,500
Maine is tearing down the York Toll Plaza this summer, although Maine's turnpike's other toll booths will remain in place for a while.

1020
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:40,000
So here in New Hampshire, and they haven't quite been torn down, but my understanding is that Dover and Rochester toll plazas are about to be demolished.

1021
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And I'll certainly know if the Dover one is coming down because I drive with inside of it.

1022
01:31:49,000 --> 01:32:00,500
I drive through it occasionally, and I'm with inside of it with a lot of frequency because the exit 6 is just downstream.

1023
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:05,500
It's just south of where the existing toll plaza is.

1024
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:17,500
I know it's a project to convert the Bedford toll plaza to Easy Pass, which is starting I think in a year or two.

1025
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,500
I think it's scheduled for 2022.

1026
01:32:20,500 --> 01:33:08,000
They're all in the 10-year highway plan there's nothing about the hampton or hook set tolls as of yet and unfortunately in the case of hook set they uh just about 10 years ago put in the open road tolling they did the same in hampton so that means uh you know that that means those are newer facilities so it may take a while to uh make it will take a while before you then want to upgrade them to the next level and change all electronic tolling and tear down the toll plazas.

1027
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:23,000
But the reason why – so in my opinion, the existing toll plazas, they're much more expensive to maintain and operate than the overhead gantries, and they're also very dangerous.

1028
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:37,500
I've seen – studies I've seen, so about twice as many accidents happen in the vicinity of toll plazas than in just a regular stretch of a divided highway.

1029
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:50,000
The toll plaza is a large fixed object built across the highway, and every so often someone hit it at full speed with tragic results.

1030
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:59,500
we saw a couple of people a couple of people were killed hitting the Bedford Toll Plaza in December.

1031
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:21,500
And then there's a tragic incident down in New Jersey where two brothers from the Manchester area and their sister were killed on the Atlantic City Expressway in New Jersey because they hit a Toll Plaza while on their Christmas visiting relatives for Christmas.

1032
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:27,500
Those types of accidents wouldn't happen if they weren't there to hit.

1033
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:46,500
The plazas also cause a large number of minor accidents just because drivers have to slow down reading, often confusing, signs and they're weaving from lane to lane to try to figure out what booth to drive through.

1034
01:34:46,500 --> 01:36:28,500
Of course, that's probably less of a problem now that every booth except Easy-ZPass, but expensive there now, like there'll be some cash-only booths and some E-ZPass booths, so like, you know, the drivers, you know, they start weaving around and bumping into each other and sometimes even backing up if they think they're going through the wrong booth so so the deadline is pretty far in the future although well it'll be here eventually july 1st 2035 for the removal of all remaining toll booths and that sounds like a long time but now it's 13 years and i've um only been a state rep for 14 years and um so i guess it maybe it's not that long a time but it's three years beyond the date of the current 2023 32 10 year highway plan which is embodied in HB 2022 which hopefully hopefully will go more smoothly than last time and just like we did two years ago and every two years before we'll pass it so it's three years beyond the upcoming 10 year highway plan and, and the fiscal note has an immediate, mentions $235,000 for a feasibility and location study, which would happen during fiscal year 2024.

1035
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:33,000
So I think that would be money well spent.

1036
01:36:33,000 --> 01:37:02,000
It would probably help resolve a bunch of issues other than just the narrow ones of wind and whether to tear down the toll plazas and where to put the, and of course where to put the gantries that would replace the two plazas in Hampton and the Hookset Plaza and any other plazas I may have forgotten.

1037
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So that's my bill.

1038
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It looks rather far in the future, but the future will come here eventually.

1039
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,500
And so I'd be happy to take any questions.

1040
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,500
Thank you, Representative Cludear.

1041
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,500
Sure.

1042
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:26,500
well've got the 10-year highway plan, which appears to have two Toll Plaza-related projects.

1043
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,500
It has the Bedford Merrimack project.

1044
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:49,500
I couldn't find anything about the hook set or Hampton Toll booth, but I figured that would give Gassett and this committee and all the other entities involved another couple of years to decide what to do about those locations.

1045
01:37:49,500 --> 01:38:08,000
And hopefully they would be – I mean, you could amend this highway plan if you're feeling really courageous, but probably be more realistic to put it in HB 2024, HB 2026, when the time comes along.

1046
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:20,000
But that's – and I just figured that would give everybody a few more years to look down and probably just speed it up.

1047
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:37,500
From what I understand, in addition to what's in the 10-year highway plan, of course, there's a lot of other projects that they've been thinking about, maybe even have some plans for, but given plans.

1048
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,500
So that's a.

1049
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:59,500
I just figure that gives you another budget, gives people like at least another legislative cycle to finish it and gives about like, you know, actually like about six or seven more biennia to work out all the fine details.

1050
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:05,000
And if it's not realistic, you can always extend that deadline.

1051
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:28,500
if any of us will probably I see probably some of us will still be here in 2035 when when this deadline comes but I wish I had a better answer than that but that's any further questions from members of the committee seeing none thank you.

1052
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,500
I now recognize Mr.

1053
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:32,500
John Corcoran.

1054
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:35,000
Did I say that right?

1055
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,500
From New Hampshire Department of Transportation, Turnpike.

1056
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,500
Peace.

1057
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:45,500
Good afternoon, Chairman Graham and the rest of the committee.

1058
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:56,500
We are here, the DOT is, my name is John Corcoran, I'm sorry, I'm from the Bureau of Turnpike, I'm an administrator.

1059
01:39:56,500 --> 01:40:01,000
And the DOT has no position on this bill.

1060
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:10,500
First, I'd like to explain to you, as Representative Horgan explained to you also, the status of our AET.

1061
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:18,500
Right now we are going AET which is all electronic tolling at night from 10 p.m.

1062
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:20,500
to 6 p.m.

1063
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,500
in all our plazas.

1064
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:32,500
Dover Rochester plaza will be AET in fall of this year and then the Bedford plaza will be in 2024.

1065
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:38,000
So everybody knows AET is a cashless tolling, no toll attendance.

1066
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:55,500
We also have a lot of acronyms in tolling and we have ORT which is open road tolling which is high speed tolling in the middle of the plaza and the cash to the right.

1067
01:40:55,500 --> 01:41:02,500
And then we have our traditional plaza which is cash and easy pass option.

1068
01:41:02,500 --> 01:42:00,000
The department has outlined several several steps in implementation of the AT for 2035 in our fiscal note some of the major steps is beginning is having a feasibility study taming the civil design consultant the design effort for the civil work and then the construction for all this and right now it's estimated 63 63 million this will cost us the cost is of this effort is not in our existing term by capital program and typically these get addressed through the 10-year plan other costs are not including this fiscal note that can have impact in implementation of this aet in our financial model our future implementation of a new back office system.

1069
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,500
That's the easy pass back office to handle all the accounts.

1070
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:17,000
There will also be an increase in the back office costs with AET with image review, address lookup, invoices, and sending out violations.

1071
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:27,500
There will also be a potential leakage in all this that we don't get everybody who goes through the toll plaza.

1072
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:40,500
In addition to that, there's also another contract going out for the maintenance of our lane systems out there, which will be another cost to this.

1073
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:48,000
Another thing is we have not included bonding or anything in this for the construction.

1074
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And the DOT's recommendation for this is to begin with the AET feasibility study in fall of 2024.

1075
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:10,000
This will allow us to utilize the data from Dover and Rochester implementation and to refine our AET assumptions that were used in those feasibility studies.

1076
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:20,500
And once the study is done, we have the feasibility done, the location, we can come back to legislation for approval.

1077
01:43:20,500 --> 01:43:29,500
And then at that point we can lay out a proposed schedule for AET through the 10-year process.

1078
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:31,500
That's all.

1079
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,500
Thank you.

1080
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:35,500
Questions?

1081
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:37,500
Representative Thompson.

1082
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,500
Thank you.

1083
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:41,500
Questions?

1084
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:43,500
Representative Thompson.

1085
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:45,500
Thank you, Mr.

1086
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,500
Chairman.

1087
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:59,500
Do you have any statistics on how many people actually pay the cash side of the tolls and how many people are easy pass?

1088
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:13,500
Pres right now is around 30% of cast customers okay all right thank you very much further questions from members of the committee representative clude here Thank you.

1089
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:20,000
Yes, we did lay it out that go into our whole financial model.

1090
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:28,500
With the back office costs and other vendor contracts that are coming up that we don't have.

1091
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:31,500
But planning it now, we can.

1092
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:42,500
I mean, our goal was to do a feasibility study in the future once we get better data from Rochester and Dover.

1093
01:44:42,500 --> 01:45:05,500
Because right now, how Rochester and Dover feasibility study in Bedford was done, it was a lot of different assumptions from other states and stuff but people act differently in every other state so that'll give us a good handle on representative Jack thank you mr.

1094
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:26,500
chairman thank you for coming if we were to do this project on the time frame that suggested in the bill it looks to me as though we would be tearing down perfectly serviceable toll booths to put up all electronic tolling.

1095
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:28,500
Is that correct?

1096
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,500
Yes.

1097
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,500
Any further questions?

1098
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:42,000
If we were to look at this of the 10-year plan, which we'll hear in a couple of weeks.

1099
01:45:42,000 --> 01:46:02,000
What would be the department's reaction to that so that we could continue our efforts to look at all electronic towing but not have a standalone bill that sets outside of the 10-year process, which is renewed every two years.

1100
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:09,500
That is the way the department would like to go, is through the 10-year process.

1101
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:25,000
First do the feasibility study, so then we know where the toll plazas will be located, or the gantries, and we can lay the whole project out through the 10-year process.

1102
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Is, and I know we don't have the 10-year plan in front of us at the current time, and you may not have the answer, but is there any type of feasibility study for going to AET included in any of the funding in the proposal which we, which we will get sometime this week from the governor.

1103
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,000
No, that is not in the 10-year plan right now.

1104
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Any further questions?

1105
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Thank you.

1106
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Appreciate the input.

1107
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
With that, I will close the public hearing on House Bill 1211.

1108
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Mr.

1109
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Chairman, this is a technical question.

1110
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
I'm curious.

1111
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
We haven't done this for any bills today.

1112
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,500
We could, if somebody could get the blue sheet.

1113
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:39,500
The other bigger question, which I have not got a good answer to, is those who have signed up online to support and all they do.

1114
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:48,000
That will get into the file, but I don't have it in front of me right now.

1115
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,500
It's the same problem we had a year ago.

1116
01:47:52,500 --> 01:48:00,000
If you have a pink card in, you don't have to sign the blue sheet.

1117
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,500
Was there anybody on 12-11?

1118
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:06,500
Yeah, thank you Representative Plik, if I could.

1119
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:10,000
House Bill 1211, there was Allen C.

1120
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,500
from Loudoun, representing self-representation and is against the bill.

1121
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,500
Okay.

1122
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,000
We have a few minutes.

1123
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I would like to open the executive session on House Bill 1211-FN.

1124
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:31,500
Any discussion, general discussion from the members of the committee on the bill?

1125
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,500
Representative Jack.

1126
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,500
Thank you, Mr.

1127
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,500
Chairman.

1128
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:45,000
My opinion on this bill is pretty much summarized by the question that I asked.

1129
01:48:45,000 --> 01:49:03,500
I see no benefit in tearing down perfectly serviceable tollbooths simply because an arbitrary deadline is approaching and so I'm going to be opposed to the bill is that a motion is Is there any other discussion?

1130
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:05,500
Representative Cloutier.

1131
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,500
Mr.

1132
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:20,500
Chairman, I've listened to the debate, and I'm going to make the motion of ITL, but I'm going to make a friendly right of friendly burbs.

1133
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:44,500
Originally, I thought this was a good idea, but I think we can incorporate a lot of what Representative Ford, who I commend for bringing to our attention, into the bill, into the 10-year plan, which I think is more proper venue, the more testimony that I see.

1134
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:47,500
So I'm going to move ITL.

1135
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,500
Representative Clutier moves ITL.

1136
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:51,500
Is there a second?

1137
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,500
I'll second that.

1138
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,500
Representative, who?

1139
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
Oh, Thompson.

1140
01:49:57,500 --> 01:49:59,500
Seconds, yeah.

1141
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:02,500
Seconds the bill, there were several.

1142
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:09,500
The motion before us will be any expedient to legislate on House Bill 1211.

1143
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:13,000
Is there any discussion on the motion?

1144
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Representative Cloutier.

1145
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Thank you.

1146
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Further discussion?

1147
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I concur with the former chair.

1148
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Representative Query.

1149
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,500
Yeah, can I just make a friendly reminder to turn on our mics?

1150
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:38,500
Once again, Sue and I are next to the thing and online can't hear as well.

1151
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:40,500
Thank you.

1152
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:42,500
Well, well spoken.

1153
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:53,500
I sometimes don't notice and if they're sitting right away from me, I don't have a problem even without my hearing aids.

1154
01:50:53,500 --> 01:51:00,500
I may be the youngest member here, but I am going deaf very quick.

1155
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:02,500
Okay.

1156
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,500
Any further discussion?

1157
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,500
Seeing none, and the clerk will the roll.

1158
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
Representative McConkie.

1159
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:12,500
Aye.

1160

Aye.

1162

Yes.

1164
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,500
Representative Blasek.

1165
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:24,500
Yes.

1166
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,500
Representative Gagne.

1167
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,500
Yes.

1168
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,500
Representative Thompson.

1169
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,500
Yes.

1170
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:34,500
Representative Boyd.

1171
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:36,500
Boyd votes aye.

1172
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:38,500
Representative Cloutier.

1173
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,500
Representative Cloutier votes aye.

1174
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:42,500
Representative Edgar.

1175
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,500
Aye.

1176
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,500
Representative Tulurski.

1177
01:51:46,500 --> 01:51:48,500
Yes.

1178
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:50,500
Clerk votes yes.

1179
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,500
Representative Abbott.

1180
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:54,500
Thank you.

1181
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:56,500
Representative Tlurski.

1182
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:58,500
Yes.

1183
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:00,500
Clerk votes yes.

1184
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,500
Representative Abbott.

1185
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,500
Yes.

1186
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,500
Representative Faulkner.

1187
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:08,500
Yes.

1188
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,500
Representative Newman.

1189
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,500
Yes.

1190
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:14,500
Representative Eaton.

1191
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:16,500
Aye.

1192
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,500
Representative Peterson.

1193
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,500
Yes.

1194
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:22,500
Representative Query.

1195
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,500
Yes.

1196
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:26,500
Representative Bunker?

1197
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,500
Yes.

1198
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,500
Mr.

1199
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:32,500
Chairman?

1200
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,500
Yes.

1201
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:42,500
The vote was 19-0 on the motion of an expedient to legislate on House Bill 1211.

1202
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:46,500
Is there any objection to the consent calendar?

1203
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:51,000
Seeing none, it will go on the consent calendar.

1204
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:58,500
We have about seven minutes until our next hearing at 2.15 on House Bill 1449.

1205
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:11,500
If you are going to be testifying on 1449, please fill out a pink card and make sure it makes it up here to the head.

1206
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,500
Thank you.

1207
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:15,500
Thank you.

1208
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:17,500
Thank you.

1209
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,500
Thank you.

1210
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:28,500
Just as a reminder to everybody who is going to be testifying, I do need a pink card.

1211
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:36,500
And if you submit a pink card, you do not need to sign the blue sheet.

1212
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:39,500
It is one or the other.

1213
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,500
Thank you.

1214
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:43,500
Thank you.

1215
01:53:43,500 --> 01:54:05,000
The time being 2.15, I will call the public hearing on House Bill 1449FN, enact creating a toll booth exemption for vehicle funeral processions to the Veterans Cemetery in Boscowin, and recognize the prime sponsor, Representative Maureen Mooney, to speak about her bill.

1216
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Maureen Mooney, State Representative, State Representative, County District number 21.

1217
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,500
I've provided written testimony for everybody on the committee.

1218
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:17,000
So hopefully that's been distributed.

1219
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I'm the prime sponsor and a supporter of House Bill 1449 an act creating a toll booth exemption for funeral for vehicle funeral processions to the Veterans Cemetery in Bosco in this bill adds an exemption from tolls on the turnpike system for funeral processions to the New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery in Boscoen.

1220
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
The bill is only applicable to funeral homes located in New Hampshire.

1221
01:54:50,000 --> 01:55:04,500
The bill was requested by an active member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars as a final and complimentary tribute for those who proudly serve their country I'm sorry.

1222
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:20,000
The bill was requested by an active member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars as a final and complimentary tribute for those who proudly serve their country about to be interred.

1223
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:26,000
As a side note, that individual was planning to be here today.

1224
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,500
Unfortunately, he contacted me about 6.30 a.m.

1225
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:37,500
this morning to let me know unexpectedly he could not be here, and he regrets that.

1226
01:55:37,500 --> 01:56:16,500
But his story is such, when he explained it to me to introduce this bill, is that his father was interred at the Veterans Cemetery in Boston, and his family and his friends had to pay a toll headed from Merrimack to that cemetery, weighed on him to the extent that he contacted me to sponsor this bill so that other families don't have that inconvenience while making their way to late arrest a loved one in Boscoen.

1227
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:40,000
The bill outlines the process for the toll exemption funeral procession including provisions to notify the Department of Transportation at least 24 hours in advance, having the first vehicle in the procession provided by the funeral director, and all cars in the procession traveling with headlights on.

1228
01:56:40,000 --> 01:57:00,500
We respectfully ask that you pass this bill as a proper tribute and recognition of respect for those who served in the United States Armed Forces, as well as their spouses, as they make their final journeys to their resting places.

1229
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:10,500
Thank you all for your attention to this matter, to my testimony and the testimony that will come after me.

1230
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:18,500
And as always, thank you for your service to our state and serving as state representatives.

1231
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:20,500
Thank you Mr.

1232
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:23,000
Chairman that concludes my testimony.

1233
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Thank you.

1234
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Questions from members of the committee.

1235
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
Representative Peter.

1236
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,500
Hello I'd like to ask a question about implementation.

1237
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:47,500
As time goes on and we have all electronic tolling and no toll collectors, who's going to be looking for the cars with the headlights on?

1238
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:50,000
This is a good question.

1239
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:01,000
And the DOT, I would imagine, would have a better grasp on those plans and when they'll be implemented and so forth.

1240
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:18,500
But as for this bill being effective as quickly as it will, it will be implemented pretty quickly into the toll booths that can maintain and watch out for those processions that have headlights on.

1241
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,500
Thank you.

1242
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:22,500
Further questions?

1243
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,500
Representative Faulkner.

1244
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:26,500
Thank you.

1245
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:28,500
Further questions?

1246
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,500
Representative Faulkner.

1247
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,500
Thank you.

1248
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:37,000
This identifies a benefit for New Hampshire funeral homes.

1249
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Is it true that the only people buried in the cemetery are residents of New Hampshire or do we take out of state veterans as well?

1250
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Thank you.

1251
01:58:52,000 --> 01:59:01,000
in the cemetery are residents of New Hampshire, or do we take out of state veterans as well?

1252
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:15,500
I'm going to say that I imagine that that cemetery houses those from all states who may have purchased a plot there or have arranged for a plot there.

1253
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:27,500
However, my familiarity with the logistics of that particular cemetery and who's buried where and so on, I'm not the expert in that area.

1254
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:31,000
Representative Faulkner, I do know the answer.

1255
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:40,500
Because we do use federal money from the VA to do that, any eligible veteran can be buried there.

1256
01:59:40,500 --> 01:59:48,500
The vast majority are from New Hampshire, but I do know of others from surrounding areas.

1257
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:57,000
For example, coming from Lowell, it's quicker to get to Bosco than to board on the Cape.

1258
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Representative Newman.

1259
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Thank you, Mr.

1260
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Chairman.

1261
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Thank you, Representative.

1262
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I just want to make sure I heard you said the spouses also of a deceased veteran would qualify under this legislation?

1263
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Yes, the legislation mentions the word funeral procession to Boscoen, not being specific as to whether or not the individual who's being buried there is a veteran or a loved one of a veteran.

1264
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,500
It's just a person being interred at that cemetery.

1265
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,500
Procession, period.

1266
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:43,000
And if I could I follow up?

1267
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Follow up.

1268
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Thank you.

1269
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:54,500
What is currently being done that you're aware of right now when the processions go?

1270
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:57,000
They would pay a toll.

1271
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Thank you.

1272
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Any further questions?

1273
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

1274
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:14,000
And I would recognize Peter Morin in support of the bill, and he is representing New Hampshire Funeral Directors Association.

1275
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,500
Thank you, Chairman Graham and members of the committee.

1276
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:21,500
Everywhere, I want to acknowledge everybody.

1277
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:24,000
My name is Peter Morin.

1278
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:29,000
I am a licensed New Hampshire Funeral Director in Balmer.

1279
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,000
I'm also the Executive Director of the New Hampshire Funeral Directors Association.

1280
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I've been in that position for 14 years.

1281
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I've been in funeral service for well over 20 years here in New Hampshire.

1282
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:52,500
I'm here today on behalf of the association to support House Bill 1449.

1283
02:01:52,500 --> 02:02:01,500
And we think this is an honorable gesture to our, an acknowledgement of our veterans and their families.

1284
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:10,500
And the only consideration we had was I'd like to draw your attention to page 1, line 12.

1285
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:18,000
It says, see all vehicles in the funeral procession shall travel with their headlights on.

1286
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:34,500
What we would propose is that as the committee considers and reviews this, is that there is an existing statute already which specifically deals with funeral processions, that is RSA 265 colon 156.

1287
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:44,500
I have copies of that here for the committee which along with my testimony so if you had a reference.

1288
02:02:44,500 --> 02:03:01,000
Our thinking was that in order just to pull language, whichever is easiest, whether you would reference that existing statute as far as that or whether you would actually put the language in.

1289
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:11,000
And there's just in the existing statute, it would be 265 colon 156, Roman numeral 2, be the second sentence.

1290
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:24,500
Each vehicle of a funeral procession shall be appropriately marked by having funeral flags or windshield signage and headlights, taillights, and if so equipped, hazard flashers on.

1291
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:36,000
And then a funeral escort or lead vehicle, or funeral lead vehicle, shall use and be equipped with purple flashing or emergency lights.

1292
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:42,500
So there is a statute that's on the, you know, in the books.

1293
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,500
It's always been there since 2002.

1294
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:49,500
So just to avoid any future possible confusion.

1295
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:58,000
And I do have copies, as I said, both of the statute and of my own testimony.

1296
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:02,000
And with that, I'd like to thank you.

1297
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:12,500
And in closing, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions or try to answer any questions you might have.

1298
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:14,500
Thank you.

1299
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,500
Questions from the committee?

1300
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:18,500
Representative Cloutier.

1301
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:20,500
Yes.

1302
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:43,000
My understanding is like any group of vehicles, I belong to a motorcycle group, and that is we're all responsible for our own tolls, and that there's obviously a photograph taken, and that if you didn't have an easy pass that you would be correct.

1303
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Or if they went through the E-ZPass lane and they photographed me, now you're able to pay that online within, I think, seven days.

1304
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:12,000
If you don't have an E-ZPass, you'll get an invoice, I mean, now they have the – you're able to pay that online within, I think, seven days if you don't have an E-ZPass.

1305
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:20,500
You're able to – you'll get an invoice, I believe, from the authority as I understand it.

1306
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:31,000
So there is a system in place, so you don't actually have to give them that dollar or whatever it is.

1307
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Yeah.

1308
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
You're very welcome.

1309
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Thank you.

1310
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Representative Peters.

1311
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Hello.

1312
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
I have one more implementation question.

1313
02:05:44,000 --> 02:06:01,000
If one of the members in the procession has an E-ZPass already in their car, how are they going to know not to charge his E-ZPass and to give them a free ride through?

1314
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,500
That's a very good question.

1315
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:15,000
I know when I initially got, and my transponders are sort of vintage now, but they gave me these little envelopes of sleeves.

1316
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:35,000
So like with my motorcycle in that case, I could put, if I was going to be paying it a toll, whatever, you can cover it so it does not, the transponder does not, isn't read by the toll booth.

1317
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
But I only recently came across those again.

1318
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I've never used them.

1319
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,500
So I think there is an opportunity for that.

1320
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:49,000
But, yeah, duplication could be an issue.

1321
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Any further questions?

1322
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Seeing none.

1323
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Thank you.

1324
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:01,000
And I would recognize John Corcoran, New Hampshire, Department of Transportation, Turnpikes.

1325
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Thank you, Mr.

1326
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,500
Chairman and the rest of the committee.

1327
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:09,000
My name is John Corcoran.

1328
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,500
I'm the Bureau of Turnpike Administrator for the DOT.

1329
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:19,500
I hope to answer some of the questions that people are asking.

1330
02:07:19,500 --> 02:08:23,500
First, I'll explain how a funeral procession goes through the toll plaza now typically the lead car from the funeral home will come up to the toll booth they will tell us how many vehicles they have we tell them what the cost is and then the funeral home pays it and then we put the system into we call it convoy mode so any vehicles driving through there don't get charged with their transponder or they don't get an invoice in the mail then if that's typically how happens I will tell you there are some funeral processions that just drive right through where they'll go through the high-speed tolling lanes and they'll end end up getting charged with their E-ZPass or an invoice in the mail.

1331
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:27,500
The DOT has no position on the bill.

1332
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:32,000
We do appreciate the bill and honor the veterans.

1333
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,500
We do understand there is some loss of revenue.

1334
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:45,000
That was indeterminable because we're not sure how many funeral processions go up to the Veterans Cemetery.

1335
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:52,500
But we do, there are some concerns in which was brought up in other testimonies.

1336
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:58,500
As we mentioned in the previous bill, we have AET at night.

1337
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:20,000
I don't think a lot of these will be going at night, but we are moving towards AET in Dover and Rochester, and there would be, it'd be very hard to coordinate all that, the free toll and that for those funeral processions.

1338
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:31,000
There would be work on the funeral home and also the individuals who have E-ZPass and stuff, because they will be charged.

1339
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:40,000
And that would be working with our back office vendor to try to get refunded for the toll.

1340
02:09:40,000 --> 02:10:03,500
Overall, the bill will create an increase in cost at the administrative time like I was mentioned with the in the easy pass or AET facilities it'll be on us it'll be on the funeral homes too trying to coordinate it in our back office vendor that's.

1341
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:05,500
Thank you.

1342
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:09,000
Questions from the committee to the department?

1343
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Representative Newman.

1344
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Thank you, Mr.

1345
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Cochran.

1346
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:24,000
When you mentioned convoy mode, currently if military vehicles go through, is that what they go through as?

1347
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,500
If we could keep the questions to the bill before us.

1348
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:31,500
Okay.

1349
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:33,500
Yes.

1350
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:35,500
Yes.

1351
02:10:35,500 --> 02:10:37,500
Representative Faulkner.

1352
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:56,500
I think this may be a related question, but do you have any provisions for accepting a voucher or other scrip instead of cash or EC pass if, for example, a funeral home wanted to pay that way?

1353
02:10:56,500 --> 02:11:03,000
No, we don't have any provisions for something, vouchers or anything like that.

1354
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Further questions of the department on this bill?

1355
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Representative McConkie.

1356
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Thank you, Mr.

1357
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Chairman.

1358
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:23,000
And I believe you've already answered this, but I just want to go back to it, if I could, please.

1359
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:37,000
So presently, a procession is going through the toll booth and the funeral director first car would come through and say I have 10 or I have 15.

1360
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:41,500
And then they would be charged for those 15.

1361
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:44,500
Is that what you had said?

1362
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:46,500
Yes.

1363
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:48,500
Okay.

1364
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:50,500
Thank you so much.

1365
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:52,500
Representative Thompson.

1366
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:54,500
Good afternoon, Mr.

1367
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:56,500
Cogren.

1368
02:11:56,500 --> 02:12:06,000
Do you have any statistics on how many of those convoy more would you go through in a year?

1369
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:16,500
Hooksup Plaza probably has the most funeral processions to go through, and it's around three per month overall in a year.

1370
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:20,500
Some months it's higher, some months it's lower.

1371
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:31,000
The other plazas, talking to them, they say they usually do it maybe once or twice, if lucky, in a month.

1372
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,500
So there's not a lot.

1373
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:37,000
So we're talking maybe 100 a year.

1374
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

1375
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Okay.

1376
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Thank you very much.

1377
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Well, any further questions?

1378
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:54,500
Seeing none, I think my basic question gets back to what one of the prior members was asking about.

1379
02:12:54,500 --> 02:13:11,000
how do we and how does the department handle this whole process as we go towards either more open road tolling or all electronic tolling and identifying the vehicles that are going through.

1380
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:21,000
even if we were to pass this bill, how do we prevent the double charging or charging individuals or whatever?

1381
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Has the department given any thought at all to how we handle those types of situations?

1382
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:41,000
We thought about it, but it's just too hard to handle it because of people's easy pass and knowing everybody who's in the procession.

1383
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:55,000
It could be the funeral home would have to take care of a lot of it for us to work in, but it would be a big effort.

1384
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Representative Query.

1385
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Thank you.

1386
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:12,000
I guess going off of that question, when the, say someone goes through a toll without an easy pass, how much of the vehicle is shown?

1387
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,500
Is it just the license plate area?

1388
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:18,500
Do you see the whole thing?

1389
02:14:18,500 --> 02:14:33,000
So like if someone was reviewing these images, would they be able to tell that this was part of a procession or is there just no way to tell?

1390
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,500
No, we only take pictures of the license plates.

1391
02:14:37,500 --> 02:14:39,500
That's per law.

1392
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:46,500
So we wouldn't be able to tell the vehicles in a procession or anything.

1393
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,500
Thank you.

1394
02:14:48,500 --> 02:14:50,500
Any further discussion?

1395
02:14:50,500 --> 02:14:52,500
Questions of the department?

1396
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:54,500
Excuse me.

1397
02:14:54,500 --> 02:14:56,500
Seeing none, thank you.

1398
02:14:56,500 --> 02:14:59,500
I have no further pink cards.

1399
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:06,000
Is anybody who has not testified wishing to testify on House Bill 1449?

1400
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Is anybody who has testified once willing or wanting to testify a second time?

1401
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:18,500
Seeing none, I close the public hearing on House Bill 1449.

1402
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:24,000
And I will open the executive session on House Bill 1449FN.

1403
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Some general discussion.

1404
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
First, Representative Faulkner.

1405
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Thank you.

1406
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,500
I see one problem here.

1407
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:47,500
I'm not surprised that it's made true to this drafting, is that I don't think that we're allowed to change, to treat out-of-state funeral homes differently from in-state funeral homes.

1408
02:15:47,500 --> 02:15:52,000
It's a well-established principle that you can't do that.

1409
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:59,000
If you offer it to the public, you can't discriminate across the state boundary.

1410
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
So I think that's a constitutional flaw here.

1411
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Thank you.

1412
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Anyone else?

1413
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Representative Cleary.

1414
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Thank you.

1415
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:40,500
Yeah, I just think this was something that I had when I was reading the bill originally, but it seems I do think if we do go through with this, I would like to see it amended to mirror what's in RSA 265, just because I think headlights alone are not enough of an indicator to be a procession.

1416
02:16:40,500 --> 02:16:42,500
Okay.

1417
02:16:42,500 --> 02:17:07,500
I tend to agree with that, but it gets even more complicated when the answer that you heard about the law and where they only take pictures of the license plate who is in the procession then becomes a true problem for whoever is sorting this out to sort out.

1418
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:09,500
Any further discussion?

1419
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:11,500
Representative Peterson.

1420
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:24,000
As time goes on and there are no more attendants at the tollboots, I think implementation of this is going to be confusing at best.

1421
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,500
We'll never know which cars are which.

1422
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:35,000
So we want to give everybody a free pass, but how do you do it?

1423
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
That's my concern.

1424
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Thank you.

1425
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Representative Thompson.

1426
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Thank you, Mr.

1427
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Chairman.

1428
02:17:45,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Given that there are possibly 100 of these processions a year that I would guess run anywhere from 10 to 20 cars, and the difficulty in acting this, I just don't see the need for the bill at this point Is that a motion?

1429
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:14,500
Representative Thompson moves inexpedient to legislate on House Bill 1449 FN Is there a second?

1430
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:19,000
Representative Samara seconds the motion of inexpedience to legislate.

1431
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Any further discussion?

1432
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

1433
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Representative McConkie.

1434
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Aye.

1435
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Representative Summerhill.

1436
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Aye.

1437
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Representative Fidolfi.

1438
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Aye.

1439
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Representative Blasek.

1440
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
No.

1441
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Representative Blasek.

1442
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
No.

1443
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Representative Blasek votes no.

1444
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Representative Gagne.

1445
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Aye.

1446
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Representative Thompson.

1447
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Aye.

1448
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Representative Boyd.

1449
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Not here.

1450
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Not here.

1451
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Okay.

1452
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Representative Cullen.

1453
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Aye.

1454
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,500
Representative Boyd is not here.

1455
02:19:09,500 --> 02:19:11,500
Okay.

1456
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:13,500
Representative Clotter.

1457
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:15,500
Aye.

1458
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:17,500
Representative Edgar.

1459
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:19,500
Aye.

1460
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:21,500
Representative Talurski.

1461
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:23,500
Yes.

1462
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:25,500
Clerk votes yes.

1463
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:27,500
Representative Abbott.

1464
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:29,500
Yes.

1465
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:31,500
Representative Flockner.

1466
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,500
Yes.

1467
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:35,500
Representative Newman?

1468
02:19:35,500 --> 02:19:37,500
Yes.

1469
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:39,500
Representative Eaton?

1470
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:41,500
Aye.

1471
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:43,500
Representative Peterson?

1472
02:19:43,500 --> 02:19:45,500
Yes.

1473
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:47,500
Representative Query?

1474
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:49,500
Yes.

1475
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:51,500
Representative Bunker?

1476
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:53,500
Yes.

1477
02:19:53,500 --> 02:19:55,500
Representative Bunker?

1478
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:57,500
Yes.

1479
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:59,500
Representative Bunker?

1480
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:01,500
Yes.

1481
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:03,500
Representative Bunker?

1482
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,500
Yes.

1483
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:07,500
Representative Bunker?

1484
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:09,500
Yes.

1485
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:11,500
Representative Bunker?

1486
02:20:11,500 --> 02:20:13,500
Yes.

1487
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:15,500
Representative Bunker?

1488
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:17,500
Yes.

1489
02:20:17,500 --> 02:20:19,500
Representative Bunker?

1490
02:20:19,500 --> 02:20:21,500
Yes.

1491
02:20:21,500 --> 02:20:39,000
Despite being a member of the VFW Eric Leach and all the rest I will vote yes with the vote being 17 to 1 the motion of inexpedient to legislate is adopted it Thank you.

1492
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:46,500
With the vote being 17 to 1, the motion of inexpedient to legislate is adopted.

1493
02:20:46,500 --> 02:20:50,500
Is there any objection to the consent calendar?

1494
02:20:50,500 --> 02:20:56,000
Seeing none, it will go on the consent calendar to start.

1495
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Thank you all.

1496
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And we have about five minutes until our next hearing.

1497
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Thank you.

1498
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Thank you.

1499
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Thank you.

1500
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Thank you.

1501
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Thank you.

1502
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:21,000
If you are planning on testifying on House Bill 1593, I do need a pink card.

1503
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
We will be starting in about two minutes.

1504
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,500
House bill 1593, I do need a pink card.

1505
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:33,500
We will be starting in about two minutes.

1506
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:44,500
And while we are waiting, those who made the primary motion on any of the bills do owe me a committee report.

1507
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:56,000
I can wait until tomorrow morning because the calendar is closed and it won't go in the calendar for a few weeks anyways.

1508
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:01,500
But lest I forget about getting them, please turn them in.

1509
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:03,500
Thank you.

1510
02:22:03,500 --> 02:22:05,500
Thank you, Mr.

1511
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:07,500
Chairman.

1512
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:11,000
For the record, I'm Representative Peter Somsich.

1513
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I represent Ward 3 in Portsmouth.

1514
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:21,500
And I appreciate the chairman and the committee members for letting me introduce this bill.

1515
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:39,000
Just as an aside, I want to say that during the past two years, I watched the chairman as he was very inspired and very passionate about supporting sound barriers for a neighborhood in Bedford.

1516
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:47,500
So I decided to lead by your example and be as passionate to submit this bill today.

1517
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:56,000
So Chairman Graham and committee members, and I've handed out my comments to you already, written comments.

1518
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:23,000
As you can see, I am before you today again advocating for sound barriers for the residents of Panaway Manor and the Rockingham Avenue neighborhoods in Portsmouth, who have been waiting for more than 30 years for the promise that they were given after confirmation that they qualified that such barriers would be installed.

1519
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:29,500
These neighborhoods are currently directly abutting Interstate I-95 and Route 1 bypass roadways.

1520
02:23:29,500 --> 02:23:44,000
In addition, one of Portsmouth's middle schools, attended by one-third of all middle schoolers in Portsmouth, the New Franklin School, is sandwiched between both I-95 and Route 1 Bypass.

1521
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:52,000
But these neighborhoods were already there before the expansion of I-95 and Route 1 Bypass occurred.

1522
02:23:52,000 --> 02:24:07,500
Those roadways, however, kept on expanding, also generating more and more toll revenues for the state, and are very close neighbors now to the people living and learning in that area.

1523
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:12,500
Allow me to tell you a bit about those neighborhoods.

1524
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:24,500
The residents of the Panaway Manor in Portsmouth have been waiting since the 1980s for noise abatement measures related to I-95 to be undertaken.

1525
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:38,500
As you may know, this neighborhood was built in 1942 to house defense workers for the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard as part of our nation's World War II effort.

1526
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:50,500
The New Franklin School and Rockingham Avenue neighborhoods consist of numerous single-family homes as well as being the home of the New Franklin School.

1527
02:24:50,500 --> 02:25:12,500
The students who attend that school suffer from the impacts of the traffic noise, both because classroom windows cannot be open when classes are in session, and also the traffic provides a very high level of noise when children are outside on the playground.

1528
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:30,000
I submitted this bill before the DOT developed its 10-year transportation plan, and I believe most of our needs are actually being included in that transportation plan, which your committee will be hearing next week.

1529
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:40,000
The bill before you does not include, however, a funding plan or a source of new revenue for this purpose.

1530
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:50,500
However, next week I'll be introducing another bill, HB 1656, which will suggest an additional revenue source for the highway fund.

1531
02:25:50,500 --> 02:26:20,500
While we are greatly appreciative of the support of the DOT in addressing the majority of our issues in the 10-year transportation plan, we were surprised to learn that the New Frankston School does not qualify for sound barriers because the requirements are based on the road frontage of an impacted area and not what a building is used for.

1532
02:26:20,500 --> 02:26:49,000
We respectfully hope that the DOT will reconsider this application used for schools, since a single-family home with four residents, some of whom will not be home most of the day, is certainly not the same as a school with hundreds of students who are there for a long day and also who use the outdoor spaces.

1533
02:26:49,000 --> 02:27:04,500
So we would like to see the DOT come up with different requirements for a school property or some property that's used for many individuals instead of just a single-family home.

1534
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:12,000
So thank you very much for listening, and I'd be glad to entertain any questions.

1535
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,500
Thank you for your testimony.

1536
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:28,500
And as you know, I thank you for the kind words about my passionate plea for Bedford, but you also know that that bill went down in flames.

1537
02:27:28,500 --> 02:27:38,000
So if I can't get it done, we'll see what the committee wants to have done with this one.

1538
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:46,000
But that said, seriously, are there any questions of the representative from members of the committee?

1539
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Representative Peters.

1540
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:55,000
In the write-up, they used the words in bold, after confirmation that they qualified.

1541
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:07,500
Does that confirmation criteria that was written back then, 30 years ago, still apply to today's criteria for confirmation to put up a sound barrier?

1542
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:10,500
Thank you, Representative, for that question.

1543
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:24,500
Yes, based on discussions with the DOT, those promises still are the same promises that were made before, obviously by different people, but they are the same requirements.

1544
02:28:24,500 --> 02:28:39,000
and these neighborhoods were told at the time, according to all the eyewitnesses from the 1980s, who said, yes, we were told when that happens, we will get barriers.

1545
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:47,000
And maybe money was allocated at the time to do that, but it did not happen.

1546
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:54,500
And based on all their criteria that the DOT has, we do qualify for that.

1547
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:58,500
Any further questions from members of the committee?

1548
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:00,500
Seeing none, thank you.

1549
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:14,500
And I would call Assistant Commissioner from the New Hampshire DOT, Bill Kess, to speak, and the department, or at least Bill, is in opposition to the bill.

1550
02:29:14,500 --> 02:29:16,500
Good afternoon, committee.

1551
02:29:16,500 --> 02:29:20,500
Thank you for letting me address the bill.

1552
02:29:20,500 --> 02:29:35,000
Even though I did sign on the bill in opposition, I think my point is more that it is kind of a redundant bill, as Representative Somsich had noted.

1553
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:46,000
He had introduced the bill before some of the work this summer and fall with the GASA process and the 10-year plan.

1554
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:53,500
and sound walls in Portsmouth for the Panaway Manor and Rockingham Avenue neighborhoods are included.

1555
02:29:53,500 --> 02:30:10,000
Part of that is driven by a project that is being developed right now to utilize the shoulders of 95 in advance and over the high-level bridge to ease congestion during summer months.

1556
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:35,500
So with that project, and that's a federal aid project, that can be considered, that can be interpreted as a, what they call a type one project, a project to add capacity, which does require us to evaluate noise impacts and to mitigate those noise impacts associated with that added capacity.

1557
02:30:35,500 --> 02:30:45,500
So at the time I think the representative was introducing this bill, we were just completing those, that noise analysis.

1558
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:53,000
And as I said, the results were that Panaway Manor and Rockingham Avenue are eligible.

1559
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:04,500
The New Franklin School, again, based on our longstanding and established policy, and very similar to Tiberi Lane, it didn't have the density.

1560
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:07,500
It did not meet the requirements.

1561
02:31:07,500 --> 02:31:14,500
The noise thresholds were met, but the cost reasonableness for our policy weren't met.

1562
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:40,500
So the one other thing, and we assumed when we had done the fiscal note that it was going to be turnpike funded because it is on the turnpike, and we did initially program this with turnpike funds through the 10-year plan process and with the advent of the new infrastructure bill.

1563
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:48,500
and part of the desires of the community to have it done sooner rather than later.

1564
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:56,500
In short, the state funds are down and federal funds are up with the infrastructure bill.

1565
02:31:56,500 --> 02:32:16,000
And where it's associated with a federal aid capacity improvement project, we have programmed these sound walls as part of the federal program and to be done beginning in 2023, which is in keeping, I think, with the bill.

1566
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:19,500
So that's all I had, I'd entertain.

1567
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:21,500
Thank you.

1568
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:24,000
Any questions from the committee?

1569
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:35,500
I would ask that since the governor has not transmitted the 10-year transportation plan to us yet, that any questions you ask Mr.

1570
02:32:35,500 --> 02:32:56,000
Cass about this is what he has said is in the draft and how it's being handled to take care of what Representative Sonsis has been asking for as far as the sound walls, maybe not all of them, but that.

1571
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:02,000
So please, no extraneous questions on the 10-year plan at this point.

1572
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:09,500
We will have several days of which we can talk to the department about that.

1573
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:11,500
Representative Query.

1574
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:13,500
Thank you.

1575
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:21,000
We will have several days of which we can talk to the department about that.

1576
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Representative Query.

1577
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Thank you.

1578
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:36,000
My question is just kind of surrounding, so I understand the density is for homes and places of, like, where people live.

1579
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:48,500
is there any mechanism or way that you measure you know more public spaces whether that's parks or recreation areas, or in this case, schools?

1580
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:57,500
Is there a way that you handle those differently, or are they under the same as living areas?

1581
02:33:57,500 --> 02:33:59,500
They are.

1582
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:04,500
We We make a calculation to essentially do an equivalency.

1583
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:12,500
And as Representative Somsich noted, it is kind of based on the lineal foot of frontage.

1584
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:24,500
So that frontage along the highway and the various spaces or uses are converted into an equivalent number of receptors that would be benefited.

1585
02:34:24,500 --> 02:34:27,000
Does that answer your question?

1586
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Yeah.

1587
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,500
Any further questions of the department on this bill?

1588
02:34:33,500 --> 02:34:35,500
Representative Newman.

1589
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:37,500
Yes.

1590
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:39,500
Thank you.

1591
02:34:39,500 --> 02:34:41,500
Mr.

1592
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:57,500
Kass, is there any, in your experience with trying to accommodate sound barriers, is there any other area that has waited more than 30 years, or is this like the longest one?

1593
02:34:57,500 --> 02:35:01,000
The short answer is I don't know.

1594
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Certainly that neighborhood has been there, and the interstate through there was originally built in the early 70s.

1595
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I'm sure there are other areas.

1596
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:17,000
You had referenced the one in Tiberi Lane.

1597
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,500
The Central New Hampshire Turnpike had been there since the 50s.

1598
02:35:22,500 --> 02:35:28,500
It was widened with the Airport Access Road in the late 1990s.

1599
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:53,500
So I don't know if there are any, but there are, part of our assessment, there are a number of places in a similar condition as Panaway Manor that are adjacent to a highway, have noise impacts, may have been there preceding the highway, but there isn't a capacity improvement.

1600
02:35:53,500 --> 02:36:02,500
There isn't a project in the area there that warrants or allows us to look at sound barriers.

1601
02:36:02,500 --> 02:36:20,000
So we did an assessment, and there are, you know, I think we identified 48 or 50 other areas around the state that have maybe not the same degree but are in a similar situation.

1602
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:30,000
And if it was elected to try to mitigate noise at all of those, it was a substantial dollar amount.

1603
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:41,500
So a big part of what we look at with our policy is trying to treat everybody kind of the same and equitable.

1604
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:46,000
That's behind some of the cost reasonableness as well.

1605
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Representative Faulkner.

1606
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:58,500
The question I have is looking at what might be the source of people's belief that there was a promise here.

1607
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:14,500
Were these sound barriers presented as a mitigation measure and an environmental assessment or some similar documentation that we can look to, or is it basically conversations that people might have had?

1608
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:18,500
You put me in an awkward position here.

1609
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:32,000
I didn't want to necessarily refute that, but it has been brought up in the past, and as far as I know, there weren't any promises made.

1610
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:39,500
I mentioned the time frame because, granted, that neighborhood was there long before the interstate.

1611
02:37:39,500 --> 02:37:43,500
The interstate was built in the early 70s.

1612
02:37:43,500 --> 02:37:49,000
I think Spalding Turnpike work was done in around the 80s.

1613
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:58,500
The federal requirements in the department didn't have a noise policy relative to noise abatement until the early, mid-1990s.

1614
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:20,000
So I can't verify that there was any promises made or anything like that, but I do know in that time frame, we really weren't looking at, it wasn't a requirement, it wasn't something that was looked at in terms of noise abatement.

1615
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:41,000
The first noise barriers, sound abatement that I know we installed were part of the Nashua Central Turnpike widening that was begun in the mid-1990s, and that's when the issue of noise abat stuff first became something that we started to address.

1616
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Representative Edgar.

1617
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Thank you, Mr.

1618
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Chairman.

1619
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Okay, stay on.

1620
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Thank you for taking this question, Assistant Commissioner.

1621
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:16,000
it appears that, or I guess to me the question I have is, there seem to be like three areas that are associated in the area of this new project in Portsmouth, and is it that there's two of them will qualify for your present standards?

1622
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I don't have the full report in front of me.

1623
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:28,000
There were more than these three areas that have been mentioned that were evaluated.

1624
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:38,500
We evaluated the whole area, and I think there were six or seven, I think we identified eight or nine areas.

1625
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:52,500
Some of them ran together, so there were probably, and I can get the exact number, but I think there were like six or seven that were evaluated.

1626
02:39:52,500 --> 02:40:06,500
And of those, the two that we've mentioned, Pannoy Manor and Rockingham Avenue, did meet the criteria, and the other ones, including the New Franklin School, did not.

1627
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:08,500
Okay.

1628
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:11,000
And I'm not as familiar.

1629
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Oh, excuse me, Mr.

1630
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Chairman, if I continue.

1631
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Thank you.

1632
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:24,000
With the Franklin School, is it actually in the area of this new project?

1633
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:27,500
Yes, it's right adjacent to 95, right.

1634
02:40:27,500 --> 02:40:29,500
Thank you, Mr.

1635
02:40:29,500 --> 02:40:31,500
Chairman.

1636
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:44,500
Now, one of the 10-year plan hearings I was at, it was mentioned that the kids can't even play outside for recess because of the noise.

1637
02:40:44,500 --> 02:40:55,000
I just want to know how you fit that into your criteria for importance to be able to meet the criteria.

1638
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Thank you very much.

1639
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Sure.

1640
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Thank you, Mr.

1641
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Chairman.

1642
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Yeah, no, like I said, you know, we look at the frontage.

1643
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:13,000
I mean, there is a calculation equivalently determined.

1644
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:30,500
We look at it's not based on the number of students or people there, but it's looked at the lineal frontage along the turnpike and equated into a number of receptors for the outdoor areas.

1645
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:38,000
So I know there's a playground, there's a ball field, and there's several areas there.

1646
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:44,500
So based on that, there was an equivalency for a number of receptors.

1647
02:41:44,500 --> 02:41:54,000
But again, just the long spread out frontage of it makes it difficult to reach the cost effectiveness criteria.

1648
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Thank you.

1649
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Any further questions?

1650
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Representative Thompson.

1651
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Good afternoon, Commissioner Cass.

1652
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Has there been any other – I'm not an engineer.

1653
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:14,000
I've spent my whole life in the construction business, but I'm not an engineer.

1654
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Are there any other considerations given to other methods of producing these sound barriers other than the million-dollar tag that's hooked to this one?

1655
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,500
And I specifically refer to...

1656
02:42:28,500 --> 02:42:41,000
From time to time, you folks have excess material on your highway projects, and you build berms generally in the median from those excess materials.

1657
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Why couldn't that be done in some of these areas if the right of way is wide enough?

1658
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:56,500
It certainly wouldn't allow a barrier to be used as a graffiti site.

1659
02:42:56,500 --> 02:43:01,500
And it would be a no-maintenance solution to the problem.

1660
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:09,000
It seems like there should be other considerations given to some of these areas that...

1661
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,500
Is there a question here?

1662
02:43:11,500 --> 02:43:13,500
Yeah, usually we do.

1663
02:43:13,500 --> 02:43:20,000
Usually we look real hard to try to make it meet the criteria.

1664
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:28,500
And usually from our screening, if it's way far apart, we're not going to meet the criteria.

1665
02:43:28,500 --> 02:43:52,000
If it's close, if it's just over or even near, that's when we will look a lot harder at either berms or berms in conjunction with walls, lowering, you know, having partial berm, partial wall on top of it to make it as cost effective as possible.

1666
02:43:52,000 --> 02:44:03,000
And there are areas where standalone berms do work, and there is area and there is room, and we have built those.

1667
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:13,500
There's an area in Nashua, just south of the Merrill's Marauders Bridge, where we did berm up and built berms there.

1668
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:23,000
I can tell you in the Portsmouth area, the berms would not be effective because it is very dense.

1669
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:30,000
It's the turnpike, the fence, and all these neighborhoods, and a berm wouldn't fit.

1670
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:47,500
But we do look primarily to reduce the cost, whether it's a berm standalone or at least berming up some of the materials so the wall height is less and as cost effective as possible.

1671
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:52,000
Any further questions of the department on this bill?

1672
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Representative Cloutier.

1673
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Now?

1674
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Okay, good.

1675
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
I'm sorry.

1676
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Still getting used to these mics.

1677
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Thank you.

1678
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Okay, good.

1679
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
I'm sorry.

1680
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Still getting used to these mics.

1681
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Thank you.

1682
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:33,000
In regards to this bill, as far as funding, is the described project in this bill, do you know, does it qualify for any funding from the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure plan, even though it's on a turnpike?

1683
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Yes, it does.

1684
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Thank you.

1685
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:45,500
qualify for any funding from the recently passed bipartisan infrastructure plan, even though it's on a turnpike?

1686
02:45:45,500 --> 02:45:47,500
Yes, it does.

1687
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:49,500
It does qualify.

1688
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:51,500
Yes.

1689
02:45:51,500 --> 02:45:53,500
Okay.

1690
02:45:53,500 --> 02:45:56,000
And a follow-up, please, Mr.

1691
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Chairman.

1692
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:07,500
Do sound barriers built along interstate highways, do they also qualify for funding under the recently bipartisan infrastructure plan?

1693
02:46:07,500 --> 02:46:09,500
Yes.

1694
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:12,000
In keeping with our policy.

1695
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:23,500
In other words, they do qualify for federal funding, but they still need to meet the criteria established in the noise mitigation policy.

1696
02:46:23,500 --> 02:46:25,500
Okay.

1697
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:28,000
A further question, please, Mr.

1698
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Chairman.

1699
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,500
Does that include the standard?

1700
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:38,000
Is the standard the same for both turnpikes and interstate highways?

1701
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:41,000
They've got to meet certain criteria.

1702
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Yes, yeah.

1703
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:54,000
We have one policy, and it's based on the federal guidelines, and it's applied consistently whether it's state turnpike-funded or federally funded.

1704
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Okay.

1705
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:00,500
So just to be clear, a final question, Mr.

1706
02:47:00,500 --> 02:47:02,500
Chairman.

1707
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:06,500
So it's clear the policy is the same.

1708
02:47:06,500 --> 02:47:22,500
whether a sound barrier was built along a turnpike or an interstate highway could qualify for funding under the recent, whatever the state gets from the recently passed a bipartisan infrastructure plan.

1709
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:24,500
Yes, that's right.

1710
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:26,500
Okay.

1711
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:30,000
Thank you very much for your question.

1712
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Thank you, Mr.

1713
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Chairman.

1714
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
You're welcome.

1715
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Any other questions?

1716
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:43,500
I do have one clarifying question before we close out here.

1717
02:47:43,500 --> 02:48:01,000
Listening to what both the sponsor and you have said sitting there, the vast majority of what is being asked for in this bill will be presented to us as part of the 10-year plan.

1718
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Is that correct?

1719
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Yes.

1720
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
It is, yes.

1721
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Thank you.

1722
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:16,000
That might clarify some questions people have on how they wanna handle this bill.

1723
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
Thank you.

1724
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Thank you.

1725
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:23,500
Has anybody not testified wishing to testify?

1726
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:25,500
I see none.

1727
02:48:25,500 --> 02:48:33,000
Is anybody who testified once want to testify again and it better be very short?

1728
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Yes, Representative Sons Thank you, Mr.

1729
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Chairman.

1730
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:46,500
I just wanted to respond to Representative Thompson's question, which I think was a really good question.

1731
02:48:46,500 --> 02:49:00,500
I'm a material scientist by training, and I wanted to just let you know that the Panaway Manner neighborhood used to be surrounded by a lot of trees.

1732
02:49:00,500 --> 02:49:05,500
And they all got cut down when the expansion happened.

1733
02:49:05,500 --> 02:49:11,000
And when that happened, the noise level went up right away.

1734
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,000
So trees do something, do help.

1735
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:31,500
But I also want to mention that in Denmark now, there are several companies now that are taking old generation wind turbine blades and chopping them up and using them very effectively for noise abatement.

1736
02:49:31,500 --> 02:49:33,500
Thank you.

1737
02:49:33,500 --> 02:49:42,500
There being no other testimony on this bill, I will close the public hearing on House Bill 1593.

1738
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:57,000
I will now open the executive session on House Bill 1593, the act requiring Department of Transportation to elect Soundberry as on Interstate 95 in the City of Portsmouth.

1739
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Any general discussion from members of the committee?

1740
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Seeing none, And what is from members of the committee?

1741
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Seeing none, what is the pleasure of the committee in regards to this bill?

1742
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Somebody say something.

1743
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Representative McConkie.

1744
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Mr.

1745
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:34,500
Chairman, understanding that much of this is going to be forthcoming in the 10-year plan when it's revealed, and the parts, as I understand, don't meet the standard, I move ITL.

1746
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:39,500
Representative McConkie moves inexpedient to legislate on House Bill 1593.

1747
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:41,500
Is there a second?

1748
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:46,000
Representative Eaton seconds the motion of inexpedient to legislate.

1749
02:50:46,000 --> 02:51:11,500
I will say that I am going to vote in favor of inexpedient to legislate, and I would ask that the sponsor work closely with DOT as we go forward through the 10-year process to make sure that his desires continue to be known as well as those of his constituents.

1750
02:51:11,500 --> 02:51:18,000
You may not win much more, but at least you've gotten some progress.

1751
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Is there any other discussion on the bill?

1752
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Representative Cloutier.

1753
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Thank you.

1754
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Any further comments or discussion on the motion of inexpedient to legislate?

1755
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Representative Query.

1756
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,500
I'll make this really quick.

1757
02:51:36,500 --> 02:51:51,000
Just to further from Representative Cloutier's point, we heard testimony last session from someone who said that she'd been working on this since 1993, before I was even born.

1758
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:57,500
So I'm very glad to see that this is finally making it somewhere.

1759
02:51:57,500 --> 02:52:19,500
But I think something that I will be working on over the summer, and if I am honored enough to be reelected and put back on this committee, I think something that we should work towards is readjusting how we qualify for sound barriers.

1760
02:52:19,500 --> 02:52:35,500
I think there are some oversights just because of the times, and there are some concerns with, as we move towards electric vehicles, how those different vehicles will cause different sound issues.

1761
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:37,500
Thank you.

1762
02:52:37,500 --> 02:52:39,500
Representative Jack.

1763
02:52:39,500 --> 02:52:41,500
Thank you.

1764
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:43,500
Mr.

1765
02:52:43,500 --> 02:52:54,000
Cass, isn't it true that these are federal regulations and so the state is not at liberty to modify the criteria?

1766
02:52:54,000 --> 02:53:04,000
Please come up because this is being live streamed and people need to be able to hear what you're saying.

1767
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Yes and no.

1768
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Not to be confusing, but to be precise, there are federal regulations.

1769
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:19,500
It is a federal regulation that we need to have a sound, a noise policy.

1770
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:30,000
The specifics of that noise policy, we do have some discretion on how the thresholds are established and things like that.

1771
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:44,500
And I think, Representative Graham, you know that there were, in past years, I forget how many years ago, there were study commissions to look at some of those.

1772
02:53:44,500 --> 02:53:54,000
And for instance, I remember providing some of the testimony, there are some states that have very lenient thresholds.

1773
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,000
There are some that have very stringent thresholds.

1774
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:06,000
And I think we, New Hampshire, fell kind of in the middle of the pack there.

1775
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:17,500
So, yes, it is a federal requirement to have a policy, but some of the elements of the policy are at our discretion.

1776
02:54:17,500 --> 02:54:35,000
But it is a requirement to establish some of those criterias and apply them uniformly and consistently so there's not perceptions of favoritism from one area of the state or one community to the other.

1777
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:40,500
So that's what we try to do is apply it consistently.

1778
02:54:40,500 --> 02:54:42,500
Thank you, Representative Faulkner.

1779
02:54:42,500 --> 02:54:46,000
And we're not reopening all the questioning.

1780
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Okay.

1781
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Okay, there you go.

1782
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
I tried it before.

1783
02:54:52,000 --> 02:55:17,000
We saw that there's a whole list of projects, especially those that are not associated with a current highway improvement project, and that we need to have some mechanism for setting priorities that is objective and not whoever yells the loudest or has the friends in high places or whatever.

1784
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:25,500
I think that doing this in a way that is systematic and fair to everybody is important.

1785
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:28,000
I would agree with that.

1786
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:48,000
And I think representative query has a good point of at some point we need to relook at what the criteria within the state of New Hampshire is for sound walls and where we will spend the money on them.

1787
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:53,000
But that is not what we are looking at today.

1788
02:55:53,000 --> 02:56:07,500
And we can discuss that tomorrow or during any of our work sessions with DOT on the 10-year plan on what the criteria is and how it gets changed.

1789
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:17,000
But right now we have a motion in front of us of inexpedient to legislate on House Bill 1593.

1790
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Any further discussion on the motion?

1791
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Seeing none, the clerk will call the roll.

1792
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Representative McConkie.

1793
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Aye.

1794
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Representative Summerhill.

1795
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Aye.

1796
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Representative Fidolfi.

1797
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Yes.

1798
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Representative Blasek.

1799
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Yes.

1800
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
Representative Gagney.

1801
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Yes.

1802
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Representative Thompson.

1803
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Yes.

1804
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Representative Blasek?

1805
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Yes.

1806
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Representative Gagney?

1807
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Yes.

1808
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Representative Thompson?

1809
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Yes.

1810
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Representative Boyd is still not here.

1811
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Representative Cloutier?

1812
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Yes.

1813
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Representative Edgar?

1814
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Aye.

1815
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Representative Talersky?

1816
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Yes.

1817
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Clerk votes yes.

1818
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Representative Abbott?

1819
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Yes.

1820
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Representative Faulkner?

1821
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
Yes.

1822
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Representative Newman?

1823
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Yes.

1824
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Representative Eaglen?

1825
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Yes.

1826
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Representative Eaglen?

1827
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Yes.

1828
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
Representative Eaglen?

1829
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Yes.

1830
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Representative Newman?

1831
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Yes.

1832
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Representative Eaton?

1833
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Aye.

1834
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Representative Peterson?

1835
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Yes.

1836
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Representative Query?

1837
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Yes.

1838
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Representative Bunker?

1839
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Yes.

1840
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
And Mr.

1841
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Chairman?

1842
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Yes.

1843
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:13,000
The vote being 18 to 0, the motion of inexpedient to legislate.

1844
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:20,000
The vote being 18 to 0, the motion of inexpedient to legislate is adopted.

1845
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Is there any objection to the consent calendar?

1846
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:33,500
Seeing none, it will go on the consent calendar, and I thank everybody for their attention on this bill.

1847
02:58:33,500 --> 02:58:44,000
Before I say we're finished for the day, I would like to remind everyone that we start at 930 tomorrow morning.

1848
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:58,000
We have three which could be contentious bills, two dealing with the sale of the Lakes region facility and one dealing with state funds for new passenger rail.

1849
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:17,500
It is my intention not to exact any of those three bills tomorrow, because no matter what we do, we're going to have to have more thoughtful discussion and maybe amendments to any of them as we go forward.

1850
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:25,000
So I would rather put that off after people have thought about it and looked.

1851
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:29,500
So we will not have any executive sessions tomorrow.

1852
02:59:29,500 --> 02:59:55,500
And then in the afternoon, we will be hearing an orientation from the department on the 10-year plan and available funding, how it was developed, not necessarily everything that's in it because the governor still has it, and he has until the end of the week to give it to the legislature.

1853
02:59:55,500 --> 03:00:12,500
But it will be useful for all of us to know what funds were available, what funds became available from the federal government, and how they were utilized, as we just found out today.

1854
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:16,500
They can be partially used for sound walls.

1855
03:00:16,500 --> 03:00:22,500
But there's lots of other uses they can be used for, too.

1856
03:00:22,500 --> 03:00:32,500
So that's why I've asked for the department to spend as much time in the afternoon as the committee wants.

1857
03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:41,000
For those of you who will not be able to be here, remember it is live streamed.

1858
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:51,000
You can watch it, and the department will be sending out their presentation to all the members of the committee.

1859
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:54,500
So you will have a copy tonight.

1860
03:00:54,500 --> 03:00:56,500
All right.

1861
03:00:56,500 --> 03:00:58,500
Okay.

1862
03:00:58,500 --> 03:01:00,500
Never mind.

1863
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:05,000
I don't check my email while I'm sitting here.

1864
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:09,000
So it is already out in your hands.

1865
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
So that's helpful.

1866
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:22,500
And it will be a good start for when we begin process on other bills that deal with funding and the 10-year plan.

1867
03:01:22,500 --> 03:01:24,500
So thank you all.

1868
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:26,500
Representative Abbott.

1869
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:29,000
Yes, I just wondered, Mr.

1870
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:34,500
Chairman, if it's all right if we leave our papers here.

1871
03:01:34,500 --> 03:01:39,000
Yeah, we'll be back in the same room tomorrow.

1872
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:51,000
but after we leave tomorrow, whenever you leave tomorrow, we will have to clean up because state and federal is in here on Friday.

1873
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Representative Gagne.

1874
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Try it again.

1875
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:58,000
I've left the representative's stuff here.

1876
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
It's good.

1877
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:07,500
It's good because the committee assistant will make sure it gets into the right place.

1878
03:02:07,500 --> 03:02:09,500
That's fine, too.

1879
03:02:09,500 --> 03:02:13,500
I mean, he'll probably ask, but it's fine.

1880
03:02:13,500 --> 03:02:15,500
Representative Clear?

1881
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:17,500
Clear?

1882
03:02:17,500 --> 03:02:22,500
Do we have drawers assigned to us yet in there?

1883
03:02:22,500 --> 03:02:24,500
Yes.

1884
03:02:24,500 --> 03:02:30,000
Anything else for me or for the rest of the committee?

1885
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:35,500
If not, I will see you all bright and early tomorrow.

1886
03:02:35,500 --> 03:02:40,500
I thank you all for your patience and work today.

1887
03:02:40,500 --> 03:02:44,000
We got a lot of work done.

1888
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:49,000
So I appreciate it, and we can keep moving on.

1889
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
Thank you.

1890
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Thank you.

1891
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Thank you.

1892
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Thank you.

1893
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Thank you.

1894
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Thank you.
