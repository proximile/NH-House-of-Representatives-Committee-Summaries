00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something the committee
 
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
should take into account too
 
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
can inquire with one question sure and
 
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
in a situation where one person own is
 
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
in a situation where one person own is
unmarried

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
unmarried
 
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
owns owns a house or property
 
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
is it why would that long-term living
 
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
partner have some type of vested
 
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
interest in the property i guess that's
 
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
the concern i would have
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
i i well just the
 
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question but
 
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
right off the top my head i would say
 
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
probably only if they invested in that
 
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
property also
 
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
so if they have a clear track or trail
 
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
of investment if they're paying half the
 
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
mortgage or something like that
 
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
but if it was fully owned by one partner
 
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
i don't think they would have
 
00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily access to it although i
 
00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
think that kind of question would be a
 
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised thank you for your
 
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
testimony the witness is excused thank
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
how do i do this
 
00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 align:start position:0%
ah thank you i'm new at this
 
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm chelsea christensen and
 
00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully in
 
00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
what i have to say my answer a lot of
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
the questions that i'm hearing you ask
 
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just give you a little background
 
00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
on my story and why i approached senator
 
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
sherman on this bill
 
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
i was in a relationship with someone for
 
00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
it was more on the traditional side of
 
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
things we were together had two children
 
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
bought a house together that kind of
 
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.270 align:start position:0%
bought a house together that kind of
thing

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
when it ended i learned through the
 
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 align:start position:0%
process of separation
 
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
that the laws are
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
very challenging for someone in my
 
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.710 align:start position:0%
very challenging for someone in my
situation

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.229 align:start position:0%
situation
um

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
where this could apply to a lot of
 
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
different types of relationships you
 
00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
know whether it's same-sex and you know
 
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
what have you there's a lot of different
 
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.430 align:start position:0%
what have you there's a lot of different
scenarios

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
um me being more in a traditional sense
 
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
um where we you know cohabitated raise
 
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
um where we you know cohabitated raise
children

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
my situation was i felt that
 
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
the way the laws are designed in new
 
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire for divorce it's a very 50 50
 
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
state when you're separating with
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
children it's 50 50 in just the means of
 
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
child support
 
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.270 align:start position:0%
child support
um

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why divorce laws are said the
 
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
way they are is because traditionally
 
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a scenario where you
 
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
know someone stays home raises the
 
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
children the other person goes off and
 
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
earns for the household they save for
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
their retirement they do these things
 
00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 align:start position:0%
they're benefiting from the other
 
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
partners staying home keeping things
 
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
going while they're off doing their job
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
and saving for retirement and what have
 
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.350 align:start position:0%
and saving for retirement and what have
you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
when you separate in that situation when
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
you're not married there's no protection
 
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.110 align:start position:0%
you're not married there's no protection
to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
help the other person have a consistent
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
lifestyle when you leave as far as you
 
00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
know there was some huge discrepancies
 
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the separation where yes i had child
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
support but he continued to live in the
 
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
household which we did split and to
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions about how
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
do you split a house
 
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
there is currently
 
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
coverage in new hampshire for what's
 
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
called tenants in common and we did
 
00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
invest in the house together so we were
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
able to prove that you know that needed
 
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
to be split 50 50. so he did buy me out
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
of my portion of the house so if that
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
answers any of those questions
 
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
but as far as
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
anything else i i was expected because i
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're familiar with the
 
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
law code air versus code air in the
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire if one person is
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
determined that they pay full child
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
support then the recipient of the child
 
00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 align:start position:0%
support is expected to pay for
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
everything for the child
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
as far as camps and after school
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
activities and things like that and they
 
00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 align:start position:0%
can't go to the other person paying the
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
child support for additional like you
 
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
know let's split the ballet and all that
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's expected that that person pays for
 
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
it's expected that that person pays for
everything

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
that is what i do i pay for everything
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
for my children which i'm happy to do
 
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
because i want them to have those
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities but then there's a
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
discrepancy where he's the breadwinner
 
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
he's saved for retirement so on and so
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
forth when we separated i just get child
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
support i pay for everything
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know he's living in a nice house i'm
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
in a one-bedroom apartment with two kids
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
and two dogs and it it became very
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
difficult and i realized that when you
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
separate in that situation
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
the laws aren't there to protect me to
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
say well you also get 50 50 because you
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
each benefited from a 10-year
 
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
relationship you know you should also
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
get the alimony and the um you know half
 
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
of the retirement things like that
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's what you get when you get
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
divorced but when you get
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
separated in a domestic partnership
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's no protection there
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
so there's a huge discrepancy in
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know offering the same lifestyle for
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
the children in one household versus the
 
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.150 align:start position:0%
the children in one household versus the
other

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
other
and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know during the study maybe it's
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
determined that
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
how they decide on
 
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
what the benefits are when you separate
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
in a domestic partnership maybe there's
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
qualification things maybe it's length
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
of time maybe it's do you have children
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
together do you have assets things like
 
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
that um but it's it's been very
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
challenging in this process um because
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
it you know it's expected that i pay for
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
everything and then i also have to
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
maintain a household and everything else
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i don't make as much money and i
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
don't work the way he does and i have to
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
take a lot of time to run the kids and
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
things like that so the amount of money
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
that we're getting to help support the
 
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
two households is a is very off
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
i just looked at it and you know i
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
approached senator sherman because i
 
00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
said you know there should be something
 
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
that protects all different types of
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
relationships there isn't just you know
 
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
i was in more of a traditional sense of
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
a relationship but there's other
 
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
domestic partnerships you know they
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
might adopt children they might be in
 
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
the same situation
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
another example that was hard for me
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
during the separation is
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
his work was always based in other
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
states so i was able to get domestic
 
00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:04.950 align:start position:0%
states so i was able to get domestic
partnership

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare which was great but of course
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
the minute we separated he just canceled
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
it so whereas i was getting the benefit
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
of health care
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't do anything about it now
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm paying you know 450 for 450 a month
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
on my health care whereas i was getting
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
it for you know 100 a month and there's
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
just discrepancies like that that make
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
it very challenging in the state
 
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.990 align:start position:0%
it very challenging in the state
um

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty much all i had to
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
say i don't know if i should open it up
 
00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
for questions
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
the witness for a testimony okay if
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
there's anything i just want to say i
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't know you kind of cut short in
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
anticipation of questions senator
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
sherman left so
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
i just didn't know if he wanted me to
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
add to that but
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much why i feel like this
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony okay
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
witness is excused oh excuse me oh sorry
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
go ahead sorry
 
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
my mistake representative news you're
 
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
recognized i did have one question about
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
what is what is the impact of some of
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
the things that you're going through as
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
a custodial parent that you think might
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
be a little bit different
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
than a custodial parent
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
in a situation where a divorce has taken
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
place well in in my situation it's more
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure that my
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
children are maintaining the same
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
lifestyle that they're accustomed to in
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
two households
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
so not having enough money i feel that
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
the way the laws were designed in a
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
divorce they they look at that they look
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
at okay here you know for 10 years
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
you've been raising children together
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
and they've had a certain lifestyle when
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
you separate from a marriage let's make
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
sure that the children have an equal
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
opportunity in each household so there
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
is the alimony to help support you know
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
everything's based on income his income
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
is much higher than mine
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
so it's definitely something where
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
i feel like i'm struggling because i'm
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
trying to help my children have
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
maintained that same lifestyle and pay
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
for all their things and all that but
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
it's you know i haven't been able to i
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
mean up until recently i fortunately was
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
able to to get myself going with a new
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
home and that kind of thing it took a
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
while it took about three four years for
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
me to get to that point but you know i
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
was living in a one bedroom apartment
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
i feel if i had had the additional
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
income maybe the retirement things that
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
i can fall back on you know i don't have
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
the ability to save for retirement i
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
have no retirement i mean hopefully
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
maybe my house will give me some equity
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
but you know me helping him save her
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
retirement i didn't benefit from any of
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
that and i feel like alimony and things
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds would help me have a
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
nicer home for them and keep things a
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
little bit more consistent from
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
household to household
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i just feel like this bill is
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
pretty important for people in my
 
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.589 align:start position:0%
pretty important for people in my
situation

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman who made the
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
decision of
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
visitation rights for the children and
 
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
visitation rights for the children and
whatnot

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
so at least the good news about
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
separating when you when you're not
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
married is the state of new hampshire
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
does have
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty comprehensive
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
i guess if you want to call it parenting
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
plan or what have you when you separate
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
they look at the children and they look
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
at the income excuse me and they they do
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
separate things very well you go into
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
court together when you separate and you
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
you have to agree on a parenting plan
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
it's you know whether it's going to be
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
50 50 visitation or maybe one parent
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
works more and they travel more so the
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
other parent needs to take more
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility um but
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the children the laws
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
are there for that type of thing um
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
 
00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.870 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that answers your
question

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
yes it does okay
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
i was just curious because
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
you had to go before a judge in order to
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
get this right
 
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.670 align:start position:0%
get this right
yes

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we had to have court hearings
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing to agree we had
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
to have mediation and
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
it felt like a divorce at that point
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
when it came to
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
um you know making sure the children
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
were well cared for so i will say that
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
about new hampshire is that that that is
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
a positive thing it's just when it comes
 
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
a positive thing it's just when it comes
to

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
you know separating everything it
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
there's no protections for a domestic
 
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
there's no protections for a domestic
partnership

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
partnership
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
i i guess mike my question is kind of a
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
personal one
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
why did you choose not to get married
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
well and actually i'm glad you asked
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
that because i kind of wanted to respond
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the gentleman behind you i'm sorry i
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
didn't get your name but he he had
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know there should be
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
consequences what have you um i feel
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
that today things are so different and
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know in my situation i
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
i wanted to get married he did not want
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
to get married and it's not something
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
that you can really force on somebody he
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
just is one of those people that just
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to make that long-term
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
commitment so in my situation you know
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do the right thing raise
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
the children together and then of course
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know we grew apart so we
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
separated but it i for my children's
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
sake i thought it would be better for
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
them to grow up in a household with a
 
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.110 align:start position:0%
them to grow up in a household with a
traditional

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
situation but in my situation he was
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
unwilling to get married so it was
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
nothing i could could control and so
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
when he was saying you know maybe there
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
should be consequences but it's and i
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
agree with that because i i wish more
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
people would get married but i feel like
 
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.030 align:start position:0%
people would get married but i feel like
there's

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
so many things that are so different in
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
today's day and age that
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's harder and harder for people to
 
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.069 align:start position:0%
it's harder and harder for people to
feel

00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
feel
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
safe if you will about getting married i
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
think there's been so many horror
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
stories out there about horrible
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
divorces there's infidelity there's all
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
these things so i think it scares people
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
and so it puts a lot of people in a
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
situation like myself where there was
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
nothing i could do because i couldn't
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
seeing your hands raised i'm going to
 
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for her testimony okay
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public who
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
are in attendance who wish to testify
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that have not testified already
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
will now close the
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
we are now blessed with the presence of
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
the next hearing's not till not till 10
 
00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:19.110 align:start position:0%
the next hearing's not till not till 10
o'clock

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
just uh well i got everyone here
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
when we have just to make sure when we
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
do our committee reports
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
even if we want we won't mention which
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
bill this was
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative bradley probably
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
remembers if if i if i sign off on the
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
report and even if i sign off on it you
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
may want to just double check to make
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
the staff got that sign off because
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
there was a very well written report
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
although against what i wanted
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
it nevertheless didn't make it into the
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
calendar it was just a clerical
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
oversight but i know everyone works so
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
hard and diligent on their reports
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we would hate for that to happen
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
again so
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
we tried to just it never hurts the
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
what do you what do you mean follow up
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
with staff because if we send
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
the blurb to the chair and the
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
administrator that
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
as far as i know that is uh all we need
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
you are correct but i'm just saying
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
no there is always the possibility of
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
human error
 
00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519 align:start position:0%
i i know that's surprising to hear that
 
00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:32.150 align:start position:0%
i i know that's surprising to hear that
i

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
i may make a mistake or someone else may
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
make a mistake but
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
due to a just pure clerical oversight
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
said report didn't make it into the
 
00:14:42.639 --> 00:14:45.110 align:start position:0%
said report didn't make it into the
calendar

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
so it to avoid that mistake it never
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
hurts to just follow up
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
to confirm it 100 that's all i'm saying
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
you don't have to and there's no it's up
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
so mr chair how do we find out whether
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
or not the report has made it into uh
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
where it needs to go
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
i would assume
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
obviously you won't know until the
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
calendar comes out but i would assume
 
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
calendar comes out but i would assume
that

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
you can just ask for a confirmation a
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
confirmation email hey did this
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
did you perceive it
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
if i literally attach the person to the
 
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:20.069 align:start position:0%
if i literally attach the person to the
email

00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
we'll try to encourage your response but
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
it can it's just
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
throwing it out there
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
do you always try to respond
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
to people when they're when their report
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
is approved
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
i i usually i tried to attach them i may
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
occasionally forget to hit reply all but
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
literally everyone's on the email thread
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
but i'm just saying it happened and
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's on my ultimates my
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility so it's
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
i take responsibility for it i'm just
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid happening again and i'm
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
just saying for that for the members it
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
would never hurt to
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
follow up it's just just a suggestion
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
it's not a rule
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
representing me i'm just i meant that
 
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:30.230 align:start position:0%
representing me i'm just i meant that
injustice

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
i would advise members to make sure that
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
their report
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
is in the report and and
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
see if they have any questions probably
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
before it gets into the
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
so for there was one in time a while ago
 
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.069 align:start position:0%
so for there was one in time a while ago
where

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
a report was severely truncated and i
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
didn't realize what it was so just check
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
what you sent to make sure that
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
if there's something wrong with it when
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
you when it's put in there that
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to correct it
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
we will be in the committee will be in
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
just making sure everyone's here
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
at this time we will now open the
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
executive session on
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%

00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
little bit confused why this wouldn't be
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
family law but that's that
 
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.789 align:start position:0%
family law but that's that
um

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
and secondly i'm
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of things we
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
heard from the testimony that i can
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
certainly sympathize
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
with the young lady and but i also do
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of these things are out
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the control of legislator and i do
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know you if you put both of your
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
names on as an example a checking
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
account because that was mentioned
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
anybody that has their name on a joint
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
checking account can can clean that
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
account out at any time regardless of
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
what their their marital status is
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
um or their living arrangement
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
furthermore i'm i'm still a little bit
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
confused on exactly what it is that
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
that they want to study and um other
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
than you know protecting your own assets
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
in a legal way i'm not really sure that
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's much much more that can be found
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis you're
 
00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.830 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis you're
recognized

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
well first off i'd like to say that
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
we're all preaching this as a free state
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
so if you didn't want to get married you
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to get married but you
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
should be protected and this is what she
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
is asking for is protection
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
protection and guidelines
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
like we have for married couple
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
i know of a couple they were gay but
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's beside the point
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
that the woman went to the hospital
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
they had lived together for 30 years
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
the daughter did not like
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
what had happened
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
but the other woman that lived the woman
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
passed away the one that lived she lost
 
00:30:27.679 --> 00:30:28.870 align:start position:0%
passed away the one that lived she lost
everything

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
she didn't even know her name was on the
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
house they found a way to sell it
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so it's need they need protection
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
they they have that now
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
in the gay community but we don't have
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
it out there
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
in the community that says if i don't
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
want to marry somebody
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
he can still clean out my bank account
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
if i'm stupid enough to put both both
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
names on it so
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to nothing's going to
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
do any harm to really
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh study this and find out what really
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
no need to apologize representative
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh we'll just
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative speak to you
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i you know i
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
agree with my colleague from portsmouth
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know i think i think there's use in
 
00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
in studying um the
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
unmarried cohabitants and you know
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
domestic partnerships i think and more
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
and more we're seeing that folks are
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
getting married at a younger at an older
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
age and um especially my generation i
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
know that i got married after being in a
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
relationship for five years um which
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
might have been for had not been for
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
covet but um but the thing was you know
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
we um i i think a big part of the issue
 
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:49.750 align:start position:0%
we um i i think a big part of the issue
is

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
these folks are you know
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
they care a lot about each other it's
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
really hard to discuss some of the
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
issues find especially financial issues
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
with your partner and when you're not in
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
that in that um
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
in a full like you know in a marriage um
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
it you know becomes even more difficult
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
but you know when you add kids into the
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
mix it becomes even more difficult um so
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
i i think that there is there is used to
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
studying um you know making sure that we
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
if if there are protections that need to
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
be added if there aren't protections
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
that need to be added um but at the end
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the day it's a study committee and
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's i think it's worth
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
the time for of the legislator to study
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.230 align:start position:0%
the time for of the legislator to study
it

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to just to echo
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative expedia's comments and
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
one of the other things i wanted to do
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
too is just
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
point out the fact that one of the
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
things that we are trying to do in this
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
state pretty desperately is to attract
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
young people to live here
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i think you know when you're a lot
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
of the people that we're trying to
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
attract are probably in these types of
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
relationships they haven't made the
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
decision to get married yet
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that we we don't have uh
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
some of these protections you know could
 
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:02.389 align:start position:0%
some of these protections you know could
be

00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh could potentially be a show stopper
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
for them um
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's just a study committee you know
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
this is not a
 
00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:11.190 align:start position:0%
this is not a
uh

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
this this bill does not include any
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to law
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh it really just
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a bill that would allow a
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
group of people to take a look at the
 
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
data to talk to more people to get a
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
clearer picture of where the problems
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
exist and where they don't exist and try
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
to develop some targeted solutions that
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
will help
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
not only help these people but also help
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire become more attractive to
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
three issues
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
first and not the least of which we are
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
inundated with study committees um so we
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
have to be very judicious on on what we
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
choose to study
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
this particular issue when we legalize
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
same-sex marriage
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
it was for exactly this purpose so that
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
the people in these marriages would have
 
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.869 align:start position:0%
the people in these marriages would have
protections

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
protections
 
00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:12.869 align:start position:0%
protections
so

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
they do have protections it's under the
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
law it's it's marriage that's how you
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
get into it to protect your assets other
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
than you know the moral and religious
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
aspects of why you want to get married
 
00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
it provides distinct legal protections
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
second of all or third of all lastly the
 
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.069 align:start position:0%
second of all or third of all lastly the
um

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
prenuptial agreements
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
married couples can enter them and so
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
can non-married couples
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you get into a relationship you can
 
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:41.909 align:start position:0%
if you get into a relationship you can
get

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
what is in fact a prenup but it's a
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
contract where you say this is mine this
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
is yours if we split this happens
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
so there's already in-law mechanisms and
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
tools to use to protect assets
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think that this is a
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
good use of our time to study something
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's already
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
protected if you just do a little
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
research on your own
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out just a couple of
 
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.270 align:start position:0%
i'd like to point out just a couple of
things

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
in in the ladies testimony
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
for one she pointed out that in law
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
children have rights they we've done
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
bills and we've produced laws to protect
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
children no matter whether it's in a
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
cohabitating or in a marriage situation
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i thought that was enlightening
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
secondly she said i'm living in a
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
one-room apartment at one point
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
and then later in her testimony she
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
talked about having in a house
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm going
 
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
so i'm going
okay

00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
so she hasn't as
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
bad office she tried to portray herself
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
is the state
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
gonna waste time and money
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
on another as my fellow representatives
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
said another study committee
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
and last but not least
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
when is the state ever want to get into
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
protecting the people that
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to protect themselves in the
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
very beginning and yet at the end come
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
back and say oh i need protection i need
 
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.470 align:start position:0%
back and say oh i need protection i need
protection

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
should have had that before you thought
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
before you got into it thank you mr
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
chairman and i will be voting
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
i've read a couple of things that if we
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
look at the law and research it will
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
understand why we should vote itl
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
we heard the first testimony about this
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
bill 45 minutes ago
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm unsure of what the laws are here
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire about
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
checking accounts i know from experience
 
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
with someone who's divorcing in florida
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
that a joint account in a divorce at
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
least there may be here
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
and you can divorce if you're married
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
that then
 
00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.829 align:start position:0%
that then
the

00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
assets in that account
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
is noted
 
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.270 align:start position:0%
is noted
and

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
at least there are some protections
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
about where they can split whatever is
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
left in a joint account because that
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
legal thing is going on so we had a
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
woman come in here
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
and someone used the word betrayed
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
what her situation was her situation was
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
she had a one-room apartment
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
took her three years with the kids to
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
get a house don't know what kind of
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
house it is
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't know what their life what the
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
children's lifestyle was before that
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
and in a divorce
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
they not only consider child support
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
they also take a look at
 
00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.870 align:start position:0%
they also take a look at
the

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
salary of each party
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
and determine
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
whether there's equity in that
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that's where you get the alimony
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
thing so part of that is to be able to
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that the children if they
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
split and they live in two houses have a
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
similar kind of lifestyle
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
in both of those situations
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
but anybody
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have isn't married or
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
according to
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
some testimony for other members
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
that same-sex people
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
have protection
 
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
have protection
well

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
this was a situation that we heard the
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
testimony on and the testimony was
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that this woman with her kids obviously
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
at least in my opinion from her
 
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.829 align:start position:0%
at least in my opinion from her
testimony

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
was that they do not have the same
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
standard of living and if she were
 
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.349 align:start position:0%
standard of living and if she were
divorced

00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
divorced
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
and she had
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
the ability to be able to rely on the
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
divorce laws
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
she would have a much more equal
 
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.870 align:start position:0%
she would have a much more equal
situation

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so i'm worried about the kids
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't care what the founders said
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know divorce was never a popular
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
thing until 50 years ago but now it is
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
so we should be concerned about what's
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
happening now
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
so giving given that what i've heard
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative conley mr chairman minus
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
um i guess of you
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
we're in the second year of a two-year
 
00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:43.430 align:start position:0%
we're in the second year of a two-year
term

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
um and i understand that there's some
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
hesitancy to uh seat
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
study committees in the second year of a
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
term in fact i ran against that
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
when my party was in the majority so i
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
guess i'm curious is this even
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
practically and logistically possible
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative marston please
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for your point of
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative morrison do you may you
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone please
 
00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.670 align:start position:0%
turn on your microphone please
apologize

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
no deference to the person that made the
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
motion but if i'm not correct i'd like
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
to be aware of that that a person who is
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
not a permanent member of the committee
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
cannot make a motion
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
on a bill
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for staying in point of order
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh two things number one when a point of
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
order is raised it has to be raised
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
immediately the motion has been
 
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.190 align:start position:0%
immediately the motion has been
already

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's been intervening business shall we
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
say so it's not timely to the but just
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
to clarify for the members of the public
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes is now a permanent
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
member of the committee
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that my understanding is uh she
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
actually that member would be permitted
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
to make
motions

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative collins may you ask the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
same question or i think you're asking
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
it the practicality of of this given
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's the second year
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding this is my humble
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
opinion alone
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
this would be reported out
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
before november 1st of 2022 so it could
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
the committee would conclude need to
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
conclude its work by then
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
so it would be able to perform its
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
function uh in
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
although we have a lot of commissions
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
and committees study committees and all
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
that i get that
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
i think if the topic or issues
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know if we as a body believe is
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
worthy of study and in need of study
 
00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:49.119 align:start position:0%
then it's
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay to put forward i personally i i
 
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.630 align:start position:0%
okay to put forward i personally i i
don't

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
i understand that and i sympathize for
 
00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
the testimony we received today but all
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
the issues raised are
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
are or could have already been addressed
 
00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:00.950 align:start position:0%
are or could have already been addressed
under

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
and when you put money into a joint
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
account especially someone who is
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
refusing to commit to a long-term
 
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.950 align:start position:0%
refusing to commit to a long-term
relationship

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
in fairness
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's a red flag
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
and we're not here to give financial
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to keep protect your assets
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
you keep them separate especially if
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're not married that's
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
i mean i so i'm not really sure what
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
what problem we would need to fix is not
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
already fixable under the existing law
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
and any changes we make
 
00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
we if we start going down that road the
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
reason why they abolished common law
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
marriages was that people who cohabitate
 
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.630 align:start position:0%
marriages was that people who cohabitate
together

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
for a certain period of time even if
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
they're just roommates and living
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
separate i mean there's arguments to be
 
00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:53.109 align:start position:0%
separate i mean there's arguments to be
made

00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know they want their marriage to be
 
00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
clear whether parties are married or not
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
because then if you live with someone
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
for a couple years and you separate then
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
you go and get married through an
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
official ceremony did you was your first
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
long-term cohabitation i mean
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of that was discussed and worked
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
out over you know a century of
 
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.950 align:start position:0%
out over you know a century of
litigation

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
so just we might be going backwards this
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
is my humble opinion
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative representative boardney
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
actually uh as far as
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
assets and a checking account are minor
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
to what really are the issues
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
we are looking at
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
assets like
 
00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:36.870 align:start position:0%
assets like
houses

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
retirement plans
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
those are important assets
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:46.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
if we make someone incident because they
 
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:52.839 align:start position:0%
no longer don't have
 
00:43:52.839 --> 00:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
no longer don't have
at

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
access to these assets
 
00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.829 align:start position:0%
access to these assets
that

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
reflects on
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
the state and the state has to take care
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
of incident people
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that there are some
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
good things to
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
discuss about this committee
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to support the itl motion
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative pantologist and after
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
that we'll move the question
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
in my day and age if you lived with some
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
one you had a red scarlet letter on you
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
and you couldn't do it
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
but nowadays it's a common thing
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we here at the state as
 
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.150 align:start position:0%
and we here at the state as
representatives

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
are here to protect everybody
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
and we say freedom every day
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
well freedom is the right to do what you
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
choose to do and i think this woman
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
brought up a lot of good points that
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
needed to be looked at
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
from the health insurance to the
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
retirement system and i would hope that
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
we would look at it and
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
study it
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
and maybe help her
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%

to introduce the bill
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%

i'll be very brief as it stands right
 
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.910 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief as it stands right
now

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
when a individual is arrested on one of
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
our warrants
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
we have 72 hours from the time they're
 
00:50:36.079 --> 00:50:37.829 align:start position:0%
we have 72 hours from the time they're
arrested

00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
for no fault to the county systems
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's fallen through the cracks at times
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
and we haven't been notified in a timely
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
manner so that 72 hour clock has already
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
began to run and at times when we're not
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
notified in time
 
00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're up against the wall trying to get
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
it done in time and we're coming from
 
00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
all over the state to make it happen
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
this this simple change would just put
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
the onus on the superintendent of the
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
county facilities
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
to notify us
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
as soon as they can and then the 72 hour
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
clock would start running once the
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
probation pro officer is notified
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative roy you recognized for a
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman uh thank
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question over here
 
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's right um
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not if you could explain to the
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
committee how it works i i know in
 
00:51:27.359 --> 00:51:28.870 align:start position:0%
committee how it works i i know in
massachusetts

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
if anyone runs a record check a bop
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
border parole
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
probation check it automatically flags
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
the parole probation officer that
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
someone's looking at one of their guys
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have a similar system in new
 
00:51:41.359 --> 00:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
we don't have a similar system in new
hampshire

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question no sir we do not
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to you
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to the individual police officer
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
or the facility to notify us
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
would it not be better for us to do
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
something similar where you would get an
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
automatic hit that someone had run a
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
record on one of your guys
 
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
certainly we'd love to have that
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we could talk to the ncic folks
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe set something up and talk to
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts as well that'd be a great
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you mr
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for your testimony what
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
is i heard the word notify many times
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
can you clarify what exactly would be
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
required to satisfy this bill
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
it would just be notification to the
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
probation parole officer we also have
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
the 24-hour
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
24 7 control room at the men's prison
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
as soon as they were notified they would
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
then contact the probationary officer if
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's off hours so it's just the
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
notification to the ppo
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
that their individual had been arrested
 
00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:44.230 align:start position:0%
that their individual had been arrested
okay

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
your testimony um the superintendents
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
a dozen of them behind you opposing this
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm assuming they're okay with it
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
i believe so sir we talked to the
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
superintendents and met with their
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee um to discuss this and
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
they asked in the first go around for an
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and uh
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
they're on the same page with us at this
 
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
they're on the same page with us at this
point

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative harry gathered
 
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.670 align:start position:0%
representative harry gathered
okay

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
i guess my the same question that i had
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
for the senator
 
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.990 align:start position:0%
for the senator
so

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.430 align:start position:0%
so
if

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
say someone's arrested today
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
so at that point they know that that
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
person um
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
um is on parole or probation or whatever
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
so today the 72 hours start today
 
00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.829 align:start position:0%
so today the 72 hours start today
correct

00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am all right
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
so follow up
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um all right so
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
with this new bill
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
or um
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
as i understand it it it the 72 hours
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
would not start until the probation
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
officer is notified
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
which more than likely will not be that
 
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.230 align:start position:0%
which more than likely will not be that
day

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
and let's say someone got arrested in an
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
evening okay so that person is probably
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
going to stay where they are to the next
 
00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.230 align:start position:0%
going to stay where they are to the next
day

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
before they go to valley street or
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
you're detaining a person
 
00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:18.710 align:start position:0%
you're detaining a person
okay

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
longer than necessary
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like there's a problem
 
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.510 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like there's a problem
with

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
how you guys do business
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
who notifies who and what have you so
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
now you're making it so in my opinion
 
00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:33.190 align:start position:0%
now you're making it so in my opinion
that

00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
and let me and tell me if i'm correct
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
that there could possibly be even a
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
longer 72 hours
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
did i ask the question
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure there was a it was
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh i think the concern is representative
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
i think the concern you're trying
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
raising is if a person is arrested
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
on parole
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
can that person still be held long in
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
the 72 hours absolutely that's it
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
because of someone because perhaps
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
even even by accident failed to provide
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
so the 72 hours would start as soon as
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
the probation parole officers notified
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned earlier if they were
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
arrested today
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
it would be on the superintendent of
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
that county jail to notify us and that's
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
when the clock would start that 72 hour
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
clock for us to get into the preliminary
 
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.870 align:start position:0%
clock for us to get into the preliminary
hearing

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
if the chairs may inquire with the
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
question what would happen in a
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason a
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
person they forgot to give notice
 
00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:53.829 align:start position:0%
person they forgot to give notice
i

00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
i guess my concern is if or even if they
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
intentionally didn't give notice
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
hold up to 72 hour clock and
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
going i understand there may be some
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
civil rights issues there but at the
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
same time in the short term
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen in that scenario
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
if once the 72 hour clock is expired
 
00:56:10.319 --> 00:56:11.030 align:start position:0%
if once the 72 hour clock is expired
then

00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:11.829 align:start position:0%
then
um

00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
they would be released from that county
 
00:56:14.079 --> 00:56:18.470 align:start position:0%
they would be released from that county
facility

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
if i can just ask a follow-up and thank
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question but my my
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
question is if someone never
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
provides a notice the 72-hour clock
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
would never start
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
so correct sir
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
so what would happen in a scenario and
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying this is happening but
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
let's just say a police officer decide
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
not to
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
transmit that notice
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
what what would be the result of that
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
if we were not notified that they were
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
um arrested or detained
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
that 72 hour clock would never start so
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
after 72 hours we would have to uh that
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused but yet i can read
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
and follow the right written word this
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
is all in regards to somebody who has
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
been previously arrested
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
how does this all fall into place with
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
somebody who's
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
being arrested who's never been arrested
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
before is not on probation is not a have
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
a parole officer
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have an impact on it sir
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
this is only for the folks
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
that are under on parole and they've
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
been arrested on a parole warrant
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative martin you recognized for
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
so in that case with a person who's
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
never been arrested within 72 hours
 
00:57:44.789 --> 00:57:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
no sir for any charge outside of the
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
parole violation i'm i'm not sure what
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
the timeline is on a regular charge this
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a parole violation thank
 
00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.789 align:start position:0%
pertaining to a parole violation thank
you

00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative pandolakis
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.309 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:58:02.309 --> 00:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
have they ever notified the parole
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
officers before
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
the superintendents
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am that's how it works currently
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
and as as i made mentioned in my written
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
statement there's just been times no
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
fault to the jails as far as malice or
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
trying to avoid notifying us
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
there's been delays
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
in notifying us at times
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that the county
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
facilities backed up or administrative
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
rules that they have
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
the clock starts a little longer once
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
we're notified but they do currently
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
notify us
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question i really have a very
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
when someone is arrested
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
and it is a pro-e how did the how is
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
they're arrested on that parole warrant
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
as an example if you were stopped on the
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
street and they ran your name it would
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
come back as a parole hit so the officer
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
would then arrest you on that parole
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
warrant and in that readout it would say
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
who the pro officer is and they should
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
follow representative board name so in
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
this case and so all perles are in a
 
00:59:34.390 --> 00:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
database so that when an officer arrest
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
someone their name would come up if they
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
were on parole yes sir thank you very
 
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.430 align:start position:0%
were on parole yes sir thank you very
much

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
i just i just have maybe you can clarify
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh something that you said for me
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
um you talked about a control center
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.799 --> 00:59:58.069 align:start position:0%
 
available

00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day seven days a week
 
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.589 align:start position:0%
24 hours a day seven days a week
um

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
and here it says so if you're notified
 
01:00:06.559 --> 01:00:07.829 align:start position:0%
and here it says so if you're notified
there

01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:09.190 align:start position:0%
there
um

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
that there that it would be 72 hours and
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
it also includes saturday sundays and
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
holidays so that 72 hours could be
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
longer when they're notified is that
 
01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:18.549 align:start position:0%
longer when they're notified is that
correct

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes sir yes that does not include
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative tessman
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
how many times does this happen i mean
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year 10 or 20 times a
 
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.309 align:start position:0%
once or twice a year 10 or 20 times a
year

01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
you know your your estimate of how many
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
times per year this happens
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you sir it's not often i couldn't
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
put a number on it i've been the
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
director of field services for a little
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
under three years now
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
it has not happened often but the few
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
times that it has happened that's when
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
would this proposed statute uh
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
apply to people who have been convicted
 
01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:14.309 align:start position:0%
apply to people who have been convicted
of

01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
or of uh of violent crimes uh only or
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
does this apply
 
01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
to non-violent offenses as well
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir it would be for any
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
violation that
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
that the parole had the warrant states
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
on it so it could be any violation not
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
representatives you recognize for a
 
01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.309 align:start position:0%
representatives you recognize for a
follow-up

01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
given your experience
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
my guess is you've had
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
you've had some
 
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
at least anecdotal experience with how
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
the current system is working
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
how long typically does it take
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know for this notification
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh to take place uh
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
currently without this bill
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question honestly i i
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a precise answer to that
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not on the street with the ppos but
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
i can definitely uh
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative museum recognized for a
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes would you agree that um
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's important to have an answer for
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
that question because uh that would be
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
the amount of time
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
that uh would get that could potentially
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
get added to the 72 hours
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
which means
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
we would be able to quantify
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of the additional amount of
 
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.910 align:start position:0%
the amount of the additional amount of
time

01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
somebody might be held in jail if
 
01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
there's a late notification
 
01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:42.870 align:start position:0%
there's a late notification
in

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
if i understood the question
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry could you repeat the question
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
i i'm the one who didn't get much sleep
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
so i'll try to i'll try to be a little
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
bit uh
 
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
bit uh
um

01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'll try to be a little bit clearer but
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
from from the sounds of it
 
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.150 align:start position:0%
from from the sounds of it
um

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is something that you have
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
experience with now
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
parole officers are no are
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
are notified when when possible um
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess what i was asking is based
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
on your your current experience and the
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
fact that we really don't have data for
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
this yet
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
i'm a little stuck trying to quantify
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know are we talking about maybe
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
82 hours for some people are we talking
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
about a hundred i'm just wondering with
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the clock not starting until the parole
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
officer is notified
 
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
officer is notified
um

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
whether we might have something like a
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
habeas corpus issue going on here thank
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
you sir
 
01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
you sir
the

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
it is not a common thing as i mentioned
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
earlier with the other question it's not
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
a common thing i don't know the exact
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
time frame that it takes to be notified
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
but i know it's not normally an issue
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're usually done in a timely manner
 
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.750 align:start position:0%
they're usually done in a timely manner
and

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to make sure that
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're notified in a timely manner and
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
then the clock could stop start excuse
 
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.789 align:start position:0%
then the clock could stop start excuse
me

01:04:08.789 --> 01:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative welch
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
uh

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
 
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.710 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that
the

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
facility at the men's prison
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's available 24 7.
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
once that phone call from the
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
correctional facility goes in doesn't
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
that start it isn't that the same as
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
notifying the probation officer yes sir
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
when they're when they when the
 
01:04:38.549 --> 01:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
individual is arrested it states right
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
on the paperwork to notify the probation
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
parole officer or off hours that contact
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
prison control
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for taking the question so
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
forgive me if this was addressed or if
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
this is obvious but
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
what happens to the individual are they
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
picked up and brought back to prison
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
like what is the process that's
 
01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:03.109 align:start position:0%
like what is the process that's
triggered

01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
triggered
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
from this notification working as it's
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
intended and and also what happens if
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
the person is then released can they
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
just be picked up again can you answer
 
01:05:14.549 --> 01:05:14.559 align:start position:0%
those in one fell swoop please
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
they with it within that 72 hours they
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
have to be presented in front of a judge
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
unless they waive a hearing so
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
once they're notified they have 72 hours
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
to actually have that preliminary
 
01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.950 align:start position:0%
to actually have that preliminary
hearing

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
a majority of the time they usually
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
waive that preliminary hearing
 
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.990 align:start position:0%
waive that preliminary hearing
um

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what we're looking to
 
01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:39.670 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what we're looking to
accomplish

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony of the
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
chairman choir for question and thank
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
we hear that term 72 hours comes up
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
it came up in almost every question
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
my question is is when someone is
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
taken into custody whether they're a
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
parolee or it's for a probation
 
01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.430 align:start position:0%
parolee or it's for a probation
violation

01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
approximately how long is it that person
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
actually in custody for
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
close to the 72 hours i'm not talking
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
about weekends and holidays i get that's
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
that's still an issue from the time
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're notified if i understand it yes
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think it was similar
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact number of or how
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's usually not an issue
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
where it's gone
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
beyond the 72 hours
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's become a problem for us when we're
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
notified late in that 72-hour clock
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
that we then have to struggle to try and
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
and if i mask involve upon being
 
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.230 align:start position:0%
and if i mask involve upon being
notified

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
notified
 
01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.190 align:start position:0%
notified
what

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
what's approximately how much time would
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
it take to have someone in custody
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
brought for a hearing
 
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
i understand sorry sir
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
once we're notified we do it almost
 
01:06:55.119 --> 01:06:58.309 align:start position:0%
once we're notified we do it almost
immediately

01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i i have
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
a question about you mentioned uh
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
arrested on a parole
 
01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.510 align:start position:0%
arrested on a parole
parole

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
parole
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
or probation warrant or maybe that not
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
too maybe just you said parole warrant
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'd like to hear more about what
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
exactly that is and i'll just give an
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
example that you might want to
 
01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
example that you might want to
differentiate

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
is there a difference between being
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
arrested on a parole warrant and a
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
parolee being arrested for dwi for
 
01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.470 align:start position:0%
parolee being arrested for dwi for
example

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes yes sir
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
so once you're placed on parole
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
you have to live within certain
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
guidelines and restrictions if you
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
violate any of those restrictions then
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
the parole officer would then
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
write for a warrant to be signed by the
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
parole board
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
if someone was out on parole and got
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
arrested for some other charge say dwi
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
that would be a separate charge
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
we would then probably move to make a
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
violation and have a pro warrant issued
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
represent newman recognized for a
 
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.589 align:start position:0%
represent newman recognized for a
follow-up

01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
so in relation to your answer
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
someone who is on parole or probation
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
gets a dwi that they would be subject to
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
the laws that is
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
that applied to someone who has just
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
been arrested for that
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
the witness for his testimony thank you
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public who
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
are present who wish to testify that
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
have not testified already please raise
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none at this time we will now
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:04.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now call the order the
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice and public safety
 
01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice and public safety
committee

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
this time when i open the public hearing
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
on senate bill
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
293 establishing a committee to clarify
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%

01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the violation of privacy
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the committee now calls senator
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
james gray
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is james
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
gray i am the senator representing
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
district six
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
which starts in rochester goes up route
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
11 to alton barnstead and gilmanton
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
has its
 
01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.550 align:start position:0%
has its
origin

01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
origin
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
many years ago and we haven't been able
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
to to get it through covet has caused a
 
01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:23.110 align:start position:0%
to to get it through covet has caused a
problem

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh but imagine that you are an
 
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.510 align:start position:0%
uh but imagine that you are an
individual

01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.790 align:start position:0%
individual
and

01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
somebody records your voice
 
01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.910 align:start position:0%
somebody records your voice
unintentionally

01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
unintentionally
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
now suppose that you are an individual
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
and somebody records you
 
01:27:45.669 --> 01:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
with video and no voice
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
in some state of undress is that a
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or a felony
 
01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
and what you'll find out
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
the first one's a felony and the second
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
one is a misdemeanor
 
01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.830 align:start position:0%
one is a misdemeanor
that's

01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
we've had people testify in private pre
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
prior years that
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
gee this is going to
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
take away people's rights
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have some
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
progressive justice
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
we've had people
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
testify that gee we need more time to
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
study this whole issue
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
we've had lots of different testimony so
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
the good senate committee took uh
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
what my suggestion was and
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh progressive justice
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
and turned it into the bill that you see
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
in front of you now
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
i want to tell you that in
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
stratford county
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
one of the individuals that caused this
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
invaded a home
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
got into bed with an individual
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
and why
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
because we didn't do a good job
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
of having the laws protect that
 
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.470 align:start position:0%
of having the laws protect that
individual

01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to go
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
so are you asking essentially the
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the lawmakers to go back and on a
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
and say this goes with that this goes
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
with this
uh

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah or is that something that you know
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney general or
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
could go through and say you know this
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
goes with that i mean uh is it we have a
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion of where what
 
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.510 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion of where what
we're

01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
trying people
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
or just this is what we think i guess
 
01:29:56.239 --> 01:29:57.430 align:start position:0%
or just this is what we think i guess
i'm

01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
and we've got an attorney general and a
 
01:29:59.040 --> 01:29:59.910 align:start position:0%
and we've got an attorney general and a
whole

01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
bunch of really smartest lawyers in the
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
world who can figure this
 
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
out the as far as i know the law is very
 
01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
out the as far as i know the law is very
clear

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
in both of the cases that i
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
set before you
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
the senate committee which
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
since the senate position is the
 
01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.390 align:start position:0%
since the senate position is the
position

01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
that i am here to support
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
wanted a study committee
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
certainly i want you to know that there
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
was an opportunity
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
to do something with the law itself
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
and not the study committee but again
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
right now i'm
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to support the senate
 
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.310 align:start position:0%
going to support the senate
and

01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
that if we have a study committee and
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
the committee comes forth that will be
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
another reason why
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh that we as legislators should
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
make whatever change the study committee
 
01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:56.870 align:start position:0%
make whatever change the study committee
says

01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for you
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
know taking my question uh i'm looking
 
01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.830 align:start position:0%
know taking my question uh i'm looking
at

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:31:06.790 --> 01:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
644 colon 9 right now
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
i see where the class a misdemeanor is
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
where is the class
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
where's the felony charge
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't bring the copies of the statute
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh but that's what i was informed by
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
several people including the chief of
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
oh could i have a follow-up
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative burt you recognize for a
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you oh
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
so are you
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
hoping that the committee you know the
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
study committee will come out with a
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
felony charge for these or are you
 
01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.910 align:start position:0%
felony charge for these or are you
looking

01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
just to study to see where it should be
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
a person who re records a video of you
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
in a state of undress
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh is more severe than
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh recording your voice without your
 
01:32:03.679 --> 01:32:04.790 align:start position:0%
uh recording your voice without your
permission

01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
permission
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh with no other
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
and that that penalty should be equal to
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
or greater than
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
the recording of your voice
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
senator is excused
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
um good morning mr chair and members of
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is pamela keilig
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i am the public policy specialist at
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire coalition against
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
domestic and sexual violence um the
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
coalition is the umbrella organization
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
for our 12 community-based crisis
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
centers that serve
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
about 15 000 survivors of domestic and
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
sexual violence through our free and
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
confidential services each year
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
we're here to speak in support of sb 293
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
which would establish a study committee
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
to review and clarify
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's violation of privacy
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
statute as you heard
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
from the senator rsa 644-9
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that changes to the statute
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
need to be made to ensure that it is
 
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
adequately protects individuals against
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
sexual exploitation and abuse
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we think that this could be the
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate vehicle to explore
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know what those changes could be
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
and especially make it consistent with
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
other interrelating statutes violations
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
of privacy can be co-occurring with acts
 
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
of stalking sexual assault domestic
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
violence and child exploitation and can
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
have extreme emotional and psychological
 
01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
impacts on a victim moreover violations
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
of privacy are often indicators of
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
lethal intent and even escalating
 
01:33:51.199 --> 01:33:52.229 align:start position:0%
lethal intent and even escalating
violence

01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:52.239 align:start position:0%
violence
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
so they should be seen as serious crimes
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
and co-occurring crimes
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
studying rsa 6449 would help ensure that
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
the statute is updated and that any
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
future legislation would align with
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
those interrelating statutes that i
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
briefly mentioned some of those are rsa

01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
all of those statutes if one is changed
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
could have unintended consequences on
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
another statute if the whole picture
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
isn't viewed so we really ask that the
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
study commission or we believe that the
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
study committee is really important
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
because it will give us the opportunity
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
to really interrogate those statutes and
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
and create thoughtful legislation
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
and so i think with that i just asked
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
the committee to please consider
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and making sure
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
that we respond appropriately to these
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
crimes and that the appropriate changes
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
are made in the future thank you and i
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.629 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
testimony

01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
how many um so looking at the 649
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
644.9 yep uh
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
how many cases have been
 
01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:20.550 align:start position:0%
how many cases have been
prosecuted

01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
each year and how many have been found
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
guilty of this this misdemeanor crime
 
01:35:27.990 --> 01:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
that possibly could grow to a felony
 
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.189 align:start position:0%
that possibly could grow to a felony
charge

01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah no thank you so much for your
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
question representative i don't have the
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
statistics offhand um but i'd be happy
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
to look into that for you i do know that
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
between the statutes that i listed and
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and members of law
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement often have to be creative in
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
terms of applying it because
 
01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.229 align:start position:0%
terms of applying it because
there's

01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
because of the way they speak to each
 
01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.709 align:start position:0%
because of the way they speak to each
other

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i think there's ways that we can
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
clarify what's in the statute to make
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure that it's very clear what the
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
intent is and what those what a
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy actually means and
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll try to peek around
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative bordenay's head here uh
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
so uh i can see you are there specific
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
gaps uh in the statute
 
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.109 align:start position:0%
gaps uh in the statute
uh

01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
that uh that you're looking to address
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
or that you would like the committee to
 
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
or that you would like the committee to
address

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a specific proposal in
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
mind um i do know that in the past three
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
legislative sessions um bills have been
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
introduced to explore
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know what happens if someone
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
repeatedly violates these things like
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
three or more times and it's always a
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level we're not saying that
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily the proposal but
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's something that has been looked at
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
but i think the question here is just
 
01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
what are these crimes and and how
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
invasive they are and how um they are
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
often indicative of further violence um
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
and are is the statute really doing uh
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
what it needs to do in response to those
 
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.390 align:start position:0%
what it needs to do in response to those
crimes

01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
um under section 6449
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
a um and then
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
in section two c it says
 
01:37:31.030 --> 01:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
about a person with like un unsolicited
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
images under c
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
it says that the per like knows or
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
should have known that the person in the
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
image has not consented to
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
his is not basically he's not consented
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
to it so would that
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
already not
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
not be in the law or am i
 
01:37:49.850 --> 01:37:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah as i was reading maybe i'm
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding it but would that not
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
already is that not already covered
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
under the under the law under that
 
01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:06.629 align:start position:0%
under the under the law under that
section

01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
sorry i missed it okay so section one um
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh section 644 nine
 
01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then it is under section two
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
and then it's a one two
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
and then b's oh my god c it's really
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.189 --> 01:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
the copy i have doesn't align with that
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
just to clarify i think you're you're
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
reading from 644
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
colon9-a where this study committee
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
would only apply to 644 colon 9. okay
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
but that's already that's what i'm
 
01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:50.470 align:start position:0%
but that's already that's what i'm
saying

01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
this section is what what the study
 
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
commission would be yeah it's already a
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
i haven't read that far yet
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
i did
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
partially i think um i think this is why
 
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
we need to have these conversations and
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
why it's worth having a study committee
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
what i've noticed
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
in you know my two years here serving in
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
my role is that oftentimes
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment or an amendment to a
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
statute will come in but it will not
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
have looked at the larger picture um and
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we have sort of a patchwork of um
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
a statute here that has like oh you know
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
this needs to be covered under that but
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
then maybe it was already partially
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
covered under another one uh for example
 
01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.590 align:start position:0%
covered under another one uh for example
um

01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
you this committee
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
passed or
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
voted to pass
 
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
a bill on unsolicited intimate images
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
and a previous iteration of that
 
01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.470 align:start position:0%
and a previous iteration of that
legislation

01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
actually had been placed in rsa 649
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
644 9 i believe
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
recent bill that passed this committee
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
was actually put into 64 45 1 which is
 
01:40:07.669 --> 01:40:07.679 align:start position:0%
the lewdness and indecent exposure
 
01:40:07.679 --> 01:40:08.390 align:start position:0%
the lewdness and indecent exposure
because

01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
there was discussion around maybe that
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
was the most appropriate place and so i
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
think there has been a bit of confus or
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say confusion but i
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
think a conversation is warranted to
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that when we update these
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
statutes the intent is very clear and
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
that we aren't um
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
confusing other statutes or
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
creating unintended consequences so that
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
they everything speaks really nicely in
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
harmony with each other
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer though i want to
 
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.950 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer though i want to
clarify

01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
clarify
so

01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
in your testimony so far and i might not
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
fair to uh
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
say that you you're looking at
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 645 you mentioned 645
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
9 you mentioned
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
all these numbers
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
of different bills
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.229 --> 01:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
so would it be fair to say that that
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
you're looking at somebody to take a
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
look a big picture look at all of those
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
bills that deal with privacies including
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
the definitions of the penalties and all
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
of those kind of things
 
01:41:22.239 --> 01:41:24.070 align:start position:0%
of those kind of things
to

01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
make a better set of laws that that
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
address privacy
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think
 
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
sp 293 is that vehicle to start looking
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
at this particular statute rsa 6449
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
violations of privacy
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
but i guess our
 
01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:39.990 align:start position:0%
but i guess our
my

01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
point is just that
 
01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:43.270 align:start position:0%
point is just that
because

01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to recognize that this
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
statute would have
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
impacts on others under other related
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
statutes so that's why i think it's
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
important to study this so that we
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
like are looking at the full picture
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognize for
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up could i make a question to the
 
01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.350 align:start position:0%
follow-up could i make a question to the
chair

01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
the parliamentary inquiry you recognize
 
01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.750 align:start position:0%
the parliamentary inquiry you recognize
um

01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
my reading of this bill
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
and a study committee says that the
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
report has to be made by november 1st so
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
what happens you can't go over
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
the election
 
01:42:25.669 --> 01:42:25.679 align:start position:0%
but there are some study committees that
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
that go on
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
indefinitely and i don't know if that's
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
a different kind of study committee but
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
could you just comment on
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
on the problem with the date and the
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
difference between study committees if
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
it depends on what what the proposed
 
01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.350 align:start position:0%
it depends on what what the proposed
bill

01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
says now you can have this has a
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
deadline of when it has to be
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
a final report needs to be made
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
and then upon the final report being
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
made that that's when it's concluded
 
01:42:57.679 --> 01:42:58.950 align:start position:0%
made that that's when it's concluded
now

01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:42:58.960 --> 01:42:59.750 align:start position:0%
now
if

01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
some some
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
study committees or commissions they can
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
go on
 
01:43:03.679 --> 01:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
go on
indefinitely

01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
indefinitely
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
the downside to that is that those
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees are kind of
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
just they're just out there they're open
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're not active
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
the idea is
 
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:16.639 align:start position:0%
there's a deadline when they want this
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
to be submitted by now
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
i understand there's a filing period
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
i know it's it's different depending on
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
which body you're in but for
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
members of the house my understanding is
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
if you're already a member of the house
 
01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
right now there's some filing period
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
that can occur in september
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
obviously i presume this report wouldn't
 
01:43:36.950 --> 01:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
be done by then but
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
there's also a second filing period i
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't remember the exact dates but it's
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
in december
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
so there would be time to
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
um review that whatever the study
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee's report is
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up yes
 
01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:56.550 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up yes
so

01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
the writers of this bill could they have
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
by changing the date
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
extended into the next session
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
they could it's whatever the intent is
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the drafter they they can put they
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
can put you know 20 25. you know
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
november 1st 2025 the problem with that
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
is that without a final report any
 
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
benefits of that
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
study the some of the legislators that
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
next term
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
would not have the benefit of whatever
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
whatever that committee learned or
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
gathered so the idea is this is
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
something that i believe
 
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:33.109 align:start position:0%
something that i believe
needs

01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and the goal would be to
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
address it
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
in the first year of next term is my
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
intent of that short deadline
 
01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
of my interpretation of that should i
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
return to my follow-up with the witness
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
so

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:49.830 --> 01:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
given the discussion we just had
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know how big or little you think
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
the time period would be to accomplish
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
whatever your goals are with a study
 
01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.669 align:start position:0%
whatever your goals are with a study
committee

01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
um do you do you have any comments about
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
the discussion we just had about the
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
date of november of november the first
 
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
yeah um i would um thank you so much for
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
your question i would definitely leave
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
that up to you all um in the legislature
 
01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of that because i believe a
 
01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
study committee only is made up of
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
legislators and isn't a broader
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
commission um so
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
i would you know but we're happy to be a
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
resource um in answering any questions
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
moving forward if you do move forward
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
with the study committee thank you very
 
01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:34.229 align:start position:0%
with the study committee thank you very
much

01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
i am gathering from
 
01:45:45.669 --> 01:45:45.679 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation which is
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
asking for a study committee
 
01:45:48.239 --> 01:45:49.430 align:start position:0%
asking for a study committee
that

01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're not ready for prime time why is
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
this not being made into a law not a
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much for your question
 
01:45:57.280 --> 01:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much for your question
representative

01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
this um this bill was amended in the
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
senate to become a study committee
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
because of several pieces of legislation
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
that were introduced in 2022 to uh to
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
amend rsa 6449 and so rather than
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking on both of those pieces of
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislation they converted this bill
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
into a study committee because of um the
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
competing interest to make changes and
 
01:46:25.189 --> 01:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make those changes
 
01:46:25.199 --> 01:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make those changes
thoughtfully

01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding thank you very
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised i want to thank the
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
witness for for her testimony thank you
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
are there any members of the public who
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
are present who wish to testify that
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
have not testified already
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now close the public
 
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.109 align:start position:0%
this time we'll now close the public
hearing

01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
at this time the committee will be in
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
recess to
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
this time the committee will come to
 
02:15:21.119 --> 02:15:25.350 align:start position:0%
this time the committee will come to
order

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
we will now open the public hearing
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 393 relative to the use
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
of restraints on pregnant women in the
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
custody of a state or county
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
the committee calls senator whitley
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and good
 
02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:46.960 align:start position:0%

whitley and i'm honored to serve new
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire senate district 15 which
 
02:15:56.069 --> 02:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
includes the wonderful
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
communities of concord henneker
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
as a mother i'm honored to bring forth
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
today senate bill 393 which limits the
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
types of restraints used on pregnant
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated in new
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire jails and prisons
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
so as many folks may know shackling
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
pregnant women poses serious health
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
risks to both mom and to baby
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
you may have received testimony from
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
medical experts that say shackling poses
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
safety risks that include the potential
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
for injury or placental abruption caused
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
by falls delayed progress of labor
 
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
caused by impaired mobility and delayed
 
02:16:38.790 --> 02:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
receipt of emergency care when
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
corrections officers must remove
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
shackles to allow for assessment or
 
02:16:42.319 --> 02:16:43.589 align:start position:0%
shackles to allow for assessment or
intervention

02:16:43.589 --> 02:16:43.599 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
it can also interfere with the ability
 
02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
of people postpartum to safely handle
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
feed and bond with a newborn which as a
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
mom is one of the most precious points
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
of a baby's life
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
furthermore restraining women in
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
transport to prenatal care and during
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
delivery and labor can obstruct
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
necessary medical care and during labor
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
lead to extreme physical pain and
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
complications because of the mother's
 
02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
inability to move freely
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
according to a 2017 report from the
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
american psychological association
 
02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and i will point out that anyone who has
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
given birth knows that a woman's ability
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
to harm others or flee during labor
 
02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
is severely limited right uh both
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know it during labor during delivery
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
and of course postpartum uh is is a very
 
02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
vulnerable time for women and you don't
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
have much control
 
02:17:39.110 --> 02:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
women subjected to restraint during
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
childbirth birth also report severe
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
mental distress depression anguish and
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
trauma this is also from the 2017 apa
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
report that i mentioned previously
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
shackling during or immediately
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
following childbirth can cause
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
or exacerbate pregnancy-related mental
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
health concerns including depression and
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder i think
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's important to point out that this
 
02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee may be well aware that women
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated tend to on average
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
have suffered many many more childhood
 
02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.270 align:start position:0%
have suffered many many more childhood
traumas

02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
traumas
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
being shackled can increase
 
02:18:14.870 --> 02:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic symptoms caused by prior
 
02:18:17.190 --> 02:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
experiences of trauma and can of course
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
always also be re-traumatizing
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
national correctional and medical
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
associations oppose the shackling of
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
pregnant women because in most cases
 
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary and of course dangerous
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
to the health of the mom and the baby
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
the nation's leading experts in maternal
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
fetal and child health care the american
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
congress of uh obstetrics
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
obstetricians and gynecologists have
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
clearly stated their opposition to the
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
practice of shackling according to that
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
association acog shackling interferes
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
with the ability of physicians to safely
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
practice medicine
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
and is demeaning and unnecessary
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
so i i wanted to point your attention to
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
um two things
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that came over from the
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
senate was the result of
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
extensive cooperation
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
and collaboration between advocacy
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
organizations myself
 
02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
organizations myself
and

02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
from you know a lot of input from the
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
department of corrections and we heard
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
some concerns from counties so the
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
amended version did take into account a
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
lot of those concerns but i will say the
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration has continued so in front
 
02:19:28.629 --> 02:19:28.639 align:start position:0%
of you you have
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
i hope you have amendment one three four
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
four everyone have that great so that is
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
again the result of continued
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
collaboration between all parties and um
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from the folks behind me
 
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
that can give you some more detail about
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
why they felt it was necessary to make
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
these changes but i do feel i'm
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
incredibly grateful for all the
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
advocates for the medical professionals
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
that worked incredibly hard to get this
 
02:19:59.349 --> 02:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
bill where it is and to the department
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
of corrections for their work i i feel
 
02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:02.790 align:start position:0%
of corrections for their work i i feel
that

02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:04.870 --> 02:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
this collaborative collaboration has
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
resulted in a bill that both protects
 
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
the safety of well-being of our moms and
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
babies but also of course
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
public safety and the safety of our
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
correctional officers it's a delicate
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
balance and i believe that this
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendment really strikes that delicate
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
balance so thank you for your
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
consideration i'm happy to take any
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
questions but i think the more technical
 
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
questions are better left for the people
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative pandalagas
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
know if the amendment replaces the whole
 
02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:37.270 align:start position:0%
know if the amendment replaces the whole
bill

02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:20:39.910 --> 02:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
let's see um it replaces amend the bill
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
by replacing sections one and two
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um for taking my question and
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
for bringing us the spill uh was there a
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you could tell me was there a an
 
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
incident or an impetus for this bill uh
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
coming from that that you brought at the
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
visioning product thank you for that
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
question so it was actually brought to
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
me by a number of advocates including
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
acog um new hampshire has a very robust
 
02:21:07.439 --> 02:21:08.790 align:start position:0%
acog um new hampshire has a very robust
um

02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
num a very robust society the acog those
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
are the obstetricians and the
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%
gynecologists who you know in new
 
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire in fact you know it's a it's a
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
field that's really fraught right now
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
because there's not a lot of them and
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it's an area that in new
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're really trying to make
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
sure we get new ob gyns to new hampshire
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
but they raised the issue with me it was
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
also raised separately from advocates so
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's linked to a
 
02:21:34.469 --> 02:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
particular incident but it's certainly
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
one that many folks have been thinking
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
long and hard about it
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
because it's such an important issue for
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair haven't there been
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
incidents nationally where
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
pregnant women in uh jail or prison have
 
02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:57.270 align:start position:0%
pregnant women in uh jail or prison have
faced

02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
faced
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
safety concerns
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
because of um
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
these sorts of restraints thank you for
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
the question yes and acog actually does
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%

expose your hands behind the back
uh

02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know you can sort of think about you
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
know when a woman
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
is pregnant their belly is expanding
 
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
right um
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
and so i think you know there are some
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
experts that can speak to that more in
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
particular why that was put into the
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill but yeah it's a medical indication
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
the majority of the bill was written
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know uh we started with what was you
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
know most appropriately medically and
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
then we you know the next phase of the
 
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
work was really to look about how to you
 
02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
know balance what's necessary for mom
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
and baby and what's necessary for public
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
safety so there is a very delicate
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
balance thanks for that question
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
another reason for uh handcuffing women
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the front would might that be
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
so the woman could protect herself in
 
02:23:35.270 --> 02:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
the event of a fall
 
02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.630 align:start position:0%
the event of a fall
correct

02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's seeing no hands raised i'm going to
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank thank you senator for your
 
02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:45.750 align:start position:0%
thank thank you senator for your
testimony

02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
hello and good morning
 
02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
i am christy and i am a resident of new
 
02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i also bring with me the
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
direct lived experience as a formerly
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated woman so i have lived
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
handcuffed and shackled at various times
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
during my incarceration i can tell you
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's extremely uncomfortable has left
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
bruises and has been painful
 
02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
i support this bill because i have lived
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
with pregnant women who were in
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
preparation to give birth
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
during their their time at the prison
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm also a mother of three children and
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
i have experienced postpartum depression
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
with each of those three children
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
mothers should have the opportunity to
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
birth their children free of shackles
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
giving birth is an all-encompassing
 
02:24:43.349 --> 02:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
endeavor which requires focus
 
02:24:46.550 --> 02:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to move if needed and
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
most importantly the ability to hold
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
your baby for the first time a baby who
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
have you have carried inside of you for
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
nine months and this should be done so
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
without any added stress or anxiety
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
shackling a human being during birth or
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
in preparation for is not only excessive
 
02:25:07.590 --> 02:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
it is cruel and unusual punishment for
 
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
the mother and the baby the pregnant
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
mothers who i met in prison were riddled
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
with fear and anxiety as they prepared
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
for this about the confinement and about
 
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
the imminent separation that they were
 
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
going to have from their baby
 
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
imagine these emotions passing through
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
the mother to their baby as they
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
prepared for birth
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
upon returning to prison after giving
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
birth these women oftentimes would
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
seclude themselves in their cells for
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
days or weeks sometimes curled in the
 
02:25:38.710 --> 02:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
fetal position crying
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
obviously traumatized and devastated
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
from the overall experience
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
bringing life into this world is
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary and each one of us in this
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
room were birthed from a mother and
 
02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:51.429 align:start position:0%
room were birthed from a mother and
impacted

02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
from the moment we took our first breath
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
let us not
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
disturb this miracle with shackles thank
 
02:25:58.399 --> 02:26:03.990 align:start position:0%
disturb this miracle with shackles thank
you

02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee my
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
name is joseph lascaz
 
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
i will be representing the american
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
civil liberties union of new hampshire
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
in support of this legislation
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
the first thing that i just wanted to do
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh i just wanted to work my way
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
backwards actually and start answering a
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
couple questions that had been um
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
proposed and then work into it um
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative abbott talked about uh
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
the study of the front to back and
 
02:26:48.309 --> 02:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the medical providers that
 
02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
we worked with when um
 
02:26:53.349 --> 02:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
researching this uh were are not able to
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
be here today because they are
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
taking care of community members at
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
various hospitals across the state but
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
what i did learn from them is that the
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
shackling it does present an issue
 
02:27:05.110 --> 02:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
specifically with the increased use of
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
blood clots
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
for pregnant women
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the other issue happened to be with
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that the center of gravity is
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
actually changed
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
when an individual is pregnant so having
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
the front cuffs would be able to provide
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount of protection
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
for the resident when being transported
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
the medical community did want to make
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
sure that they that it was on record
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
that they they personally believe that
 
02:27:35.270 --> 02:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be any restraints um at
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
any point in time for
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh pregnant um residents and again if
 
02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
they were able to be here today they
 
02:27:44.710 --> 02:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
would um they would speak as to the
 
02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
medical reasons why
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
with that being said this is this
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is something that
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
we can all support and
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
and go through with because it does
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
bring safety it balances safety of
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
the correctional institutions when
 
02:28:02.710 --> 02:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
dealing with residents during transport
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
but it also
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
brings a medical benefit where it
 
02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
decreases the use of blood clots it
 
02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:08.630 align:start position:0%
decreases the use of blood clots it
allows

02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
allows
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
a resident to be able to safely move
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
around and as the humane aspect to it
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
where during delivery childbirth
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
and postpartum restraints wouldn't be
 
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.550 align:start position:0%
and postpartum restraints wouldn't be
used

02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
one thing that i do want to say that one
 
02:28:24.150 --> 02:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
beneficial um
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
change to
 
02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
the current
 
02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
the current
law

02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
that i can speak to
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
personally is the fact that
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
security personnel are making medical
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
calls and this happened to me in 2012 i
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
had a torn rotator cuff and a dislocated
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
a visibly dislocated shoulder and a
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
security personnel decided to make a
 
02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
security personnel decided to make a
medical

02:28:47.830 --> 02:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
call that i should be restrained with
 
02:28:52.389 --> 02:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
belly cuffs and my and behind my back
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
with that and that resulted in further
 
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
damage that had to be resolved at cmc
 
02:28:59.590 --> 02:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
hospital so this takes care of those
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
type of situations by placing that call
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
back in the medical provider's hands and
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
i do think that this is something that
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
will move our state forward in equitable
 
02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:08.790 align:start position:0%
will move our state forward in equitable
practices

02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
practices
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
so with that i would conclude my
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
testimony i'm happy to take any
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i don't know if
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to answer this and maybe
 
02:29:23.670 --> 02:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
someone else could after you
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea of how many
 
02:29:26.399 --> 02:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea of how many
women

02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
women
 
02:29:30.710 --> 02:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
on average in a year are pregnant and
 
02:29:33.429 --> 02:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
giving birth while incarcerated
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire in new hampshire
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
specifically that
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire for the county jails
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
and for the prison system combined the
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
number uh is is not um near the national
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
average but what i can say um
 
02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:50.150 align:start position:0%
average but what i can say um
from

02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
there is the number
 
02:29:55.110 --> 02:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's since 1970 the number uh the number
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
has grown by seven fold um
 
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
that is what uh has that research has
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
come back from the medical providers um
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
that that are dealing with them in the
 
02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:08.710 align:start position:0%
that that are dealing with them in the
community

02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
02:30:13.190 --> 02:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question um
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
can you just walk us through quickly um
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i i know that this is not
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
an uncommon situation in our state
 
02:30:21.439 --> 02:30:22.389 align:start position:0%
an uncommon situation in our state
prison

02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
prison
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
or our county jails
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
um but i'm curious what the current
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedure is and
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
whether it differs from county to county
 
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:32.070 align:start position:0%
whether it differs from county to county
and

02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
or if it's consistent across the state
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
prison system
 
02:30:37.590 --> 02:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative muse
 
02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
for that question uh it actually differs
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
and that is that is a problem that and
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
this will bring uniformity
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
several years ago we worked with the
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
department of corrections on on their
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
internal policy uh related to restraints
 
02:30:54.389 --> 02:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
in incarcerated
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
pregnant residents
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they they had adopted um the best
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
practices at the time and since then we
 
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
have continued to work on on more
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
equitable equitable approaches and
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
bringing the medical community providers
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
that work in our state with these
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
residents bringing them into the
 
02:31:14.710 --> 02:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
conversation has really highlighted some
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
ways that we can continue to improve
 
02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:18.469 align:start position:0%
ways that we can continue to improve
this

02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
the process right now
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
and the way that it goes is
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
it it varies from from
 
02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
county facility to county facility and
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
there are some that are that are that
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
are worse than others um specifically uh
 
02:31:34.230 --> 02:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
valley street is is a county facility
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
where that
 
02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
the application of this law would have
 
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest impacts to the
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
incarcerated residents there
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
for the way that
 
02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
their transportation is done
 
02:31:47.910 --> 02:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
so that yes there is significant changes
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands right i want to thank

the committee now calls nikki plant new

02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%

corrections and the commissioner would
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
have loved to be here today but she had
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%

begin
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the proposed amendment presented
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
this morning by senator whitley
 
02:32:49.510 --> 02:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
all of the written testimony that was
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
submitted prior to and any of the
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
concerns on the behalf of the department
 
02:32:55.110 --> 02:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
of corrections have now been addressed
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
with the new proposal
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
with that said
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire department of
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
corrections is now in full support of
 
02:33:05.270 --> 02:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
the new amendment to this legislation
 
02:33:07.349 --> 02:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
as it balances the dignity of the
 
02:33:13.190 --> 02:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
and to representative schultz's question
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we do have data only for the state
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
prisons on the back of that sheet
 
02:33:21.750 --> 02:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
current through today
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to provide
 
02:33:29.110 --> 02:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
and if the chair may inquire of a
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
question this is either one
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
either witness may answer this i
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
understand that initially you may have
 
02:33:36.870 --> 02:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
been in opposition to this but now in
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
support can you explain what policy
 
02:33:41.590 --> 02:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
changed in the proposed amendment that
 
02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.510 align:start position:0%
changed in the proposed amendment that
would

02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
cause that change in consideration
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
um the concerns presented by the
 
02:33:49.590 --> 02:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
department of corrections were
 
02:33:52.469 --> 02:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
in section two discussed transports
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
first second and third trimester as
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
front handcuff only
 
02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
and if you went to the previous version
 
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
section three and section four
 
02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
further described
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
that medical appointments for medicals
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
and transportation to courts required
 
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely no restraints
 
02:34:13.670 --> 02:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
so it was a conflict
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
and some confusion regarding the
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
statement in section two and that was
 
02:34:21.750 --> 02:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair thanks for taking the
 
02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:27.910 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for taking the
question

02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:34:30.790 --> 02:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
could the department implement this
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
all the measures spelled out in this
 
02:34:32.319 --> 02:34:33.270 align:start position:0%
all the measures spelled out in this
bill

02:34:33.270 --> 02:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
sir the actual bill um is in line with
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
departmental policies as we exist and
 
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've been running for years
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay so you're already doing everything
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
that's clear that's in that is correct
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative rory

thank you
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
um a follow-up of my colleagues question
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
a new commissioner though could change
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct sir i think i would i
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
i see no hands right
 
02:35:17.429 --> 02:35:17.439 align:start position:0%

02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question as it stands now
 
02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
and on average how many pregnant women
 
02:35:28.389 --> 02:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
are in your facility
 
02:35:31.349 --> 02:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
so today i have zero sir
 
02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
with the fyb 22 in this past budget
 
02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:35.910 align:start position:0%
with the fyb 22 in this past budget
cycle

02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
we had two one was paroled out and one
 
02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:39.510 align:start position:0%
we had two one was paroled out and one
did

02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
deliver while in custody
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
02:35:49.670 --> 02:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
so after um
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
after she delivers
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
so that is for the duration of their
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
hospital stay
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
and so it's up to the hospital uh once
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
the resident is released from the
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
hospital she will return to the state
 
02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:03.830 align:start position:0%
hospital she will return to the state
prison

02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
prison
 
02:36:06.150 --> 02:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
and arrangements will be made prior to
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
through the hospital of where the baby
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
would go
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative roy so generally speaking
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
one to two days would that be fair
 
02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
without complications probably um
 
02:36:20.550 --> 02:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
in addition the department offers
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
generally residents get two visits a
 
02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:23.429 align:start position:0%
generally residents get two visits a
week

02:36:23.429 --> 02:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
with an infant for the first i believe
 
02:36:27.190 --> 02:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's at least eight months they get two
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
additional so they get four
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
opportunities to visit per week last
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
question please
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
um and just one more follow-up is there
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
a program in place for for women to be
 
02:36:38.630 --> 02:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
able to deliver breast milk should they
 
02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
choose to breastfeed to their infant or
 
02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:42.309 align:start position:0%
choose to breastfeed to their infant or
no

02:36:42.309 --> 02:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:36:44.309 --> 02:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
so it has been done i would not say that
 
02:36:46.230 --> 02:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
there's a program in place
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
it has been done so if there is a need
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
or if it's detrimental to the child in
 
02:36:51.750 --> 02:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
the hospital deems that it is necessary
 
02:36:53.429 --> 02:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
we make arrangements through our medical
 
02:36:55.670 --> 02:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
staff to have that facilitated and
 
02:36:58.389 --> 02:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
dropped off to the hospital themselves
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:37:06.309 --> 02:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
may i provide the witness with the
 
02:37:10.309 --> 02:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
the letter from the department of
 
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
corrections that we just passed out if
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
you don't have a copy of it you have it
 
02:37:13.439 --> 02:37:14.469 align:start position:0%
you don't have a copy of it you have it
yes

02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i have a question about i may
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
have now proceeded with my question
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh as i look at page one of the letter
 
02:37:26.389 --> 02:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
um in the
 
02:37:28.389 --> 02:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
the paragraph just above the last
 
02:37:31.270 --> 02:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph or the the two words it says
 
02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation has written
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
does not align
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
with the current breast practices and
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
may impede the department's safety
 
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
does the amendment that i believe we
 
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
have correct that correct the
 
02:37:44.469 --> 02:37:44.479 align:start position:0%
deficiencies that are mentioned in that
 
02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
particular sentence yes it does sir
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh one
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
thing i'm i'm a little curious about is
 
02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:05.990 align:start position:0%
thing i'm i'm a little curious about is
um

02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:08.389 --> 02:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
how the determination is made that a
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
that a woman is pregnant i know that
 
02:38:12.389 --> 02:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
women who are farther along will be
 
02:38:14.389 --> 02:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
obviously showing women who aren't
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
that far along though could be
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
at significant risk as well do you
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
depend on
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
on self-disclosure or is there any
 
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
process to identify
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
this when women are input into the
 
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
system um so it's actually determined by
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
our medical staff they will conduct
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
testing if necessary
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
senior hands-raised i want to thank the

02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%

representative muse the chair may
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
inquire of a question
 
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.510 align:start position:0%
inquire of a question
if

02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:41:33.670 --> 02:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
we were to hold an executive session on
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
would you be inclined to make a motion
 
02:41:47.269 --> 02:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
about to pass as amended and perhaps
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna hope the dean is quick to the
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
gun and
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%

02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
the executive session on senate bill
 
02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:15.510 align:start position:0%
the executive session on senate bill
393

02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%

02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
this time the chair will recognize
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair i move uh amendment uh 13 uh 44
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%

02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh 393. fn ought to pass
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
so the motion's ought to pass and wish
 
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
to offer an amendment and is there a
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
second oh that is the second by
 
02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
and representative you wish to
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
yes this is a situation um
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
that that most likely doesn't happen
 
02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
extremely frequent frequently in our
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
system but i think
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's an area where i think we've heard a
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
pretty compelling case today to
 
02:43:06.319 --> 02:43:07.349 align:start position:0%
pretty compelling case today to
um

02:43:07.349 --> 02:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:09.269 --> 02:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh to do something that protects women
 
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
and their and their children um
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
this is a um
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
this is a policy and a law that uh that
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
other states have um and this is one
 
02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we need i i have uh i've heard
 
02:43:27.030 --> 02:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
about some of the inconsistencies in the
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
county system
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh and the idea that we could actually
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
begin to address some of them
 
02:43:34.469 --> 02:43:34.479 align:start position:0%
more consistently and we can put this
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
into statute so it becomes the law of
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
as opposed to just a policy
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
that can be changed at any time by a
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
by a new
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department of
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
corrections i think is a very good thing
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of work has gone into not only the
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
but also the amendment and getting all
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the parties to agree
 
02:44:01.429 --> 02:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
that this is the way to go
 
02:44:01.439 --> 02:44:02.070 align:start position:0%
that this is the way to go
and

02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:44:02.080 --> 02:44:03.190 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:10.640 align:start position:0%

i agree with everything representative
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
you just said
 
02:44:18.469 --> 02:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
there all the stakeholders seem to be on
 
02:44:20.309 --> 02:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
board at the same time
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and and i i would i would go on a
 
02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
limb and say that anyone who considers
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
themselves to be pro-life um

the

04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:28.229 --> 04:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
with the amendment my under
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation is
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
it would have been a study committee
 
04:06:34.710 --> 04:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
consisting of one member of the
 
04:06:36.150 --> 04:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
other body
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
in two members of the other body and
 
04:06:53.269 --> 04:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
it just it changes them the uh makeup of
 
04:06:59.269 --> 04:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.510 --> 04:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
but i think the scope of what the study
 
04:07:03.269 --> 04:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
committee would be doing
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
stupid but same there going to be
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
two members of the senate and one member
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
of ours yes
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
but in the
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just speaking for myself i think
 
04:07:50.630 --> 04:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
that the topic of what the study
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
committee would look into in research is
 
04:07:55.110 --> 04:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
worthy of studying we were on a
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
04:07:59.189 --> 04:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
i forget the bill number but i believe
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
is myself representative wallace and
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes and actually
 
04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
another member of your
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
same caucus as representative
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
pantologist who's not a member of this
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
that involved the transmission of lewd
 
04:08:11.520 --> 04:08:13.110 align:start position:0%
that involved the transmission of lewd
images

04:08:13.110 --> 04:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
images
 
04:08:15.189 --> 04:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
and during the committee conference it
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
was actually the sponsor of the bill
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
she's one of the representatives out of
 
04:08:20.000 --> 04:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
she's one of the representatives out of
nashua

04:08:21.670 --> 04:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
04:08:24.309 --> 04:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
noticed that we may have and it was not
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
intentional clearly not the intention of
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
that it would have actually
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
changed a penalty for you know
 
04:08:34.469 --> 04:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
transmitting loot images of miners to a
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:46.469 --> 04:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
so the idea of when they say potential
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of other laws
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
when you try to fix something that was a
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
really good example of it and keep in
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
mind at the community conference this is
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
already passed in both bodies and we're
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to we're just kind of
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
discussing we went into that thinking
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
we're discussing really minor language
 
04:09:05.349 --> 04:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
details as opposed to what came out but
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
then at that point we're like well wait
 
04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
so the whole thing really
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
i can understand why that's a concern
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
and the testimony about the inconsistent
 
04:09:14.800 --> 04:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
and the testimony about the inconsistent
penalties

04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't have my book open to it but
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
you accidentally record someone
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's a class a misdemeanor if
 
04:09:23.920 --> 04:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
it's a class a misdemeanor if
someone's

04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
appearing in your in your window
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:42.070 --> 04:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
well it makes me so happy that you know
 
04:09:43.750 --> 04:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
that well
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
it warms the cockles of my eyes
 
04:09:48.149 --> 04:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
chuckles when she says it too
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
well i'm just saying if it were to
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
happen the person peering in the window
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
because the person may not
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
own or possess anything any device that
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
can can do that i'm just my point i'm
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
making is
 
04:10:01.670 --> 04:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
that the penalty for that could be it
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
says misdemeanor which mean it could be
 
04:10:04.710 --> 04:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
a class b misdemeanor so it's actually a
 
04:10:07.110 --> 04:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
less penalty to spy on someone who's
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
engaging in an intimate act
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
or just looking in the window you know a
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
bedroom of minor children there's no
 
04:10:15.030 --> 04:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
distinction between minors and adults
 
04:10:17.429 --> 04:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
literally you can be doing that
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
and face a lesser penalty just now i can
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
sit on my phone and by accidentally turn
 
04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
on the recording
 
04:10:25.670 --> 04:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
device and i'm committing a a greater
 
04:10:25.680 --> 04:10:27.030 align:start position:0%
device and i'm committing a a greater
offense

04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
offense
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not hearing that's happening in how
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
these are enforced but you see the
 
04:10:32.229 --> 04:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies there
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
and to fix those without making other
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.439 --> 04:10:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
seeing

04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
oh we need someone to make the motion
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me if ought to pass as amended
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
represent espio
 
04:10:53.670 --> 04:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended uh make the
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
motion up uh to move out to pass as
 
04:10:55.680 --> 04:10:57.030 align:start position:0%
motion up uh to move out to pass as
amended

04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
amended
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
and as seconded by representative
 
04:10:58.080 --> 04:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
and as seconded by representative
pantologis

04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh any further discussion
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
representing true
 
04:11:07.680 --> 04:11:08.630 align:start position:0%
representing true
um

04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
this the with the as amended this bill
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
could change all sorts of uh
 
04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
bills for uh committees uh study
 
04:11:19.110 --> 04:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
committees coming out of the senate if
 
04:11:20.469 --> 04:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
the senate is going to jump on board
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
this which i'm not sure they will
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'm still looking at a
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the second year of the session
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't see how much value that's
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to uh going to create
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
i did hear testimony that there's uh
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's just so many other bills some of
 
04:11:46.870 --> 04:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
the other rsas that are affected by
 
04:11:50.070 --> 04:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
changes to 644.9 that we need to have a
 
04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
for that to hold
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
any time you submit a bill you would
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
need to have a study committee first
 
04:11:59.760 --> 04:12:01.030 align:start position:0%
need to have a study committee first
because

04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
time you amend anything it affects other
 
04:12:03.279 --> 04:12:06.309 align:start position:0%
time you amend anything it affects other
rsas

04:12:06.309 --> 04:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:09.110 --> 04:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
i don't see the value in a
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
coming out
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
with their recommendations sometime in
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
november to uh
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
although i do i do a smile at the
 
04:12:24.640 --> 04:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
although i do i do a smile at the
amendment

04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:30.479 --> 04:12:31.189 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:12:31.189 --> 04:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
the points well taken i just know with
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
with this particular area of law
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
we want to be
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
very certain that we don't
 
04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
do what we almost did in the committee
 
04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
conference which was again not the
 
04:12:47.110 --> 04:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i agree that there is a short window
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
of time for that report to be put
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
together and
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
we'll uh
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're able to
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
work that out within the time frame that
 
04:12:59.110 --> 04:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:13:01.670 --> 04:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
represented pantologists
 
04:13:02.710 --> 04:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
a little
 
04:13:02.720 --> 04:13:03.830 align:start position:0%
a little
ins

04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
ins
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
well a little knowledge someone that's
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
been here a while we've always done this
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
in order to get
 
04:13:12.389 --> 04:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
a law that
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
could be put in in the session to come
 
04:13:16.469 --> 04:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
in session
 
04:13:19.110 --> 04:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
so it would be clear that what they were
 
04:13:21.590 --> 04:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
doing if it was a study committee and
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
this law has been
 
04:13:27.429 --> 04:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
a number of times been questioned over
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
what it's what it's for and what's not
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
for and how it's done
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
so i think the study committee would be
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
i did want to say that i i understand
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
the reservations about having a study
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee in the second year
 
04:13:47.199 --> 04:13:48.149 align:start position:0%
committee in the second year
um

04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
but i think you know one of the things
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
we have to keep in mind with things like
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
study committees is basically one of the
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
things we signed up for and and i think
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things all of us have seen on
 
04:14:00.149 --> 04:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
are bills that come through
 
04:14:02.399 --> 04:14:03.189 align:start position:0%
are bills that come through
that

04:14:03.189 --> 04:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
really haven't been properly vetted
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
where a little bit more input a little
 
04:14:09.429 --> 04:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
bit more time
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
from other legislators could have
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
resulted in much better legislation
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
and in the case of um
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill that the chair was talking
 
04:14:17.760 --> 04:14:18.630 align:start position:0%
of the bill that the chair was talking
about

04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
um that's a bill it's actually passed
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
through our committee a couple times
 
04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
and you know we found out later on that
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's had problems so i think we
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
need to be selective but this is a good
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
example of one where we should we should
 
04:14:31.750 --> 04:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
pick it
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative speedy i realized i
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
didn't really speak on my motion but um
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to say i think that this
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
is as my colleague from portsmouth also
 
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
said this is worth studying i think it's
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
getting the right you know getting the
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
right clarification and um deciphering
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
why you know why one thing raises the
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
level of a felony while the other
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
only is a misdemeanor is important so
 
04:15:05.910 --> 04:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know and i think if we can sort that
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
out in a committee that'd be great i
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
think the amendment you know
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh clarifies that the senate will take
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
the lead on it but um
 
04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i think like
 
04:15:15.750 --> 04:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i made the motion out of pass
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%

04:15:26.149 --> 04:15:26.159 align:start position:0%

back in 2018 the legislature came
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
together behind the principle that
 
04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
criminal defendants who do not pose a
 
04:27:44.710 --> 04:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
danger to society should not be held in
 
04:27:44.720 --> 04:27:45.670 align:start position:0%
danger to society should not be held in
jail

04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
jail
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
solely because they could not afford
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
even a small amount of cash bail the
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
senate remains committed to that
 
04:27:51.359 --> 04:27:52.630 align:start position:0%
senate remains committed to that
principle

04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
principle
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
during that debate we heard repeatedly
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
that bail reform was targeted to
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
non-violent offenders and that people
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
accused of offenses such as murder rape
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
domestic assault would not be released
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
without bail if they posed a danger to
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen bail reforms abused across
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
the country with violent offenders
 
04:28:13.590 --> 04:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
walking out on one charge just to commit
 
04:28:15.269 --> 04:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
another violent crime
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire we've seen
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
defendants released back into the
 
04:28:20.229 --> 04:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
community because bail commissioners
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
felt they had no choice
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
to keep someone who could pose a danger
 
04:28:27.269 --> 04:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
to the community behind bars pending
 
04:28:29.990 --> 04:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
trial those decisions are best left to a
 
04:28:30.000 --> 04:28:31.030 align:start position:0%
trial those decisions are best left to a
judge

04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's what sb 294 does it states that
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
for defendants charged with a limited
 
04:28:36.550 --> 04:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
set of offenses
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
there would be a rebuttable presumption
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
that this person would be a danger to
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
the community they would still have the
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive a reasonable bail
 
04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
by going in front of a judge guaranteed
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
within 72 hours
 
04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
sb 294 would also address people who
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
repeatedly miss their court appearances
 
04:28:54.790 --> 04:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
if you miss three
 
04:28:56.550 --> 04:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
three court appearances
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
in a three-year period you will be held
 
04:29:01.110 --> 04:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
in pre-trial detention
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
bail should not be denied to people
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
because of their income but neither
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
should it be granted to people who have
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
proven that they cannot be trusted to
 
04:29:09.110 --> 04:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
show up in court
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
sb 294 received a strong bipartisan vote
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
of 20 to 4 in the senate and we would
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
ask for your consideration and support
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%

04:29:19.110 --> 04:29:19.120 align:start position:0%

04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to sb 294.
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and legislation should be very
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
familiar to this committee as uh it's
 
04:30:09.279 --> 04:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
familiar to this committee as uh it's
it's

04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
04:30:13.590 --> 04:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
to a bill this committee considered uh
 
04:30:17.269 --> 04:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
earlier this year sb2 sb 92
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh and and the this legislation in our
 
04:30:22.870 --> 04:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
view has a lot of the same
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh issues that that bill had uh this
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill will unnecessarily limit judicial
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
discretion discretion and increase jail
 
04:30:30.880 --> 04:30:32.389 align:start position:0%
discretion discretion and increase jail
populations

04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
populations
 
04:30:35.189 --> 04:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
and uh this bill is
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's a little more targeted than than
 
04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
the house bill that this committee
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
considered a couple months ago uh
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
however uh it it still has uh some of
 
04:30:49.030 --> 04:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
the issues that sb92 had including uh
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
having including misdemeanors in the
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
list of crimes for for those that shall
 
04:30:55.349 --> 04:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
be held
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
under this proposal
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we will be holding those accused of
 
04:30:59.279 --> 04:31:00.550 align:start position:0%
we will be holding those accused of
misdemeanors

04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
04:31:02.950 --> 04:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
in jail uh for up to a week it's a
 
04:31:05.670 --> 04:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
72-hour window but that does not include
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
and they will be held pre-trial
 
04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
there are ways to strike a balance uh
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
with with public safety but this this
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
bill is taking machete when a scalpel
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be much more appropriate
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh furthermore sb 294 puts the burden of
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
proof on the defendant uh and not the
 
04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
state uh similar to sb 92 this bill has
 
04:31:32.229 --> 04:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
what's called the rebuttable presumption
 
04:31:32.239 --> 04:31:33.110 align:start position:0%
what's called the rebuttable presumption
uh

04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:31:33.120 --> 04:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
uh
which

04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
we believe our justice system was
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
founded on on the principle of innocent
 
04:31:40.389 --> 04:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
until proven guilty and
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
this legislation puts that burden of
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
proof onto the defendant to prove that
 
04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
they are not a danger to the public
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
that burden should always be on the
 
04:31:49.120 --> 04:31:50.309 align:start position:0%
that burden should always be on the
government

04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
not the individual since it's the
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
government accusing the individual of
 
04:31:57.110 --> 04:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
breaking the law
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
lastly this bill rolls back uh the state
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
policy that an individual should not uh
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
be held pre-trial simply because they
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
cannot afford bail
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh in contrast to a bill this body has
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
already passed sb 294
 
04:32:14.070 --> 04:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
seeks uh seeks chain to change pre-trial
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
detention for first offenses not second
 
04:32:16.399 --> 04:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
detention for first offenses not second
offenses

04:32:17.830 --> 04:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh the these accused have not been again
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
they have not been convicted of any
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
crime uh they this is pre-trial
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
detention and as the current law uh is
 
04:32:28.159 --> 04:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
detention and as the current law uh is
written

04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:32:31.110 --> 04:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh those that are a danger to the public
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
or themselves shall be held pre-trial
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
they shall not get a pr bail
 
04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
these protections already exist and the
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislature can clarify them further in
 
04:32:44.080 --> 04:32:45.269 align:start position:0%
legislature can clarify them further in
statute

04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
especially in our view when it comes to
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
felonious violent crimes in particular
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
but this this bill uh the six-page bill
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
goes way too far in the other direction
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
but once again we would be happy to work
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
with the committee to find a solution uh
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
to address this in a very targeted way
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
instead of in a broad manner on a on a
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
six-page bill that has a large fiscal
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
impact so uh for those these reasons we
 
04:33:16.390 --> 04:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to move this bill in
 
04:33:18.629 --> 04:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and i'd be happy
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative espidia
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for uh thank you chair and
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so
 
04:33:31.189 --> 04:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
what happens when folks who you know are
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
held pre-trial and then and like and
 
04:33:35.590 --> 04:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
then end up being
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh ruled innocent what have like what
 
04:33:40.869 --> 04:33:40.879 align:start position:0%
happens to them and do they you know if
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
they especially if they stay you know a
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
few days in jail
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:33:46.320 --> 04:33:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
representative

04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:47.680 --> 04:33:48.551 align:start position:0%
representative
uh

04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:50.789 --> 04:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
they're released first of all but
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of collateral consequences
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
you could lose your job you could have
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
uh parental issues
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of consequences to holding
 
04:34:01.269 --> 04:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
somebody in pretrial detention
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
beyond just the principle that that
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
these are innocent people accused of a
 
04:34:07.510 --> 04:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
crime that has not been proven
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh that that we're detaining and that
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
should be in our mind done in a very
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
targeted way towards people who are a
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
direct threat to to a community or
 
04:34:16.320 --> 04:34:19.510 align:start position:0%
direct threat to to a community or
themselves

04:34:19.510 --> 04:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative pandelacas
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
could you give me some examples of
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
people you think should be held other
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
than the ones that are listed
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:34:39.750 --> 04:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative i i i in terms of
 
04:34:43.510 --> 04:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
examples again we we've proposed a list
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
of felonious violent crimes uh these are
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
serious crimes
 
04:34:50.629 --> 04:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
and we believe that that was the intent
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the original bail reform law was was
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh that those people shall shall be held
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
pre-trial um there there's been some
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
anecdotes of of individuals being
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
released in certain areas uh that should
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
not be happening in our mind uh so again
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
having a more targeted uh approach to
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
this instead of including things like
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
domestic violence stalking that that are
 
04:35:18.150 --> 04:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
class a misdemeanors uh having that be
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
felony level crimes we think would be
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
much more appropriate follow-up
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative pandelacas you're
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow-up uh you
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned domestic violence crimes
 
04:35:34.230 --> 04:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
don't you think that they should be held
 
04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
because of
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
the tensions that
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
has arisen over that such as a husband
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
and wife in a fight or something don't
 
04:35:44.869 --> 04:35:44.879 align:start position:0%
you think they should be held
 
04:35:46.470 --> 04:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:35:48.629 --> 04:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
there are varying degrees of domestic
 
04:35:52.230 --> 04:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
violence there's a
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
felony level there's but this includes
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
class a misdemeanors which could be a
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
minor dispute uh again we we don't think
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to automatically hold
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
those people without any discretion over
 
04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
04:36:11.910 --> 04:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
degree of crime or the the degree of
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
what they're being accused of
 
04:36:17.670 --> 04:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
for up to a week in jail and potentially
 
04:36:17.680 --> 04:36:18.709 align:start position:0%
for up to a week in jail and potentially
losing

04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
losing
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh employment and and losi and creating
 
04:36:23.590 --> 04:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
more consequences in the community that
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually address the issue that
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
that may be at hand
 
04:36:30.230 --> 04:36:30.240 align:start position:0%

one of the things i'm curious about is
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh you you've kind of outlined some of
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the problems in the bill um and uh
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
something i'd like to know is are there
 
04:36:46.949 --> 04:36:46.959 align:start position:0%
specific fixes uh that we could make to
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of us that would make
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
it uh acceptable to you and that would
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
address your uh your objections
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%

that uh
 
04:37:07.349 --> 04:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
we think would would address the issue
 
04:37:10.709 --> 04:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%

04:37:14.551 --> 04:37:14.561 align:start position:0%
senate there's there's uh this bill in
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
front of us today uh we don't believe
 
04:37:20.310 --> 04:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's necessary to to pass
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
two pieces of legislation um you know
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
fixing one of one of those bills uh we
 
04:37:29.590 --> 04:37:29.600 align:start position:0%

forward but to answer your question yes
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
we we do have a proposal a proposed
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that that would better address
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative muse you recognize for a
 
04:37:44.719 --> 04:37:46.150 align:start position:0%
representative muse you recognize for a

putting you on the spot
[Laughter]

04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
are there what are some of the specific
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
things that you would recommend
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
that need to be changed in this bill
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again for the question
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative and i don't mind being on
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
the spot
 
04:38:03.359 --> 04:38:04.551 align:start position:0%
the spot
um

04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:04.561 --> 04:38:06.150 align:start position:0%
um
really

04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the length of the bill it's
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
a six-page bill um our biggest issues
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
are rebuttable presumptions uh you
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
should not have to prove your innoce
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you are not a danger to the public
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
that that should be on the government to
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
have to prove that uh the list of crimes
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
including misdemeanors
 
04:38:26.551 --> 04:38:26.561 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure some some of the
 
04:38:28.230 --> 04:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys that may be more familiar with
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
this issue uh
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
behind me uh maybe i'll give you more
 
04:38:35.189 --> 04:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
detail but those are our top line sort
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
of issues with the bill that uh just the
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
br the broadness and scope and then some
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
of those issues of of uh you know
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
flipping due process on its head in our
 
04:38:46.160 --> 04:38:50.830 align:start position:0%
flipping due process on its head in our
mind

04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.029 --> 04:38:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.390 --> 04:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
in this bill one of the things that i am
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
really concerned about
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
is the change of the word may
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking for you to clarify if my
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
interpretation is correct
 
04:39:22.310 --> 04:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
why a person should be held in
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
preventive detention
 
04:39:29.510 --> 04:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
it says the court and it has changed the
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
meaning of court
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
to judges and bail commissioners
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
so it says the court may order
 
04:39:39.510 --> 04:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
preventive detention without bail
 
04:39:41.990 --> 04:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
or an or an alternative
 
04:39:42.000 --> 04:39:44.150 align:start position:0%
or an or an alternative
um

04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
so the court has that decision and they
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
have some discretion and then when
 
04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
assuring the court appearance of a
 
04:39:50.638 --> 04:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
assuring the court appearance of a
person

04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
it says the court may
 
04:39:55.040 --> 04:39:56.868 align:start position:0%
it says the court may
require

04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
require
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
may require
 
04:39:59.440 --> 04:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
may require
preventive

04:40:00.550 --> 04:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
preventive
 
04:40:00.560 --> 04:40:01.590 align:start position:0%
preventive
detention

04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
detention
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
unless the court determines the
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence that such a
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
release will not reasonably meet the
 
04:40:07.360 --> 04:40:09.510 align:start position:0%
release will not reasonably meet the
requirements

04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:40:09.520 --> 04:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
requirements
so

04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
in the law itself right now it says may
 
04:40:16.948 --> 04:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
and then when you go down to
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
04:40:18.958 --> 04:40:21.350 align:start position:0%
where it says
about

04:40:21.350 --> 04:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:21.360 --> 04:40:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:23.360 --> 04:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
that
the

04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
person shall be detained in pre-trial
 
04:40:26.958 --> 04:40:28.708 align:start position:0%
person shall be detained in pre-trial
detention

04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
detention
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
that word has now been used in in my
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
opinion that
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the discretion that the
 
04:40:37.270 --> 04:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
court and the bail commissioners have in
 
04:40:38.868 --> 04:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
those two cases
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
would that be a correct assumption
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative yes i i would agree
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
shifting it from may to xiao removes a
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
lot of discretion uh you know not all
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
cases are alike
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
and and taking away that discretion
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh we believe puts ev puts everybody in
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
a one size fits all box
 
04:40:59.760 --> 04:41:00.948 align:start position:0%
a one size fits all box
that

04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
there should be much more attention to
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
the details of the case
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony the
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
chairman choir with the question
 
04:41:14.230 --> 04:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at roman numeral 3 b2 which
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
is page 2 lines 20-25
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
provision in that particular section
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
that you
 
04:41:27.990 --> 04:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.000 --> 04:41:29.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
sorry what were the lines again
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
that's the section regarding
 
04:41:40.868 --> 04:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
a person who's on pre-trial release
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
already someone who already has bail who
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
frequently would fail to appear
 
04:41:45.920 --> 04:41:46.708 align:start position:0%
frequently would fail to appear
at

04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
subsequent court hearings
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question mr
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
04:41:54.390 --> 04:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
again similar to to our
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
issues with with uh hb 1476
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh it it doesn't give discretion to the
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
level of crime uh and we we would again
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
like to see this much more targeted to
 
04:42:09.030 --> 04:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
actually address the issues that
 
04:42:10.708 --> 04:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
everyone's concerned about which is the
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
release of of violent criminals that
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
that may reoffend uh or violent accuse
 
04:42:18.310 --> 04:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
that may reoffend while while they're
 
04:42:18.320 --> 04:42:19.510 align:start position:0%
that may reoffend while while they're
out

04:42:19.510 --> 04:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
we think it's appropriate to protect the
 
04:42:22.948 --> 04:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
the public from
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh potential harm and and uh having that
 
04:42:28.948 --> 04:42:28.958 align:start position:0%
be targeted directly towards those
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh that are there
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh most at risk to the community
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if i
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
can just ask a follow-up so i guess my
 
04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
is if there's what would the consequence
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
then be if they can't revoke your bail
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
for frequently missing hearings
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
that have been scheduled
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
how exactly do you hold someone
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
accountable for who would
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
miss it would have to be
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
three hearings
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
at three twice in the same case or three
 
04:42:59.030 --> 04:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
times if it's more than one case in a
 
04:43:00.550 --> 04:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
three year period how do you hold
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
someone accountable in those
 
04:43:01.680 --> 04:43:03.190 align:start position:0%
someone accountable in those
circumstances

04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:43:05.110 --> 04:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
if you can't revoke their bail
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:43:08.948 --> 04:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative i i
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
our our
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
view on on uh people who are who are
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
missing hearings the the the most
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
frequent reason why individuals might
 
04:43:18.000 --> 04:43:18.868 align:start position:0%
frequent reason why individuals might
miss

04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
miss
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
a hearing is
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
transportation issues child care issues
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
employment issues
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
we don't think that that's a direct sign
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
that this person might be a threat to
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
the the the judge the court system has a
 
04:43:37.030 --> 04:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
lot of leeway in how to address uh
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
those on a case-by-case basis and we
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
think that's appropriate and should
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative bert
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for uh
 
04:43:58.150 --> 04:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
from what i'm hearing that this is a
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
isn't there current laws
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
that they could apply
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
to keep somebody in jail but they're
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
elected not to follow those laws uh
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:44:19.350 --> 04:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
it it
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
it's on a case-by-case basis i i i
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
there there have been instances from
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
what i've seen of individuals who may
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:44:32.550 --> 04:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh released that shouldn't have been but
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
again those are
 
04:44:36.310 --> 04:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's largely anecdotal uh it's targeted
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
in certain locations by and large we
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
believe that the 2018 uh reforms are
 
04:44:44.628 --> 04:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
working we've seen a red it may not be a
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
causative variable but it's one variable
 
04:44:49.110 --> 04:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
that that uh
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
crime has has reduced in the state since
 
04:44:51.360 --> 04:44:53.190 align:start position:0%
crime has has reduced in the state since
2018

04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
2018
 
04:44:53.200 --> 04:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
2018
so

04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.948 --> 04:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
i i i don't i can't answer your question
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
directly but but we believe that uh
 
04:45:02.400 --> 04:45:03.990 align:start position:0%
directly but but we believe that uh
that

04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
the law clearly states that individuals
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
who are uh who could be a threat to
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
themselves or their community
 
04:45:13.830 --> 04:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
shall be held and if that's not being
 
04:45:15.750 --> 04:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
followed the issue isn't with the law
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's with who who may be implementing it
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you for
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
um on page two the lines um
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
one through three you mentioned this
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
excluding saturdays sundays and holidays
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
the 72-hour piece
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
and with the inclusion in this bill of
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners who i believe are on
 
04:45:42.878 --> 04:45:43.750 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners who i believe are on
call

04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
call
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
at any point
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts about that
 
04:45:47.600 --> 04:45:50.070 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts about that
being

04:45:50.070 --> 04:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
long enough
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
too long
 
04:45:54.788 --> 04:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh whether these
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
saturdays sundays and holidays ought to
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
be excluded at all
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative we we believe the the the
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
length of time is is uh quite burdensome
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh the the issue of weekends holidays
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's just how the court currently
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
operates they don't operate on those
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
those days uh i can't really comment on
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
whether we should start to to do that i
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
think that that could be a question for
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
for somebody from the court system uh
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
but but
 
04:46:26.070 --> 04:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have much oppositio of a
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
position on that besides the fact that
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
these individuals who have not been
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
convicted of a crime are are being held
 
04:46:36.310 --> 04:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh for for an extended period of time
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
that can really affect uh themselves and
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:44.470 --> 04:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
04:46:45.990 --> 04:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question and i think you just
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
you just hit upon it uh
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking on page two line one uh the
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
accused uh shall
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
be detained for
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
what could be five six or seven days
 
04:47:02.718 --> 04:47:04.390 align:start position:0%
what could be five six or seven days
which

04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:47:06.390 --> 04:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
for me is problematic that's a long time
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
to hold an accused person do you have
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
less burdensome
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
less than five or six days to be held
 
04:47:20.230 --> 04:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:47:20.240 --> 04:47:21.590 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
representative

04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
again our our our view is is to make
 
04:47:26.788 --> 04:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
this entire piece of legislation simpler
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
and more targeted
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh and and part of that
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
would be uh the the length of detention
 
04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
um and and uh the crimes that that are
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:44.948 --> 04:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you for taking my my
 
04:47:48.550 --> 04:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
question again
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
um i know that one of uh afp superpowers
 
04:47:53.590 --> 04:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
influencing legislation at the state
 
04:47:55.440 --> 04:47:56.310 align:start position:0%
influencing legislation at the state
level

04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm curious about
 
04:47:58.638 --> 04:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm curious about
uh

04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:01.590 --> 04:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that new hampshire was not the
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
only state to implement bail reform in
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
the 2018-2019
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh time frame
 
04:48:10.550 --> 04:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
are there other states that have had
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
similar issues come up
 
04:48:12.400 --> 04:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
similar issues come up
and

04:48:13.750 --> 04:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:16.550 --> 04:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
have any states address those in a way
 
04:48:16.560 --> 04:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
have any states address those in a way
that

04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
is acceptable to you
 
04:48:19.120 --> 04:48:19.990 align:start position:0%
is acceptable to you
and

04:48:19.990 --> 04:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:20.000 --> 04:48:20.868 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:20.878 --> 04:48:21.990 align:start position:0%
um
that

04:48:21.990 --> 04:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:22.000 --> 04:48:22.788 align:start position:0%
that
that

04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
that does
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
in ways that don't raise the same
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
concerns that sb 294 raise
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:48:33.350 --> 04:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative i i don't uh really have
 
04:48:35.670 --> 04:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
a great answer of of the differences
 
04:48:37.110 --> 04:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of states that have
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
implemented changes to pre-trial uh over
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
the past few years they vary greatly uh
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
depending on on the location um you know
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
in in many instances there's been a lot
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
of stories in a location of of people
 
04:48:53.760 --> 04:48:54.708 align:start position:0%
of stories in a location of of people
being

04:48:54.708 --> 04:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
constantly released i i'm not sure what
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
the direct cause of that can be there's
 
04:49:02.868 --> 04:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different variables
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
but specifically in new hampshire we
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
haven't had a massive problem
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
of people
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know especially people accused of
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
violent crimes being released but in
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
those cases where that is happening we
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
do not view that as being appropriate
 
04:49:20.160 --> 04:49:21.110 align:start position:0%
do not view that as being appropriate
and

04:49:21.110 --> 04:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:21.120 --> 04:49:22.390 align:start position:0%
and
again

04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:49:25.830 --> 04:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
we are perfectly fine with codifying uh
 
04:49:28.550 --> 04:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
that in into statute to be very very
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
clear that these people should should
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
not be uh released uh but it should not
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
be broad and it should not include
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
things that you will not uh serve jail
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
time or prison time for
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
if convicted
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
like misdemeanors
 
04:49:52.868 --> 04:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
if the chairman inquires of a question
 
04:49:54.878 --> 04:49:55.750 align:start position:0%
if the chairman inquires of a question
and

04:49:55.750 --> 04:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:59.830 --> 04:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to page 2 lines 34-37
 
04:50:03.030 --> 04:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to page three
 
04:50:04.550 --> 04:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
lines one through
 
04:50:04.560 --> 04:50:06.470 align:start position:0%
lines one through
seven

04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
similar questions i asked
 
04:50:08.400 --> 04:50:10.470 align:start position:0%
similar questions i asked
earlier

04:50:10.470 --> 04:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:50:12.550 --> 04:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
that that policy has to do with someone
 
04:50:14.788 --> 04:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
who's been released
 
04:50:16.868 --> 04:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
on bail they have conditions of the bail
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
they've been arrested for either drunk
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
driving a class a misdemeanor or a
 
04:50:20.878 --> 04:50:21.990 align:start position:0%
driving a class a misdemeanor or a
felony

04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
felony
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then now i've been arrested a third
 
04:50:23.760 --> 04:50:25.510 align:start position:0%
and then now i've been arrested a third
time

04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:50:27.510 --> 04:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
while out on bail
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
for again basically excluding violations
 
04:50:31.510 --> 04:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
and class b misdemeanors with the
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
exception of drunk driving
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
is there any alternative language you
 
04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
to that par that section
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
as oppo
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question question
 
04:50:52.550 --> 04:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
we can certainly provide suggestions uh
 
04:50:57.510 --> 04:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
on language uh if the the committee so
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
chooses i'll point out when it comes to
 
04:51:03.750 --> 04:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
secondary third offenses uh this body
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
did pass a a a a bill that addresses
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
those uh those concerns uh we were
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to that as well for for the
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
broadness uh
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
of of the crimes that were included it
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
was pretty across the board uh but we do
 
04:51:23.430 --> 04:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
have a language that that could improve
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
that of being much more targeted and
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
focused on on on the crimes that uh
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
everyone is concerned about
 
04:51:33.750 --> 04:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
and if i just ask a follow-up again my
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
concern is if if someone were to
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
continuously get arrested while out on
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
bail or
 
04:51:40.948 --> 04:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
two three times now
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's no consequence for
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
violating the conditions of your bail
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is what is the
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
purpose of having conditions of the of
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
your bail in the first place
 
04:51:54.550 --> 04:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
again we we just don't want to see it
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
across the board very broad uh but in a
 
04:52:03.910 --> 04:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
more targeted way if if somebody is out
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
on bail and they're constantly being
 
04:52:08.470 --> 04:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
rearrested that is an issue and we had
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
provided some language to the committee
 
04:52:12.230 --> 04:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
04:52:15.910 --> 04:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
hb 1476 that specifically dealt with uh
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know some of the trespass issues
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
04:52:21.590 --> 04:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh violent crime issues
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
but uh you know to keep in mind is
 
04:52:27.670 --> 04:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that might be out on on uh on
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
bail gets arrested for uh cannabis
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
possession that's a class a misdemeanor
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
and and you you could be requiring them
 
04:52:37.030 --> 04:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
to be detained
 
04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
um for
 
04:52:41.670 --> 04:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
again upwards of a week um
 
04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
for for a crime that's uh in a lot of
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
people's mind not not a very serious
 
04:52:46.798 --> 04:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
people's mind not not a very serious
offense

04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
offense
 
04:52:50.868 --> 04:52:50.878 align:start position:0%
uh and certainly not a threat to the
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
community so those are the sort of
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
situations that we we just don't think
 
04:52:55.760 --> 04:52:56.708 align:start position:0%
situations that we we just don't think
that

04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:52:58.628 --> 04:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
having uh
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
no discretion over the level of offense
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
uh is is the best way to go we we think
 
04:53:08.788 --> 04:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
respecting due process and having that
 
04:53:08.798 --> 04:53:10.070 align:start position:0%
respecting due process and having that
discretion

04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
04:53:14.230 --> 04:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you can clarify a little bit of
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
maybe my misunderstanding of what
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
rebuttal is
 
04:53:31.350 --> 04:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
um so it says
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
this it says there is a rebut a
 
04:53:33.440 --> 04:53:36.550 align:start position:0%
this it says there is a rebut a
rebuttable

04:53:36.550 --> 04:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:36.560 --> 04:53:39.350 align:start position:0%
 
assumption

04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
there shall be a rebuttable and this is
 
04:53:44.390 --> 04:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
line 23 24. there shall be a rebuttable
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
presumption that release will not
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
reasonably assure appearance
 
04:53:48.958 --> 04:53:50.230 align:start position:0%
reasonably assure appearance
in

04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
the of the person as required
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
so that's the face that kind of puts the
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
the emphasis on the on the person that
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
has been arrested as opposed to being
 
04:54:00.868 --> 04:54:00.878 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty
 
04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
but then and that's where the law used
 
04:54:03.830 --> 04:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
to end
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
that was the end of the law and it went
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
back and said the court which means bail
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
commissions and judges
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
when they took if they found that there
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
was evidence that
 
04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
that the person should be held either
 
04:54:17.590 --> 04:54:17.600 align:start position:0%
because of dangerousness or not
 
04:54:17.600 --> 04:54:19.350 align:start position:0%
because of dangerousness or not
appearing

04:54:19.350 --> 04:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
appearing
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
um they would be able to do that but
 
04:54:24.230 --> 04:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
then by ending that sentence with the
 
04:54:24.240 --> 04:54:25.270 align:start position:0%
then by ending that sentence with the
words

04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
and the person shall be detained in
 
04:54:27.360 --> 04:54:28.788 align:start position:0%
and the person shall be detained in
pre-bio

04:54:28.788 --> 04:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
pre-bio
 
04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
to me that means that
 
04:54:38.230 --> 04:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
the judge and the bail commissioners no
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
longer have the opportunity to to review
 
04:54:40.878 --> 04:54:42.470 align:start position:0%
longer have the opportunity to to review
the

04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
what's going on what kind of evidence
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
there is to keep the person in in
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
custody which certainly i would presume
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
is the number of times that they have
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
failed to show up
 
04:54:57.190 --> 04:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
so the shell cancels it out and takes
 
04:54:59.350 --> 04:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
away the rebut ability if there is such
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
a word am i incorrect in that kind of
 
04:55:01.520 --> 04:55:02.868 align:start position:0%
a word am i incorrect in that kind of
assumption

04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
i i would probably defer to somebody
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
behind me uh that is more familiar with
 
04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
this but really rebuttable uh
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
you know presumption
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
it flips the the burden on the defendant
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
and that is not how our justice system
 
04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
is supposed to work
 
04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
it is it should be upon the government
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the justice system to prove
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
that that an individual is guilty of a
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
crime or is a danger to the public in
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
this case
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
the witness for his testimony thank you
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
and for the members of the committee
 
04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
there is um i have to thank
 
04:55:54.628 --> 04:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
i think brad our committee assistant for
 
04:55:57.190 --> 04:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
putting this together together
 
04:56:00.150 --> 04:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
there is a side-by-side analysis of
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
what the bill is before us right now
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 294
 
04:56:04.160 --> 04:56:05.590 align:start position:0%
senate bill 294
and

04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
what was senate bill 290
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
senate bill 92 has amended its 2-1 the
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.550 --> 04:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have the side-by-side
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:34.470 --> 04:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman representatives
 
04:56:39.430 --> 04:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
is this bill
 
04:56:44.310 --> 04:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:45.910 --> 04:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say representative
 
04:56:45.920 --> 04:56:47.830 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say representative
bradley

04:56:47.830 --> 04:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
bradley
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.230 --> 04:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
i i'll let me just clarify what so
 
04:56:58.390 --> 04:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
senate we had a bill
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
last year senate bill 92
 
04:57:02.230 --> 04:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
and it passed in this committee with an
 
04:57:04.708 --> 04:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
amendment now it was ultimately tabled
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
so it was not
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
voted on it you know at least on its
 
04:57:07.040 --> 04:57:08.628 align:start position:0%
voted on it you know at least on its
merits

04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
merits
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
the side-by-side i was referring to now
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
this bill by the way senate bill 294 is
 
04:57:15.750 --> 04:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
very similar to the
 
04:57:17.990 --> 04:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
the original draft of senate bill 92
 
04:57:20.550 --> 04:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
that passed in the senate last year
 
04:57:22.788 --> 04:57:22.798 align:start position:0%
the side by side that
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant put together for
 
04:57:24.240 --> 04:57:25.110 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant put together for
us

04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:57:27.110 --> 04:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
is the amended version that passed in
 
04:57:28.788 --> 04:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
the committee last year as opposed to
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
what is
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
290 senate bill 294 as introduced
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
and there are there are some
 
04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
significant differences just
 
04:57:38.070 --> 04:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to make sure everyone
 
04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative bourne
 
04:57:50.150 --> 04:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh uh this analysis
 
04:57:52.310 --> 04:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
is interesting but uh where's the
 
04:57:55.150 --> 04:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
side-by-side analysis of
 
04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
1476. since it's a bill that we've uh
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
passed relatively recently
 
04:58:03.990 --> 04:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i think the committee
 
04:58:05.910 --> 04:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
was more comfortable with than either
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
these two
 
04:58:07.520 --> 04:58:12.830 align:start position:0%
these two
versions

04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:16.230 --> 04:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
well i there is i'm sure there's there's
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
room to put another additional
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
side-by-side or a third
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
third version i think with hp 1476
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
that really had a narrow application
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
that'd do it with someone who was
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
already released on bail
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
and they were to get arrested all that
 
04:58:30.240 --> 04:58:31.350 align:start position:0%
and they were to get arrested all that
did

04:58:31.350 --> 04:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
for mo for the most part was
 
04:58:35.830 --> 04:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
he would bring you before a judge for
 
04:58:37.270 --> 04:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
your bail hearing as opposed to a bail
 
04:58:37.280 --> 04:58:38.390 align:start position:0%
your bail hearing as opposed to a bail
commissioner

04:58:38.390 --> 04:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at the third paragraph i'm
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
sorry page two at the bottom
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
line's 34 37
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
on the page three
 
04:58:47.990 --> 04:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
lines one through seven that's
 
04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
although it looks
 
04:58:51.830 --> 04:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
similar to what 1476 would have done
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually very different because
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
in that case
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening when you're now
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
in in the court and deciding whether to
 
04:59:00.550 --> 04:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
revoke your bail and hold you
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
in pre-trial detention what that's doing
 
04:59:04.550 --> 04:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
is saying you continuously violate the
 
04:59:06.310 --> 04:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
conditions of your release
 
04:59:07.990 --> 04:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's that's when the court will make
 
04:59:12.390 --> 04:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
that decision this is what 1476 did
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
we're just holding you we're not going
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
to release you let you go before bail
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner you're going before a judge
 
04:59:19.830 --> 04:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding that's that's
 
04:59:21.670 --> 04:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
really kind of a cliff notes version but
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
i can have
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
i can ask brad to greenland to put them
 
04:59:25.280 --> 04:59:26.230 align:start position:0%
i can ask brad to greenland to put them
together

04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
and make a
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:37.190 --> 05:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
05:00:39.990 --> 05:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the opportunity to
 
05:00:41.750 --> 05:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is frank knack i'm
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
the policy director with the aclu of new
 
05:00:45.110 --> 05:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are here in strong
 
05:00:49.830 --> 05:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't want to read my
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
the documents i sent out verbatim so
 
05:00:55.510 --> 05:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll just try and summarize them quickly
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
i think the first point we want to make
 
05:00:59.190 --> 05:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
is that we should be really here focused
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
on how we can make our community safer
 
05:01:03.030 --> 05:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
and if our goal here is to make our
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
community safer then this is the
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
absolute worst thing that we could do
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
so just more recently between when this
 
05:01:12.628 --> 05:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
when 1476 was heard in this committee
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
and today another report came out funded
 
05:01:18.150 --> 05:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
by arnold ventures which is a well-known
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
national organization working on
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice reform and state state
 
05:01:21.600 --> 05:01:22.550 align:start position:0%
criminal justice reform and state state
level

05:01:22.550 --> 05:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
and they uh the study they funded looked
 
05:01:27.430 --> 05:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
at 1.5 million people booked into
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
kentucky jails between 2009 and 2018
 
05:01:31.520 --> 05:01:32.948 align:start position:0%
kentucky jails between 2009 and 2018
pre-trial

05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
pre-trial
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
pre-trial um and looked at
 
05:01:37.190 --> 05:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
the out the outcome of that and this was
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
a study that was following up on
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
research they'd done a few years back
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
and so a few years back their findings
 
05:01:44.788 --> 05:01:44.798 align:start position:0%
found that after three days of pre-trial
 
05:01:47.430 --> 05:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration the net public safety
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
benefit went away and actually it was
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
the person was more likely to commit a
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
new crime after being held for three
 
05:01:54.550 --> 05:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
days or more
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
their more recent research which looked
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
at 1.5 million people actually realized
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
that their earlier estimates were
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
incorrect and that any time over 24
 
05:02:03.200 --> 05:02:04.948 align:start position:0%
incorrect and that any time over 24
hours

05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
actually had a net public safety harm
 
05:02:09.110 --> 05:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
and they found that you know that
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
jailing people pre-trial in the majority
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
of cases is absolutely the worst thing
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
that we could do and that we should
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
actually instead be focusing on
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
community-based solutions treatment
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
substance use etc to actually address
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
the underlying causes of what are
 
05:02:24.470 --> 05:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
leading people into the jail most the
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
vast majority of times and they also
 
05:02:28.390 --> 05:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
went out of the way to note that this
 
05:02:30.150 --> 05:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
was an outlier research that this was
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with decades of research on
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
carceral approaches
 
05:02:36.390 --> 05:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
to to offenses like this
 
05:02:38.070 --> 05:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
and so again if we're focused on public
 
05:02:40.868 --> 05:02:40.878 align:start position:0%
safety this bill is a really is a
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
solution that we should there is a
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
is a
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
is a direction that we should not be
 
05:02:46.550 --> 05:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
going in
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
and again i think it's really important
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
important to note
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
existing law allows judges and bail
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners the power to hold anyone
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
pre-trial if they determine them to be a
 
05:02:57.680 --> 05:02:58.628 align:start position:0%
pre-trial if they determine them to be a
danger

05:02:58.628 --> 05:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
danger
 
05:03:01.030 --> 05:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
or a flight risk and if you'll know in
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
the packet i sent i just handed out and
 
05:03:05.510 --> 05:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
i emailed the committee this morning i
 
05:03:07.590 --> 05:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
noted the multiple parts in current law
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
that already allow
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
the courts to hold people pre-trial
 
05:03:14.310 --> 05:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
including if they commit a new crime
 
05:03:15.990 --> 05:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's also a section that hasn't been
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
discussed where
 
05:03:19.350 --> 05:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement where the state can
 
05:03:22.708 --> 05:03:22.718 align:start position:0%
actually appeal a decision by the court
 
05:03:24.550 --> 05:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of releasing someone so if they
 
05:03:26.550 --> 05:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
think the court got it wrong there's a
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
provision in existing law where they can
 
05:03:31.510 --> 05:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
they can challenge that and quote should
 
05:03:31.520 --> 05:03:32.470 align:start position:0%
they can challenge that and quote should
be

05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
determined promptly by the courts
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
and so again we already have mechanisms
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
in place what this does in concurrent
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
laws ensures that is individualized
 
05:03:43.670 --> 05:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
determinations not blanket solutions
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
that will nest and they needlessly
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerate potentially thousands of
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
people annually
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
and again it's also important to note
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
um that you know we've heard fear
 
05:03:56.470 --> 05:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
tactics from these proponents of this
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that you know quote unquote
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
our you know our communities are less
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
safe and so we actually unfortunately
 
05:04:03.270 --> 05:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
there was an article in the concord
 
05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
monitor this morning that noted that you
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
know there was an attempt by um by the
 
05:04:10.230 --> 05:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
state to do an assessment of the 2018
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
reforms and the data that they needed to
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
do that wasn't actually collected and so
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
from our perspective if we're talking
 
05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
about needlessly incarcerating a bill
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
that can incarcerate thousands of people
 
05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
we should actually look at the data
 
05:04:24.550 --> 05:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
first to see if there is in fact a
 
05:04:26.948 --> 05:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
problem rather than just a few anecdotal
 
05:04:28.708 --> 05:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
stories that we're hearing that are not
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
that are not being provided with any
 
05:04:30.240 --> 05:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
that are not being provided with any
actual

05:04:31.270 --> 05:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
actual
 
05:04:34.310 --> 05:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
data to show that there's a problem
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
and if you actually look at crime stats
 
05:04:38.390 --> 05:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
since bail reform went into effect and
 
05:04:40.470 --> 05:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
again i noted
 
05:04:43.350 --> 05:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
in the packet i handed out
 
05:04:45.910 --> 05:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
the crime statistics statewide for both
 
05:04:49.350 --> 05:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
group a and group b for both arrests and
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
for new crimes they're down
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
substantially since bail reform went to
 
05:04:55.430 --> 05:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
effects of statewide group a crimes
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
which are the vast majority of offenses
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
down 14.3 percent arrest down 22.6
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
percent and i also noted the stats from
 
05:05:04.230 --> 05:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
the two police departments where the
 
05:05:05.830 --> 05:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
chiefs have testified before you all
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
about the need
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
um to roll back bail reform and
 
05:05:10.470 --> 05:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
needlessly incarcerate thousands of
 
05:05:10.480 --> 05:05:12.550 align:start position:0%
needlessly incarcerate thousands of
people

05:05:12.550 --> 05:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
and finally i want to i want to talk
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
about a few aspects of this specific
 
05:05:17.910 --> 05:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill so again this is a very broad bill
 
05:05:19.350 --> 05:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
compared to the bill you all heard
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
earlier this year as chairman abbas
 
05:05:24.708 --> 05:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
noted it's more similar to the sb 92
 
05:05:25.910 --> 05:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
which this
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
this body tabled a few months back
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
but in terms of failure to appear
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
as my colleague from afp noted you know
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
the current law gives judicial
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
discretion to incar to hold people
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
pre-trial if they fail to appear for a
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
certain number of times but again people
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
are not failing to appear because
 
05:05:45.910 --> 05:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're trying to skip their court date
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of times people are
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
failing to appear
 
05:05:51.110 --> 05:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
because of child care because of
 
05:05:52.310 --> 05:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
transportation issues things that are
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
outside the control and if we're really
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
concerned with addressing the fta issue
 
05:06:00.390 --> 05:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
there are data-driven solutions to doing
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
that that other states have been doing
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
including text messaging text alerts
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
that have been shown to actually reduce
 
05:06:08.310 --> 05:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
fta rates and not not needlessly
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerate individuals
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
and again
 
05:06:14.310 --> 05:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
on the re-arrest issue
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
this bill compared to
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
sb1476 which you all heard a few weeks
 
05:06:18.878 --> 05:06:20.070 align:start position:0%
sb1476 which you all heard a few weeks
back

05:06:20.070 --> 05:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:06:21.830 --> 05:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
this bill includes all
 
05:06:23.590 --> 05:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
any if you're arrested for any offense
 
05:06:25.350 --> 05:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
and then rearrested for any offense
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
including class b misdemeanors you are
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
mandatorily held this bill takes away
 
05:06:32.150 --> 05:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion so again if we're
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about from a public safety
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
perspective this is the wrong solution
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
05:06:38.788 --> 05:06:38.798 align:start position:0%
and we urge that this committee oppose
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:49.830 --> 05:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative pandelagas
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
you just gave off some statistics about
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
crime being done down
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
did we not just go through two years of
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
staying home
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
would we not have
 
05:07:07.350 --> 05:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
crime gone down because of that
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
so the data i showed you shows 2018 2019
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
so even in those two years which are pre
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
the first year bail form and pre-coveted
 
05:07:17.670 --> 05:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
crime was down even in those two years
 
05:07:19.670 --> 05:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
so and i'm not saying that bail reform
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
is the reason that crime is down but
 
05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is that the notion that
 
05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
somehow bail form is making our
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
communities less safe is not supported
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
by any data but i do agree that you know
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
crime rates are skewed potentially
 
05:07:33.990 --> 05:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
because of covid so we also included uh
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
2018 2019 which is pre-covered
 
05:07:37.280 --> 05:07:38.788 align:start position:0%
2018 2019 which is pre-covered
follow-up

05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative and the re-arrest
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's being done
 
05:07:47.190 --> 05:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
um how do i explain to my constituent
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
that the gentleman next door broke up
 
05:07:53.510 --> 05:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
the apartment broke out the windows they
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
arrested him
 
05:07:58.390 --> 05:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
he comes home two hours later
 
05:08:01.190 --> 05:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
it happens again
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
they asked me
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
why their police department has to put
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
up with this man why he isn't held for a
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
rest can you explain to me why we
 
05:08:14.708 --> 05:08:14.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing that
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
so under existing law the judge the
 
05:08:19.350 --> 05:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
court has the ability to hold that
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
person pre-trial and under existing law
 
05:08:23.670 --> 05:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
the government has the ability to
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
challenge the court's decision if they
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
release them and so
 
05:08:28.948 --> 05:08:28.958 align:start position:0%
we think it's best that the we give the
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
courts you know uh the authority to make
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
very serious decisions on all kinds of
 
05:08:34.000 --> 05:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
very serious decisions on all kinds of
matters

05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
matters
 
05:08:37.030 --> 05:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
all the time and there's this is no
 
05:08:38.550 --> 05:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
difference so we have judicial
 
05:08:40.230 --> 05:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
discretion courts can make that
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
determination if the state doesn't like
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
that determination they have in a
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism under existing law to appeal
 
05:08:47.910 --> 05:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
that and i think it's also important to
 
05:08:50.070 --> 05:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
really recognize that for the vast
 
05:08:52.550 --> 05:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
majority of these individuals
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people with
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
underlying substance use underlying
 
05:08:57.030 --> 05:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
under other you know unhoused situations
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
those are the issues that we should
 
05:09:03.030 --> 05:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
really be focused on and if you look at
 
05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
the research from arnold ventures that's
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
what it really talks about that we
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
should be focused on are the you know
 
05:09:09.590 --> 05:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
the drivers of what's making our
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
communities less safe and not in
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that putting people in jail
 
05:09:16.070 --> 05:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
is the worst thing that we can do
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:09:20.550 --> 05:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if the
 
05:09:24.470 --> 05:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
in your opinion uh is enough and ensures
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
that dangerous people can be held
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
what in europe
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
why in your opinion are we running into
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh to issues issues like this if the law
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
itself isn't a problem
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i i would actually really look at see
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that we actually don't have
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
data to show that there is a problem
 
05:09:48.788 --> 05:09:48.798 align:start position:0%
we've heard a few anecdotal stories that
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
there are some issues um you know that
 
05:09:53.190 --> 05:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
could be solved by better training of
 
05:09:55.750 --> 05:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners better you know more
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
you know ensuring that we have more
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
judges more bail commissioners you know
 
05:10:00.390 --> 05:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
there are other solutions but also you
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
know focusing on the front-end issues
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know ensuring that we have better
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
treatment programs you know there's
 
05:10:07.030 --> 05:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
data-driven programs like cahoots out in
 
05:10:09.430 --> 05:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
eugene oregon or a star program out in
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
denver colorado that are really focused
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
on addressing you know low-level
 
05:10:16.550 --> 05:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
low-level issues in terms of mental
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
health and having proper responses to
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
mental health to reducing the need for
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
policing of mental health to reduce the
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
need for our jails for mental health so
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things that we could be
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
doing as a society if we were really
 
05:10:29.990 --> 05:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
focused on public safety and this bill
 
05:10:30.868 --> 05:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
is really
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
not focused on public safety
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:10:43.110 --> 05:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:10:44.550 --> 05:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
you stated
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
there were some reasons uh child care
 
05:10:48.550 --> 05:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
and transportation what are the other
 
05:10:51.430 --> 05:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
reasons you know that some people just
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know can't show up to court and and
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
do you know what the court does with
 
05:11:00.070 --> 05:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.868 --> 05:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
so we looked at there was actually
 
05:11:06.070 --> 05:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
a study paper by
 
05:11:06.080 --> 05:11:07.110 align:start position:0%
a study paper by
the

05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
public policy research
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
program i'm looking for the name at
 
05:11:12.400 --> 05:11:13.910 align:start position:0%
program i'm looking for the name at
dartmouth

05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
dartmouth
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
that looked at the fta issue
 
05:11:17.830 --> 05:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
with regard to new hampshire and
 
05:11:19.910 --> 05:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and so what they found were
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
the main drivers were child care
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
transportation employment requirements
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
or they simply forgot
 
05:11:27.990 --> 05:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and that they in that in that
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
research paper and i have it cited in in
 
05:11:32.948 --> 05:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
my um fact sheet that i sent you all or
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
gave to you all um noted that there are
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
data-driven solutions in terms of text
 
05:11:40.230 --> 05:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
messaging etc to um ensure that people
 
05:11:42.470 --> 05:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
are more likely to show up and again i
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
think with with your question itself
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know judges have discretion if if
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
they think that there's a problem if
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
they think that the person is not
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
showing up because they're trying to
 
05:11:53.190 --> 05:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
skip their court date
 
05:11:54.868 --> 05:11:54.878 align:start position:0%
they can make that determination and
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
after the the the
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
number of uh the threshold is met they
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
can hold that person
 
05:12:02.948 --> 05:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
and so this is just but right now we
 
05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
have judicial discretion you know we're
 
05:12:06.230 --> 05:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
ensuring that judges and not we don't
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
have a robotic response we have an
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
ability of judges to look at the
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
individual individual facts in that case
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not you know
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
the person did in fact you know have a
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
car accident on the way to court and
 
05:12:19.510 --> 05:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it or their kid got sick
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't make it to court or
 
05:12:22.708 --> 05:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
you know their school you know i'm a
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
parent you know if school gets canceled
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
my day gets thrown completely
 
05:12:27.510 --> 05:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know if there's snow on the ground
 
05:12:28.788 --> 05:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
and schools canceled you know i have to
 
05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
rearrange my schedule for the day you
 
05:12:31.750 --> 05:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
know i'm lucky i have a job where i can
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
be flexible and do that but a lot of
 
05:12:34.708 --> 05:12:34.718 align:start position:0%
people don't
 
05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and so i think it's important that we
 
05:12:38.550 --> 05:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
allow judges to look at those factors um
 
05:12:40.470 --> 05:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have a uniform you know judges
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
or individuals we don't have a uniform
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
way of judges don't have a uniform you
 
05:12:44.320 --> 05:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
way of judges don't have a uniform you
know

05:12:45.030 --> 05:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
code for you know this is valid this is
 
05:12:48.708 --> 05:12:48.718 align:start position:0%
not but we do give them discretion in
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
lots of ways and
 
05:12:54.150 --> 05:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman representative
 
05:12:57.030 --> 05:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
brad you recognize for a follow-up thank
 
05:12:57.040 --> 05:12:57.750 align:start position:0%
brad you recognize for a follow-up thank
you

05:12:57.750 --> 05:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:03.590 --> 05:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
also i heard with the other bill that's
 
05:13:05.670 --> 05:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
similar to this that's being heard on
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
the other side of the granite wall
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
that the court showed up
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
about the cost of this
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that'd be on the question you know
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of this do you know what that
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
would be and what that would do with the
 
05:13:22.840 --> 05:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
would be and what that would do with the
courts

05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
courts
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
so um the court testified on this bill
 
05:13:28.948 --> 05:13:28.958 align:start position:0%
when it was over in the house so i'm not
 
05:13:30.390 --> 05:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
sure i believe
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
mr head is here from the courts i'm not
 
05:13:33.510 --> 05:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
sure if he's testifying on this matter
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
or not but when they testified on the
 
05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
house side i believe they said 1.9
 
05:13:39.670 --> 05:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
million according to the um
 
05:13:41.670 --> 05:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the hearing report
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
um and that i just also want to clarify
 
05:13:45.990 --> 05:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
that that is just state court costs and
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about potentially
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerating thousands of people we
 
05:13:50.830 --> 05:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
also have to think about the cost the
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
localities so join one person per day is
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
105 to 125 a day according to fiscal
 
05:14:00.550 --> 05:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
notes and so times that by thousands per
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
day we're talking about a lot of money
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to hit everyone's locality
 
05:14:06.310 --> 05:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
that is not included in the statewide
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal the what the court would tell you
 
05:14:13.990 --> 05:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
if the chairman may inquire with a
 
05:14:15.360 --> 05:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
if the chairman may inquire with a
question

05:14:16.550 --> 05:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:14:18.550 --> 05:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there was some i
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
think the term is anecdotal stories
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
can you provide the information on what
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
what story or what was the fact pattern
 
05:14:27.910 --> 05:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
or that story you were referring to
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'm just i'm referring to the stories
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've heard when law enforcement have
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
testified um in other hearings and then
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
in some media reports we've heard from a
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
few anecdotal stories that they've given
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
can you give some background on what the
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
you know can you put the background and
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
one of those stories around when you say
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
story i mean what what are you referring
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
to someone arrested let out what
 
05:14:51.670 --> 05:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
happened that's what the law enforcement
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
have alleged and they have i've not seen
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
any data so i can't give specifics we've
 
05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
just heard the anecdotal kind of you
 
05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
know high-level stories
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
and again we've heard nothing that you
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
know from them that you know under
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
existing law that person couldn't have
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
been you know held so i think again this
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
gets back to a data problem and that we
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
need to be focused on collecting the
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
data to see if there is in fact a
 
05:15:14.788 --> 05:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
problem and then we can have data-driven
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
solutions you know i think one of the
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
great things about
 
05:15:19.350 --> 05:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
criminal justice reform over the last
 
05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
you know decade and a half starting in
 
05:15:24.070 --> 05:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
texas in about 2008 was we were actually
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
able to collect data and look at what is
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
and what is not working and then
 
05:15:27.680 --> 05:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
and what is not working and then
construct

05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
construct
 
05:15:31.030 --> 05:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
policy solutions that are
 
05:15:33.350 --> 05:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
nearly territorial to those problems and
 
05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
i think when you do things without data
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
that's how we got to mass incarceration
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
in the first place you know we had this
 
05:15:41.190 --> 05:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction to incarcerate people
 
05:15:43.590 --> 05:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
for all types of offenses and that led
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
to us being the incarceration capital of
 
05:15:47.590 --> 05:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
the world and so i think it's important
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
that we get back to the kind of
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
data-driven solutions that have been
 
05:15:52.310 --> 05:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
effective at reducing incarceration
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
levels across the country
 
05:15:55.830 --> 05:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
and ensure that all of our policies are
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
data-driven and not rhetoric driven
 
05:16:00.310 --> 05:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you if i can ask a follow-up
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
question in regards to
 
05:16:03.990 --> 05:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
a person who fails to appear at a
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
hearing so let's begin page 2 lines
 
05:16:05.680 --> 05:16:08.070 align:start position:0%
hearing so let's begin page 2 lines
20-25

05:16:08.070 --> 05:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
20-25
 
05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
you gave an example of someone who got
 
05:16:11.510 --> 05:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
will get in a car accident on the way to
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
the court hearing
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
i would think that my own opinion that
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be an excusable reason why someone
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
didn't make it to the court
 
05:16:19.280 --> 05:16:20.390 align:start position:0%
didn't make it to the court
but

05:16:20.390 --> 05:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:16:20.400 --> 05:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
but
if

05:16:21.110 --> 05:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:16:23.190 --> 05:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that person under
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
under the bill as proposed have a
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption to show why
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
they won't miss future hearings because
 
05:16:31.830 --> 05:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
basically say well one of them i was in
 
05:16:32.708 --> 05:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
the car accident the way to the
 
05:16:32.718 --> 05:16:34.070 align:start position:0%
the car accident the way to the
courthouse

05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
in your in your opinion would that
 
05:16:38.550 --> 05:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
satisfy the rebuttable presumption or
 
05:16:38.560 --> 05:16:39.510 align:start position:0%
satisfy the rebuttable presumption or
not

05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:16:39.520 --> 05:16:40.708 align:start position:0%
not
so

05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:42.628 --> 05:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
under current law they have a runnable
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
presumption the way that this bill would
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
amend it would be actually taking away
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
that rebuttal presumption and saying the
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
the last line is and the person shall be
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
detained pre-trial
 
05:16:55.030 --> 05:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
so this is actually taking away the
 
05:16:57.350 --> 05:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion this amendment um so
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
under existing law you're absolutely
 
05:16:59.830 --> 05:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know if they're not if they if they
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't show up for the the threshold
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
number of times there's their quote
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
there shall be a rebuttable presumption
 
05:17:08.550 --> 05:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
that release would not reasonably assure
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
the appearance of the person as required
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
but as this bill is amending it it
 
05:17:14.628 --> 05:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
includes this next sentence or this next
 
05:17:17.030 --> 05:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
part of the sentence and the person
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
shall be detained pre-trial
 
05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
you're right under existing law there
 
05:17:23.910 --> 05:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
was rebuttal presumption and we're okay
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
this bill actually creates a sh takes
 
05:17:28.868 --> 05:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
puts the shell on there and mandates
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
their incarceration
 
05:17:32.628 --> 05:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
but wouldn't the rebuttable presumption
 
05:17:34.628 --> 05:17:34.638 align:start position:0%
language still remain in the law even if
 
05:17:36.470 --> 05:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
it remains in the
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
the text but the second sentence the
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
second part of that sentence says the
 
05:17:44.868 --> 05:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
person shall be detained so i think it
 
05:17:46.788 --> 05:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
would be pretty clear that they
 
05:17:49.510 --> 05:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
would be detained it it has the shell in
 
05:17:49.520 --> 05:17:52.788 align:start position:0%
would be detained it it has the shell in
there

05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:58.070 --> 05:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and so i mean it sounds like
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
there are people that we hear anecdotal
 
05:18:01.910 --> 05:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
evidence about
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
that they're in and out in and out in
 
05:18:05.830 --> 05:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
and out and it may be because they're
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know flipping off the justice
 
05:18:08.480 --> 05:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
you know flipping off the justice
um

05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:11.830 --> 05:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
commit justice
 
05:18:11.840 --> 05:18:13.350 align:start position:0%
commit justice
um

05:18:13.350 --> 05:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:13.360 --> 05:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:18:14.310 --> 05:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this with that shell in there
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
that that takes away the rebuttal i mean
 
05:18:21.670 --> 05:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you would get rebuttal after 72
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
hours but that certainly isn't the
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
solution am i
 
05:18:27.270 --> 05:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense to you
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean it's definitely a little
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
confusing i think the language
 
05:18:32.230 --> 05:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
the way it would be interpreted is that
 
05:18:33.910 --> 05:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
the shell in there is the controlling
 
05:18:35.350 --> 05:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
and they would be held and i don't mean
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
to minimize these you know anecdotal
 
05:18:38.788 --> 05:18:38.798 align:start position:0%
stories i mean these are you know
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
horrible things that are happening but
 
05:18:43.430 --> 05:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
again having a targeted solution versus
 
05:18:45.590 --> 05:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
this one-size-fits-all solution
 
05:18:47.190 --> 05:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
we can't legislate i mean i think it's
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's um
 
05:18:51.590 --> 05:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
not right to legislate based on anecdote
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so we we should really really focus
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
05:19:04.470 --> 05:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
05:19:06.390 --> 05:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
kanek for taking the question so it's
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
different parts to this bill um
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the back half i think is addressed
 
05:19:14.230 --> 05:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
largely in hp 1476 which just left this
 
05:19:14.240 --> 05:19:15.110 align:start position:0%
largely in hp 1476 which just left this
chamber

05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
and then there's the beginning part
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
which deals with folks who are charged
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
what is the position of the aclu around
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
holding people charged with serious
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
crimes where there's an a true victim
 
05:19:33.190 --> 05:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
and getting him before a judge and and
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
making a decision on bail is that
 
05:19:35.830 --> 05:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
um that your group would support
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
so i believe this has
 
05:19:42.550 --> 05:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
a rebuttable presumption that they're a
 
05:19:45.350 --> 05:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
danger to the public um which we think
 
05:19:47.750 --> 05:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
again under existing law anyone can be
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
held pre-trial
 
05:19:50.628 --> 05:19:50.638 align:start position:0%
and so we think that's appropriate that
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
the judge or the the bail commissioner
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
can look at the facts in that case and
 
05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the person is a
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
danger or a flight risk to the community
 
05:19:58.868 --> 05:19:58.878 align:start position:0%
and i think it's also important to
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
remember that these are people who are
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
charged and so when the prosecutor gets
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
the case filed as you all know very
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
often happens in new hampshire charges
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
can be reduced and so just because
 
05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
someone is charged with the defense
 
05:20:10.948 --> 05:20:10.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's actually what's going
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
to happen once the prosecutor gets the
 
05:20:13.590 --> 05:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
case file
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
and so again
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
having this mandatory scheme of just
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
because you're charged with an offense
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
means that there's a rebuttable
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
presumption that you're a danger we
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
think is problematic we think existing
 
05:20:23.520 --> 05:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
think is problematic we think existing
law

05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
has many opportunities to ensure that
 
05:20:28.470 --> 05:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
people who are a danger it gives
 
05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
individualized determination to see if
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
they are a danger and if they are they
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
can be held and that's appropriate
 
05:20:36.390 --> 05:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
but the rebuttable presumption i think
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
is is problematic
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative connolly recognized for a
 
05:20:43.270 --> 05:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you mr chairman this is
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
actually a different topic altogether
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
but i'm curious about that the number
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
that's been used by opponents that
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
thousands of folks would be swept up i
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
mean how many i mean i live in dover
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
which is one of the largest cities in
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
the state we have weeks where there's
 
05:20:58.948 --> 05:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
just a handful of people arrested so
 
05:21:01.590 --> 05:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
where's that number coming from
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
what time frame are we talking about and
 
05:21:05.510 --> 05:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
can you can you clarify that a little
 
05:21:07.750 --> 05:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
bit um i believe and i don't want to
 
05:21:09.590 --> 05:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
speak i believe that came from testimony
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
from the courts in terms of the number
 
05:21:13.190 --> 05:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
of people who this could impact on an
 
05:21:18.708 --> 05:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:20.310 --> 05:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
the chair may inquire of a question and
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
you heard me mention before that there
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
was a previous senate bill 92 that had
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment to it
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
and although that had the same 13
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
offenses listed
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with that amendment i
 
05:21:36.628 --> 05:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to ask about
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
that policy because it did rewrite that
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
whole majority of that section yeah i
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
have sp i think i have the amended sp 92
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.628 --> 05:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
so rather than have the rebuttable
 
05:21:48.638 --> 05:21:49.910 align:start position:0%
so rather than have the rebuttable
presumption

05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
just to sum up that policy it would
 
05:21:54.868 --> 05:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
reduce the time to 24 36 hours as
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
opposed to 72
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
and it essentially would just hold the
 
05:22:00.230 --> 05:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
person who was charged with one of those
 
05:22:02.310 --> 05:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
13 offenses
 
05:22:03.750 --> 05:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
not put them bring them before bail
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner bring them before a judge
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
in that case if the state not the
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
the state would have to prove
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
by clearing convincing evidence that
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
person posed a danger to themselves
 
05:22:17.190 --> 05:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
or to the public
 
05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that's in that scenario
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
that person then could be held
 
05:22:22.868 --> 05:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
in regard to that policy
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
would would you have any objection to
 
05:22:26.548 --> 05:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
that as written and if so would there be
 
05:22:26.558 --> 05:22:27.670 align:start position:0%
that as written and if so would there be
any

05:22:27.670 --> 05:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh changes you would make to that policy
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
oh definitely i mean i'm so looking at
 
05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
this right now
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
it is definitely less problematic than
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
the proposal in the current s294 sb294
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
but again i think as i just mentioned to
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative conley i think our
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
concerns are that these are these are
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
the charges that i mean you're so you're
 
05:22:49.990 --> 05:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
automatically detaining someone based on
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
a charge that the prosecutor when they
 
05:22:54.788 --> 05:22:54.798 align:start position:0%
get the case file made to decide was way
 
05:22:57.670 --> 05:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
way too much and so again under existing
 
05:22:57.680 --> 05:22:58.628 align:start position:0%
way too much and so again under existing
law

05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:23:00.628 --> 05:23:00.638 align:start position:0%
not even not only for these 13 offenses
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
but for any offense incl you know any
 
05:23:04.628 --> 05:23:04.638 align:start position:0%
offense if the person is determined to
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
be a danger they can be held and again
 
05:23:09.350 --> 05:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
we've been shown no data to show that
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
that is a problem that that's
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and if if it's a question
 
05:23:14.230 --> 05:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
of you know making sure that we have
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
more judges more bail commissioners
 
05:23:17.830 --> 05:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
better educational bill commissioners
 
05:23:19.030 --> 05:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
those are all things that we should
 
05:23:21.270 --> 05:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
consider but again going back to the
 
05:23:23.510 --> 05:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
data you know we are talking about going
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
down a road that you know research paper
 
05:23:29.190 --> 05:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
after research you know data-driven um
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
reports after data-driven reports have
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
shown is the worst option that we could
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
take as a society
 
05:23:36.628 --> 05:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
and again we should be focused on on
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
community supports that are actually
 
05:23:40.230 --> 05:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to address the underlying causes
 
05:23:42.628 --> 05:23:42.638 align:start position:0%
of of crime
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
if i could just ask a follow-up
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking is as opposed to if a
 
05:23:48.948 --> 05:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
person commits one of the 13 offenses
 
05:23:48.958 --> 05:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
person commits one of the 13 offenses
listed

05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
listed
 
05:23:52.548 --> 05:23:52.558 align:start position:0%
rather than that person be
 
05:23:54.868 --> 05:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
brought before any bail commissioner
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
if they were brought just before a judge
 
05:23:58.628 --> 05:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
i mean this that policy alone is there
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
any objection to that policy
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean they're going to be held
 
05:24:04.230 --> 05:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know pending in pre-trial detention
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
they just held pending their arraignment
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
which is would be within 24 to 36 hours
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
obviously excluding the
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
weekends and holiday issues so we don't
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a concern if they're
 
05:24:15.990 --> 05:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
brought you know as long as they're
 
05:24:18.070 --> 05:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
brought promptly but i think our concern
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
is that 24 to 36 hours when you add in
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
weekends you add in holidays that is
 
05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
multiple days that people would be away
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
from their families away from their jobs
 
05:24:27.990 --> 05:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
away from their daily responsibilities
 
05:24:29.830 --> 05:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
and again this is just based off of a
 
05:24:29.840 --> 05:24:30.948 align:start position:0%
and again this is just based off of a
charge

05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
charge
 
05:24:32.708 --> 05:24:32.718 align:start position:0%
and so ensuring that those people can
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
get before someone immediately to
 
05:24:36.470 --> 05:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they are danger
 
05:24:38.070 --> 05:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
we think is the best approach and that's
 
05:24:40.230 --> 05:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
the approach that data
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative schultz thank you mr
 
05:24:47.920 --> 05:24:49.030 align:start position:0%
representative schultz thank you mr
chair

05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:24:50.948 --> 05:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of your testimony you
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this bill
 
05:24:54.718 --> 05:24:55.510 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this bill
uh

05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:24:57.270 --> 05:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
you stated that this bill would
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
essentially be less safe
 
05:25:01.270 --> 05:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
for our communities
 
05:25:04.470 --> 05:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
so am i hearing you correctly that a
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
social safety net through our judicial
 
05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
system rather than those with the proper
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
training on
 
05:25:14.470 --> 05:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
substance misuse
 
05:25:17.830 --> 05:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
housing for all is a more expensive and
 
05:25:17.840 --> 05:25:18.868 align:start position:0%
housing for all is a more expensive and
less

05:25:18.868 --> 05:25:18.878 align:start position:0%
less
 
05:25:18.878 --> 05:25:20.548 align:start position:0%
less
safe

05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
safe
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
system that is very expensive as well
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
like the wrong the wrong approach as a
 
05:25:25.120 --> 05:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
like the wrong the wrong approach as a
society

05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
to our um
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
social safety net
 
05:25:31.110 --> 05:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i think if you actually if you look
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
at research on carson approaches to
 
05:25:34.868 --> 05:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
public safety the research is pretty
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
clear that those were very limited
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
exceptions is the worst way we could go
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
as a society and again if you look at
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
social science it's fairly clear that if
 
05:25:45.510 --> 05:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
you actually invest in housing supports
 
05:25:47.270 --> 05:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's a correlation between access to
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
housing and reductions in crime rates
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's a correlation between living
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
wage access and reduction in crime
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
weights and so if we as a society are
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
really concerned about public safety we
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
should look at where the social science
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
shows us we should be investing and
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
prioritizing those those programs and
 
05:26:05.590 --> 05:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
again or also with with mental health
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
supports you know the star program i
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned in denver cahoots out in
 
05:26:08.798 --> 05:26:10.548 align:start position:0%
mentioned in denver cahoots out in
eugene

05:26:10.548 --> 05:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
eugene
 
05:26:13.830 --> 05:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
are our data-driven programs that
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
are making those communities safer and
 
05:26:17.830 --> 05:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
saving lots of tax dollars at the same
 
05:26:17.840 --> 05:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
saving lots of tax dollars at the same
time

05:26:19.110 --> 05:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:26:21.190 --> 05:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:23.190 --> 05:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
if i may inquire with the question i
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
understand the point of maybe being
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
preemptive in dealing with housing and
 
05:26:28.708 --> 05:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
mental health issues
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's gonna happen
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
overnight so
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
is there any reason why
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
why not do both
 
05:26:38.150 --> 05:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think the reason we wouldn't want to
 
05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
do both is if you look at the research
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know as the most recent one from
 
05:26:44.548 --> 05:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
arnold ventures found jailing someone
 
05:26:47.030 --> 05:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
for as little as 24 hours actually has a
 
05:26:49.270 --> 05:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
public safety harm connected with it
 
05:26:51.030 --> 05:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
that those people are more likely to
 
05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
commit a future crime because they're
 
05:26:54.390 --> 05:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
being pulled away from their community
 
05:26:56.628 --> 05:26:56.638 align:start position:0%
and so if we have immediate dollars to
 
05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
invest in something like this which is
 
05:27:00.070 --> 05:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to cost millions of dollars we'd
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
be much better off investing those
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
dollars into community supports and
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
ensuring that people are getting the
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%

05:27:17.110 --> 05:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
that there is a saying
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
um that is it's friday avoid the
 
05:27:19.760 --> 05:27:21.990 align:start position:0%
um that is it's friday avoid the
bookings

05:27:21.990 --> 05:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
bookings
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
i had not heard that but um it makes
 
05:27:31.990 --> 05:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:33.270 --> 05:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%

05:28:27.030 --> 05:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you for the
 
05:28:30.948 --> 05:28:30.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today my name is
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
ophelia burnett i'm a manchester
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
resident and i am the healing justice
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
organizer intern with american friends
 
05:28:38.548 --> 05:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
service committee
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
i am here today in opposition of
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
sb 294 so we all know the saying
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty but with
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation sb 294 it really
 
05:28:54.150 --> 05:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
changes that whole concept to guilty
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
until proven innocent
 
05:28:56.000 --> 05:28:56.948 align:start position:0%
until proven innocent
why

05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation takes away granite
 
05:29:01.110 --> 05:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
stater's opportunity to see a bail
 
05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner this presents the
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
individual for making bail which then
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
mandate 72-hour period of incarceration
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
before seeing a judge
 
05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
there will be a ripple effects from
 
05:29:15.030 --> 05:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
which this brings terrible consequences
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
we all have jobs that our households
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
depend on with these individuals being
 
05:29:22.470 --> 05:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
held up to 72 hours their jobs are now
 
05:29:25.430 --> 05:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
at risk and this can lead to termination
 
05:29:27.190 --> 05:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have been so dependent on our cell
 
05:29:29.590 --> 05:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
phones for so long that while being held
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
are unable to remember numbers to call
 
05:29:35.190 --> 05:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
their jobs to let them know they will be
 
05:29:36.788 --> 05:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
out for a couple days
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
even if they could remember a number
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
when first arriving at the doc you were
 
05:29:43.430 --> 05:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
only able to make collect calls
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the workplace is not taking
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
collect calls from the jail and i'm sure
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
no one wants to even take
 
05:29:52.390 --> 05:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
any collect calls from a jail
 
05:29:54.390 --> 05:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry and i'm sure no one wants to
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
even make those kind of calls to their
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
employer so there goes their job
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
and then that leads to not being able to
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
pay bills rent etc now we have
 
05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
individuals getting evicted and possibly
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
being homeless
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
then here we are
 
05:30:12.070 --> 05:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
going adding to already growing homeless
 
05:30:14.230 --> 05:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
epidemics here in the granite state and
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be back here on a different date
 
05:30:18.310 --> 05:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
talking about another issue we have
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
going on and have to fix
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
so are we really trying to heal and
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
better our community or are we trying to
 
05:30:26.788 --> 05:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
make things harder for people of our
 
05:30:28.788 --> 05:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
community to elevate and crawl out of
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
failing systems
 
05:30:33.190 --> 05:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
i know that as members of this committee
 
05:30:35.030 --> 05:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
you are trying to make decisions for the
 
05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
good of our communities and state as a
 
05:30:40.628 --> 05:30:40.638 align:start position:0%
whole while sb 294 will not help us
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
this legislation expands the
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
criminalization of poverty current law
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
says that judges must consider an
 
05:30:49.350 --> 05:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
individual's income and their ability to
 
05:30:51.990 --> 05:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
pay when settling bail when setting bail
 
05:30:54.310 --> 05:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me current law also creates
 
05:30:56.230 --> 05:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
mechanisms so that individuals can be
 
05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
detained if they're posed if they pose a
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
danger to their community
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
sb 294 partly undoes this important
 
05:31:05.830 --> 05:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
reform and allows the incarceration of
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
individuals simply because they cannot
 
05:31:09.990 --> 05:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
afford bill
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire must ensure the people
 
05:31:14.708 --> 05:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
that justice systems work for all of us
 
05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
and not just according to our financial
 
05:31:16.718 --> 05:31:17.830 align:start position:0%
and not just according to our financial
status

05:31:17.830 --> 05:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
status
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
this legislation also over incarcerates
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
individuals pretrial because it
 
05:31:25.190 --> 05:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
determines who remains free
 
05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
pre-trial by crime and not
 
05:31:29.030 --> 05:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
individualized situations
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
sb 294 will incarcerate those who are
 
05:31:33.910 --> 05:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
not dangerous those who are not at
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
flight risk those who will have charges
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
dismissed and those who would not who
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
would be found not guilty it makes me
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
think about a time almost two decades
 
05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
ago when i was a teen and had a run in
 
05:31:47.670 --> 05:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
with the law i was young hanging with
 
05:31:50.310 --> 05:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
the wrong crowd wrong place wrong time
 
05:31:52.628 --> 05:31:52.638 align:start position:0%
and i got inc i got arrested
 
05:31:53.910 --> 05:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know what
 
05:31:55.750 --> 05:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
bail reform bills were in place at the
 
05:31:55.760 --> 05:31:56.868 align:start position:0%
bail reform bills were in place at the
time

05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
but i know i did not see a bail a bail
 
05:31:59.040 --> 05:32:00.548 align:start position:0%
but i know i did not see a bail a bail
commissioner

05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
05:32:02.868 --> 05:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
when i had my arraignment i was told i
 
05:32:06.628 --> 05:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
had to post a 200 000 cash bail
 
05:32:09.590 --> 05:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
cash bail i didn't kill anyone
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
i was fresh out of high school most
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
popular no priors i was so distraught my
 
05:32:17.430 --> 05:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
mother was devastated so i'm held at
 
05:32:19.590 --> 05:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
valley street jail for a month trying to
 
05:32:22.150 --> 05:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
get my bail reduced i mean two hundred
 
05:32:24.390 --> 05:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars cash who has that kind
 
05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
of money laying around
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
my request to lower my bail was denied
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
so i waited at valley street for over 18
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
months i was 19 years old and i'm
 
05:32:35.670 --> 05:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
literally fighting for my life
 
05:32:36.948 --> 05:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
being young
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
not knowing the system my mom being
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
elderly and sickly at the time from the
 
05:32:43.350 --> 05:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
agony of what was going on with me she
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have the funds to get that kind
 
05:32:47.670 --> 05:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
of a lawyer i needed from my situation i
 
05:32:50.070 --> 05:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
was told that if i went to trial and
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
lost i can do prison time
 
05:32:55.430 --> 05:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
for seven and a half to 15 years but if
 
05:32:57.750 --> 05:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
i took a plea after already serving
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
almost a year and a half i would only
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
have to serve another two and a half of
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
course being young scared and naive and
 
05:33:07.590 --> 05:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to get out of that hell hole so
 
05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
badly i took the plea
 
05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
and with this legislation sb 294 will
 
05:33:15.190 --> 05:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
put people and fair and scared
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
individuals to making the choice like i
 
05:33:17.680 --> 05:33:18.470 align:start position:0%
individuals to making the choice like i
did

05:33:18.470 --> 05:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
about two weeks ago i sat in the senate
 
05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on hp 1476
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
and two police officers stated that
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
people only talk and think about the
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
people who commit these crimes and never
 
05:33:32.390 --> 05:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
the victims but with this legislation
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
like sb 294 you are making more victims
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
making more victims of this revolving
 
05:33:40.470 --> 05:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
cycle in this justice system
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
i tell my story to say these kind of
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
proposals don't help situations or
 
05:33:48.628 --> 05:33:48.638 align:start position:0%
better our community in my opinion they
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
cause more pain and harm
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.510 --> 05:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
it took years of mental health
 
05:34:04.230 --> 05:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
counseling medication and my strong
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
family and my friends acting as a
 
05:34:08.150 --> 05:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
support system
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
to get
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
right here where i am sitting today to
 
05:34:13.350 --> 05:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
tell my story
 
05:34:15.670 --> 05:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
but not everyone has a support system or
 
05:34:18.628 --> 05:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
the strong mindset i had which is why i
 
05:34:20.708 --> 05:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
sit here as a voice for those who don't
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
have a chance or voice to sit up here
 
05:34:27.110 --> 05:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
and say bills like sb 294 should be
 
05:34:27.120 --> 05:34:28.230 align:start position:0%
and say bills like sb 294 should be
opposed

05:34:28.230 --> 05:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
05:34:30.070 --> 05:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
let's find better solutions to our
 
05:34:32.868 --> 05:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
problems like substance misuse treatment
 
05:34:32.878 --> 05:34:33.990 align:start position:0%
problems like substance misuse treatment
programs

05:34:33.990 --> 05:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:34:36.070 --> 05:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
mental health facilities and getting to
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
the root why individuals are doing the
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
things they do
 
05:34:41.590 --> 05:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
putting people behind walls and throwing
 
05:34:44.070 --> 05:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
away the key is not the solution
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%

come here and tell your story to benefit
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
others i hope you don't mind that that
 
05:35:01.510 --> 05:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
was just
 
05:35:03.670 --> 05:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
i could tell that that was an emotional
 
05:35:05.430 --> 05:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
testimony for you so i just wanted to
 
05:35:07.510 --> 05:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that thank you it wasn't a
 
05:35:11.110 --> 05:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:17.830 --> 05:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do you
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
feel that you were wrongly charged and
 
05:35:22.150 --> 05:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
did time for that
 
05:35:24.708 --> 05:35:24.718 align:start position:0%
for doing nothing
 
05:35:27.350 --> 05:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
yes i do think i was
 
05:35:29.990 --> 05:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:38.548 --> 05:35:38.558 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
05:35:41.990 --> 05:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
if it's not too presumptuous what was
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying charge for you
 
05:35:49.270 --> 05:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
really i just wanted to make sure that
 
05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
the witness knows she doesn't have to
 
05:35:56.708 --> 05:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
answer that question just oh okay
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:02.390 --> 05:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
when a point of order is raised
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
the first thing i need to do is
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
address the point point of order so
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
represent calling please state your
 
05:36:09.270 --> 05:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
05:36:10.788 --> 05:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i withdraw the point of
 
05:36:10.798 --> 05:36:20.390 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i withdraw the point of
order

05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.150 --> 05:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
if you would draw the point of order the
 
05:36:23.590 --> 05:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative would be
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
potentially be committed to
 
05:36:28.868 --> 05:36:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's an issue of decorum i'm just
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
two years into this term
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
i just was attempting to to let the
 
05:36:37.030 --> 05:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
witness know that there may be a
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
sensitive question that she didn't have
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
there was no other uh immediate tool
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
that came to mind so i said point of
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
order if that was wrong i really
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
05:36:48.708 --> 05:36:48.718 align:start position:0%
i understand and just
 
05:36:50.788 --> 05:36:50.798 align:start position:0%
to the witness if there is and this goes
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to anyone uh here if questions asked by
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
a member to the witness and
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
the member of the public is not
 
05:36:57.510 --> 05:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable answering the question it's
 
05:36:58.948 --> 05:36:58.958 align:start position:0%
not like a courtroom where you must you
 
05:37:00.390 --> 05:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
know i can't order you to answer the
 
05:37:00.400 --> 05:37:01.430 align:start position:0%
know i can't order you to answer the
question

05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:37:03.830 --> 05:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
so if and i would hope the members would
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
try to be respectful and ask questions
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
that i'm not saying that the
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative manchester was doing
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
anything intentional or not but just i
 
05:37:17.190 --> 05:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%

05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
not a hundred percent but the majority
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
of this is a manchester problem that
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're having
 
05:37:33.280 --> 05:37:34.548 align:start position:0%
they're having
how

05:37:34.548 --> 05:37:34.558 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:37:38.230 --> 05:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
could we fix this without passing laws
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:42.558 --> 05:37:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%

05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
really feel like we
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
um as like i was saying i feel like we
 
05:37:55.830 --> 05:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
should be really working on the roots of
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
the issues on why people are doing the
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
things that they're doing i don't feel
 
05:37:59.760 --> 05:38:00.628 align:start position:0%
things that they're doing i don't feel
like

05:38:00.628 --> 05:38:00.638 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:38:02.548 --> 05:38:02.558 align:start position:0%
putting people in prison is what's going
 
05:38:04.150 --> 05:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
to help
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
these issues i feel like you know people
 
05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
are doing some things because of things
 
05:38:10.070 --> 05:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
they've went through as a child
 
05:38:11.830 --> 05:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues and things like
 
05:38:13.350 --> 05:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
that and i feel like if we take care of
 
05:38:15.670 --> 05:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
those underlying issues we can stop a
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the crimes that are being taken
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:23.750 --> 05:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative bert you recognize for a
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you mr chairman
 
05:38:26.000 --> 05:38:28.230 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you mr chairman
and

05:38:28.230 --> 05:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:30.868 --> 05:38:30.878 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming you're out in the public
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know seeing this yes i am thank you
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
know what the average
 
05:38:40.470 --> 05:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
education is of people that are you know
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
sadly in this position that are are
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
05:38:47.590 --> 05:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
i can't say that i do
 
05:38:50.390 --> 05:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
um i know that i'm actually going to
 
05:38:52.628 --> 05:38:52.638 align:start position:0%
school to be a lawyer myself so that i
 
05:38:55.270 --> 05:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
can be aware of what's going on and be
 
05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable to things like that
 
05:38:59.270 --> 05:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
but for everybody else i can't speak for
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
them all right thank you
 
05:39:03.910 --> 05:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
05:39:07.510 --> 05:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and and
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
sharing your experience um
 
05:39:14.070 --> 05:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
would you say that the experience you
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
had is unique or have you heard of other
 
05:39:17.360 --> 05:39:18.548 align:start position:0%
had is unique or have you heard of other
cases

05:39:18.548 --> 05:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
cases
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
similar to yours
 
05:39:23.830 --> 05:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
um i think everybody's story is unique
 
05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
um everybody has their own story to tell
 
05:39:29.190 --> 05:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
every individual does
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
i feel like mike
 
05:39:34.230 --> 05:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
i don't really want to get into it too
 
05:39:36.150 --> 05:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
much i just feel like my case could have
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
definitely been
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
dealt with um
 
05:39:41.590 --> 05:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
in a different manner
 
05:39:44.470 --> 05:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i feel because of that
 
05:39:46.628 --> 05:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say unfortunate but
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
fortunately it made me the person i am
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
today it took a lot of things away from
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
me but i do feel like the justice system
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
kind of failed me and it took a lot of
 
05:39:57.910 --> 05:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
things away from me but like i said it
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
made me who i am today and i'm a lot
 
05:39:59.520 --> 05:40:00.548 align:start position:0%
made me who i am today and i'm a lot
stronger

05:40:00.548 --> 05:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
but things could have been could have
 
05:40:05.830 --> 05:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:07.430 --> 05:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
representing muse you recognize for a
 
05:40:07.440 --> 05:40:09.270 align:start position:0%
representing muse you recognize for a
follow-up

05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
would you agree that your case points
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
out that there is an other side to some
 
05:40:18.230 --> 05:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:20.548 --> 05:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
can you re
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
may rephrase the question yeah rephrase
 
05:40:23.430 --> 05:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
that please yes would you would you
 
05:40:25.670 --> 05:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
would you agree that um
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
that your case points out
 
05:40:27.840 --> 05:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
that your case points out
that

05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
a different aspect to some of the
 
05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
anecdotes we hear a lot of the anecdotes
 
05:40:36.150 --> 05:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
that we hear
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
are worst case scenarios from a victim
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint your
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
your case appears to be almost a worst
 
05:40:44.150 --> 05:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
case scenario from the standpoint of
 
05:40:46.628 --> 05:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
somebody who's accused of a crime
 
05:40:46.638 --> 05:40:48.070 align:start position:0%
somebody who's accused of a crime
well

05:40:48.070 --> 05:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:40:49.910 --> 05:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know i feel like as far as like the
 
05:40:52.230 --> 05:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
bail you know i didn't get a chance to
 
05:40:54.868 --> 05:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
they gave me such a high bail for for
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
instance i couldn't even get out and and
 
05:40:59.430 --> 05:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
fight on the outside and be with my
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
family i was snatched
 
05:41:01.200 --> 05:41:02.470 align:start position:0%
family i was snatched
from

05:41:02.470 --> 05:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:41:05.670 --> 05:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
my family immediately um they made it so
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
high that
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
i don't even know who unless you were
 
05:41:11.430 --> 05:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
famous or rich can pay a 200 000 cash
 
05:41:13.750 --> 05:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
bail so that traumatized me i thought
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
that i was going home once they told me
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
i was going to have a bail hearing i
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
thought they would at least lower it i
 
05:41:20.948 --> 05:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
didn't kill anyone i never had any
 
05:41:23.430 --> 05:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
priors like i said in my testimony so
 
05:41:25.670 --> 05:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
once i went to my bail hearing and i
 
05:41:27.750 --> 05:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
didn't get my bail lowered that was
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
another traumatizing situation for me
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
after already being snatched away from
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
my family so
 
05:41:36.310 --> 05:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
it was very unfortunate so
 
05:41:36.320 --> 05:41:39.510 align:start position:0%
it was very unfortunate so
yeah

05:41:39.510 --> 05:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.830 --> 05:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:41:43.840 --> 05:41:45.030 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
questions

05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:41:46.708 --> 05:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh you say in your testimony that you
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
didn't see a
 
05:41:52.628 --> 05:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
if you would respond as much as you
 
05:41:57.030 --> 05:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
think you should respond
 
05:41:58.230 --> 05:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:42:01.350 --> 05:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
was it business hours was it after hours
 
05:42:02.868 --> 05:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
that you were arrested was there a
 
05:42:04.230 --> 05:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
reason why you didn't see a bail
 
05:42:05.510 --> 05:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner just just what your
 
05:42:07.430 --> 05:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
experience was like
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
of being arrested and not seeing a bail
 
05:42:11.910 --> 05:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
hearing a commissioner and then
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to a bail hearing which i assume
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
was in front of a judge and if you don't
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
want to respond to that that's fine no
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative i don't know like how
 
05:42:24.150 --> 05:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know some of these bills are now
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
like when you come in uh when you get
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
arrested you can't see a bail
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner depending on your charge or
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
you have to wait a certain amount of
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
hours and things like that but i do
 
05:42:33.600 --> 05:42:34.548 align:start position:0%
hours and things like that but i do
remember

05:42:34.548 --> 05:42:34.558 align:start position:0%
remember
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
when i got arrested i didn't see a bail
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner i know um like mostly in
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
all cases you go to your arraignment on
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
the next day which i did they
 
05:42:47.110 --> 05:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
they made my bail at two hundred
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars cash and then usually a
 
05:42:53.190 --> 05:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
month later they let you have your um
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
your bail hearing and that's when i went
 
05:42:56.470 --> 05:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
and they said they were not lowering my
 
05:42:57.990 --> 05:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
bail they were keeping at two hundred
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:10.548 --> 05:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:11.590 --> 05:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna thank the witness for her
 
05:43:11.600 --> 05:43:12.868 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna thank the witness for her
testimony

05:43:12.868 --> 05:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:43:16.150 --> 05:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls jeff wood from
 
05:43:37.510 --> 05:43:37.520 align:start position:0%

05:44:01.510 --> 05:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
but here really to provide uh what i'll
 
05:44:05.910 --> 05:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
call some technical feedback with
 
05:44:07.590 --> 05:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
respect to this bill
 
05:44:07.600 --> 05:44:08.788 align:start position:0%
respect to this bill
um

05:44:08.788 --> 05:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:10.310 --> 05:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
my office i think we are
 
05:44:12.070 --> 05:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
again generally supportive of what the
 
05:44:14.070 --> 05:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
um what the bill is attending to
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
accomplish and happy to
 
05:44:17.510 --> 05:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
answer any broader questions but there
 
05:44:18.628 --> 05:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
are a few
 
05:44:20.390 --> 05:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
i think again technical issues that i
 
05:44:22.788 --> 05:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
think are important um with respect to
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:44:26.310 --> 05:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
if it is passed by by the committee and
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
by the house
 
05:44:27.760 --> 05:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
by the house
um

05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:30.788 --> 05:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
and they speak to some of the work uh
 
05:44:32.708 --> 05:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
that my office does in particular in the
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
criminal bureau we handle is as i think
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
many of the members of the committee are
 
05:44:35.680 --> 05:44:36.548 align:start position:0%
many of the members of the committee are
aware

05:44:36.548 --> 05:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
aware
 
05:44:40.230 --> 05:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
of the homicide cases statewide
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
or excuse me all the murder cases
 
05:44:41.760 --> 05:44:42.868 align:start position:0%
or excuse me all the murder cases
statewide

05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
and on if i'm looking at the right
 
05:44:47.510 --> 05:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
version on page 2
 
05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me page 1
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
that section in terms of listing the
 
05:44:56.548 --> 05:44:56.558 align:start position:0%
enumerated crimes
 
05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh that are addressed uh under the
 
05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
72-hour initial hold uh again up to
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
72-hour initial hold i think that's
 
05:45:06.150 --> 05:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
worth pointing out and i'm happy to
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
discuss that in more detail
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
but the
 
05:45:10.708 --> 05:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
read the person who is charged with
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
homicide under rsa 630 colon 1.
 
05:45:16.708 --> 05:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
rsa 630 colon 1 is not the crime of
 
05:45:20.708 --> 05:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
homicide rsa 6 colon 30 rsa 630 colon 1
 
05:45:22.868 --> 05:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
is the crime of capital murder
 
05:45:25.110 --> 05:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
so if the bill is intended to cover all
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
homicide crimes it should simply say rsa
 
05:45:27.600 --> 05:45:29.830 align:start position:0%
homicide crimes it should simply say rsa
630.

05:45:29.830 --> 05:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
630.
 
05:45:31.270 --> 05:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
in addition i think it's important for
 
05:45:34.470 --> 05:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to be aware that the
 
05:45:36.470 --> 05:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's currently again speaking
 
05:45:38.788 --> 05:45:38.798 align:start position:0%
specific as to homicide crimes or crimes
 
05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
that are punishable by up to life
 
05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
imprisonment which can be some
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense crimes
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh there is already a bail provision
 
05:45:47.350 --> 05:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
that deals with
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
those circumstances it's rsa 5971c
 
05:45:51.948 --> 05:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
and what
 
05:45:51.958 --> 05:45:53.590 align:start position:0%
and what
rsa5971c

05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
rsa5971c
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
says is that those individuals that are
 
05:45:56.948 --> 05:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
charged with crimes uh that are
 
05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
punishable by up to life imprisonment
 
05:46:00.868 --> 05:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
again something we often deal with with
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
murder cases that we handle those
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
individuals shall not be allowed bail so
 
05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
long as the proof is evident and or the
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
presumption great and so there's a
 
05:46:10.948 --> 05:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
there's a presumption there that those
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
folks aren't going to get bail at all
 
05:46:14.948 --> 05:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
not that they'll be held for 72 hours
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
and then have a bail hearing um and not
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
that there's a rebuttable presumption
 
05:46:19.990 --> 05:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
but that they will not get bail and
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's been the state of the law since
 
05:46:24.670 --> 05:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
uh 1993 was when
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
rsa5971c was passed
 
05:46:28.948 --> 05:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
so the last time this came around senate
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
bill 92 it was our recommendation that
 
05:46:33.030 --> 05:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
the statute should read or that the bill
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
should read again on line 25
 
05:46:41.350 --> 05:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
that except is provided for an rsa 5971c
 
05:46:43.670 --> 05:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
a person who is charged with homicide
 
05:46:45.270 --> 05:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
under rsa again
 
05:46:45.280 --> 05:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
under rsa again
30

05:46:47.030 --> 05:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
30
 
05:46:48.868 --> 05:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
and and so on and so forth as the
 
05:46:50.948 --> 05:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
language reads that would acknowledge
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
that for murder crimes first-degree
 
05:46:54.310 --> 05:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
murder second-degree murder capital
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
murder there's a separate bail provision
 
05:46:58.948 --> 05:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
that deals with those offenses um and
 
05:47:00.628 --> 05:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
and what the standards are in terms of
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
holding people without bail who are
 
05:47:04.310 --> 05:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
charged with those crimes and would also
 
05:47:06.470 --> 05:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
make clear uh that this is intended to
 
05:47:09.270 --> 05:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
apply to all homicide crimes
 
05:47:11.350 --> 05:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
manslaughter negligent homicide as well
 
05:47:12.788 --> 05:47:12.798 align:start position:0%
and those may be cases where someone
 
05:47:15.030 --> 05:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
could be entitled to bail
 
05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
under this statute
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to provide
 
05:47:21.750 --> 05:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
written language with respect to that to
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
the committee if that
 
05:47:25.030 --> 05:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
as opposed to
 
05:47:26.470 --> 05:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
expecting that you'd be able to follow
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
along necessarily with it
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
i will point out as well with respect to
 
05:47:34.948 --> 05:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
the 72-hour provision in this bill
 
05:47:36.230 --> 05:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
are already in place court rules
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
concerning the timing of an arraignment
 
05:47:41.670 --> 05:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
if someone has been detained following
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
their arrest
 
05:47:45.030 --> 05:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire rule of criminal procedure
 
05:47:46.948 --> 05:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
4 which deals with initial proceedings
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
in circuit court the new hampshire rule
 
05:47:50.708 --> 05:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
of criminal procedure 10 which deals
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
with arraignment
 
05:47:54.310 --> 05:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
in superior court
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
speaks to how long someone can be held
 
05:47:56.240 --> 05:47:57.830 align:start position:0%
speaks to how long someone can be held
uh

05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:48:00.628 --> 05:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
and before they are brought uh before
 
05:48:03.270 --> 05:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
the court for arraignment and it's it's
 
05:48:04.868 --> 05:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
not that the timelines are different
 
05:48:06.310 --> 05:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's just put differently and i might
 
05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
recommend that this committee uh take a
 
05:48:10.150 --> 05:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
look at that language and bring this
 
05:48:12.548 --> 05:48:12.558 align:start position:0%
bill into compliance uh or make it
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
consistent with this the current
 
05:48:17.350 --> 05:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
court rules both in circuit court and in
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh superior court with respect to uh the
 
05:48:22.548 --> 05:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
timing of arraignment
 
05:48:22.558 --> 05:48:24.070 align:start position:0%
timing of arraignment
um

05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
beyond that uh
 
05:48:27.430 --> 05:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
those issues um
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we spotted and wanted to make sure
 
05:48:31.350 --> 05:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
got corrected i'm happy to take any
 
05:48:33.750 --> 05:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions on on the bill in general or
 
05:48:35.750 --> 05:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
those specific issues although i know
 
05:48:37.110 --> 05:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
there are folks from the law enforcement
 
05:48:38.708 --> 05:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
community here who will provide better
 
05:48:40.150 --> 05:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
information than i'm able to with
 
05:48:41.830 --> 05:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
respect to how this has impacted the
 
05:48:43.670 --> 05:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations of their
 
05:48:43.680 --> 05:48:45.510 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations of their
departments

05:48:45.510 --> 05:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
departments
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and if the
 
05:48:50.230 --> 05:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
chair may inquire with the question
 
05:48:52.470 --> 05:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
in in respect to the
 
05:48:54.470 --> 05:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment 2 1
 
05:48:57.750 --> 05:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
8 0 h that was
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
that applied to senate bill 92
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
did that address the concerns of making
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
making the
 
05:49:06.628 --> 05:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
policy proposal consistent with the
 
05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
court rules
 
05:49:11.030 --> 05:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's as i recall and i apologize mr
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
chair i don't believe i still have that
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
particular amendment with me but as i
 
05:49:17.190 --> 05:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
recall sorry what did you say the number
 
05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
was it again
 
05:49:22.230 --> 05:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
it was amendment number 21808
 
05:49:24.628 --> 05:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
okay no that's a different one um but as
 
05:49:27.590 --> 05:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
i recall again having worked
 
05:49:29.430 --> 05:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
with you and senator bradley on this
 
05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
last time around um i believe brought it
 
05:49:34.948 --> 05:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
into compliance with those court rules
 
05:49:36.628 --> 05:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
it was my recollection anyway without
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
having it in front of me my apologies
 
05:49:41.030 --> 05:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
but the language from those court rules
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:48.390 --> 05:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
taken before the superior court no later
 
05:49:50.070 --> 05:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
than 24 hours after the arrest saturday
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
sundays and holidays accepted or no
 
05:49:54.708 --> 05:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
later than 36 hours after arrest if
 
05:49:56.948 --> 05:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
arrested between 8 am and 1 pm and the
 
05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
person's attorney is unable to attend an
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
arraignment etc etc
 
05:50:03.670 --> 05:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
um and so so long as that's
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
similar to the language you're talking
 
05:50:07.030 --> 05:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
about and i and i think it i think it
 
05:50:07.040 --> 05:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
about and i and i think it i think it
was

05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
then that would bring it into compliance
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
with the court rule
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and the courts regularly
 
05:50:14.628 --> 05:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
the courts obviously are not open on
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
saturdays and sundays or on holidays but
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
if there are arrests over the weekend
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
that 24-hour rule brings folks in for
 
05:50:23.990 --> 05:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
arraignments usually in the afternoon of
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
the first day after the arrest if
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
they're arrested too late in the day
 
05:50:28.150 --> 05:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be arraigned until
 
05:50:31.190 --> 05:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
the following day
 
05:50:33.670 --> 05:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
for coming today
 
05:50:41.910 --> 05:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing rumors that
 
05:50:45.030 --> 05:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to next year
 
05:50:48.150 --> 05:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
come up with a magistrate system
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
and if that happened would senate bill
 
05:50:53.190 --> 05:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
294 be needed
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
if we had a magistrate where they could
 
05:50:55.680 --> 05:50:56.788 align:start position:0%
if we had a magistrate where they could
see

05:50:56.788 --> 05:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
you know any time of the day
 
05:51:01.990 --> 05:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
in weekends you know see these people to
 
05:51:05.670 --> 05:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:07.910 --> 05:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a rumor i hadn't heard um and
 
05:51:10.230 --> 05:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
i and i i think i would
 
05:51:12.470 --> 05:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
hesitate to answer that not knowing how
 
05:51:14.390 --> 05:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
that system would work
 
05:51:14.400 --> 05:51:15.430 align:start position:0%
that system would work
um

05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:16.868 --> 05:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
you know there
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
and there are certain crimes and i think
 
05:51:20.708 --> 05:51:20.718 align:start position:0%
what this makes makes clear and again
 
05:51:22.470 --> 05:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
with what we deal with with homicide
 
05:51:22.480 --> 05:51:23.590 align:start position:0%
with what we deal with with homicide
crimes

05:51:23.590 --> 05:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
05:51:25.868 --> 05:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
those ha and there's another provision
 
05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
rsa5974 that says
 
05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
in in a murder case
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
if there is going to be bail said it can
 
05:51:33.430 --> 05:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
only be set by a superior court justice
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
so depending on how that magistrate
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
system would work it it may or may not
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
deal with some of these issues but i
 
05:51:41.350 --> 05:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
think part of
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
the issue here is not
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily how long these these people
 
05:51:46.708 --> 05:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
are held because anyone who commits one
 
05:51:48.548 --> 05:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
of these enumerated crimes they're only
 
05:51:51.590 --> 05:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
held for up to 72 hours up to
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then they're allowed bail with a
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
with a rebuttable presumption so any of
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
these people charged with these crimes
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
can still get bail whether or not a
 
05:52:01.590 --> 05:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
magistrate could see them on the weekend
 
05:52:03.510 --> 05:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
um might not change whether or not they
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
were able to rebut that presumption or
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should be detained
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
which which is i understand the bill is
 
05:52:13.110 --> 05:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
is the aim here all right thank you
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative tessman thank you
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
05:52:19.270 --> 05:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
along the same lines
 
05:52:21.590 --> 05:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think this is discussed in one of
 
05:52:23.190 --> 05:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
our hearings before
 
05:52:23.200 --> 05:52:23.910 align:start position:0%
our hearings before
but

05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:52:26.230 --> 05:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
the issue seems to be
 
05:52:26.240 --> 05:52:29.190 align:start position:0%
the issue seems to be
the

05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
the lack of judges
 
05:52:32.160 --> 05:52:33.830 align:start position:0%
the lack of judges
or

05:52:33.830 --> 05:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't we solve all of these problems
 
05:52:40.230 --> 05:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
if we had enough judges on call 24 7
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know just to sign them
 
05:52:43.750 --> 05:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
superior court judge
 
05:52:45.750 --> 05:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know on a weekend you get the
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
calls you know if there's a call for
 
05:52:50.150 --> 05:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
bail and we get rid of all these bail
 
05:52:50.160 --> 05:52:53.990 align:start position:0%
bail and we get rid of all these bail
commissioners

05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
i think again what the what the
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
bill as i understand it is aimed at
 
05:53:01.350 --> 05:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
addressing is
 
05:53:03.190 --> 05:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
is whether or not
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
there should be a presumption that
 
05:53:06.868 --> 05:53:06.878 align:start position:0%
certain people are are danger to the
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
public and therefore should be held
 
05:53:10.470 --> 05:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
rather than than given bail and that
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
those are the folks charged with the
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
enumerated crimes in the section that i
 
05:53:15.270 --> 05:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
was just referencing those i believe
 
05:53:17.430 --> 05:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
someone has said 13 crimes
 
05:53:17.440 --> 05:53:18.548 align:start position:0%
someone has said 13 crimes
so

05:53:18.548 --> 05:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:20.070 --> 05:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't view this issue as a judge
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
availability issue certainly there are
 
05:53:23.350 --> 05:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners available but we're
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
talking about these these folks having a
 
05:53:27.430 --> 05:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
bail hearing in front of a judge
 
05:53:27.440 --> 05:53:28.708 align:start position:0%
bail hearing in front of a judge
um

05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't strike me as that it's a
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
weekend issue
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
no i i
 
05:53:35.990 --> 05:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
you misunderstood i'm saying we'll make
 
05:53:36.000 --> 05:53:36.708 align:start position:0%
you misunderstood i'm saying we'll make
a

05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:53:39.350 --> 05:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
judge available 24 hours a day seven
 
05:53:41.830 --> 05:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
days a week for even these kinds of
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
crimes and get rid of the bail
 
05:53:46.868 --> 05:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
commissioners just have these kind of
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.750 --> 05:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:59.910 --> 05:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
without this legislation i presume your
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
question is would that cure the problem
 
05:54:03.430 --> 05:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore not you wouldn't need this
 
05:54:05.670 --> 05:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and my answer to that would
 
05:54:07.750 --> 05:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
be based on my understanding of the goal
 
05:54:09.430 --> 05:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the legislation it's to make clear
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
that certain crimes
 
05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
because of the danger that they pose to
 
05:54:15.430 --> 05:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
society because they're victim crimes
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
because of the harm caused that we want
 
05:54:19.270 --> 05:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
there to be a presumption that these
 
05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
people are going to be
 
05:54:23.190 --> 05:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
potentially detained after a bail
 
05:54:24.628 --> 05:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
hearing so
 
05:54:24.638 --> 05:54:26.230 align:start position:0%
hearing so
this

05:54:26.230 --> 05:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
this carves out those crimes and so i
 
05:54:30.470 --> 05:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
think regardless of when the bail
 
05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
hearing occurred it still provides the
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
carve out and the statement by the
 
05:54:35.350 --> 05:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislature that these are dangerous
 
05:54:36.708 --> 05:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
crimes that
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
that there should be a rebuttable
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:45.750 --> 05:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:54:49.200 --> 05:54:51.430 align:start position:0%
my question
um

05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:54.548 --> 05:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
do these 13 serious crimes that are
 
05:54:56.390 --> 05:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
listed in the bill
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
have lesser included charges in them
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
that may be punishable only by a
 
05:55:03.910 --> 05:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor with no jail time or maybe
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
even a violation or do you have that
 
05:55:05.760 --> 05:55:07.750 align:start position:0%
even a violation or do you have that
knowledge

05:55:07.750 --> 05:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
so there are uh you know i believe it's
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
been pointed out with respect to
 
05:55:12.788 --> 05:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
stalking or domestic violence there are
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor variants of those crimes
 
05:55:18.070 --> 05:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's what you're
 
05:55:19.030 --> 05:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
asking is whether or not there are
 
05:55:21.430 --> 05:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor variants of the crimes
 
05:55:23.510 --> 05:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
and for so many of our crimes there are
 
05:55:25.990 --> 05:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
lesser included offenses potentially
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
that's usually something that only comes
 
05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
into play during the course of a jury
 
05:55:31.590 --> 05:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
trial and the instructions given to a
 
05:55:33.510 --> 05:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
jury as to what they can convict someone
 
05:55:33.520 --> 05:55:34.390 align:start position:0%
jury as to what they can convict someone
of

05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
the term lesser included
 
05:55:37.990 --> 05:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
but certainly there are misdemeanor
 
05:55:40.470 --> 05:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
variants of stalking and uh
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i think uh
 
05:55:44.230 --> 05:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
there was a reference to um
 
05:55:46.070 --> 05:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence crimes
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonious sexual assault
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
felonious sexual assault there's also a
 
05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor sexual assault but that's
 
05:55:53.430 --> 05:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
not listed here so again what you're
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with is what the initial crime
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
charged is
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
at this point and certainly if someone
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
as i think someone pointed out if
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
someone was charged with felonious
 
05:56:05.190 --> 05:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and a prosecutor chose to
 
05:56:06.788 --> 05:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
only go forward on a charge of sexual
 
05:56:08.310 --> 05:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
assault and that would change the bail
 
05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
represent newman you recognize for
 
05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
so if
 
05:56:22.070 --> 05:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
so if there are those lesser included
 
05:56:22.080 --> 05:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
so if there are those lesser included
crimes

05:56:23.510 --> 05:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
05:56:25.990 --> 05:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we've enumerated the ones that have
 
05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
that are felonies or greater
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
would this bill be improved by listing
 
05:56:35.030 --> 05:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
the lesser included crimes in there as
 
05:56:43.110 --> 05:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i guess i don't see how that would how
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
that would improve the bill because you
 
05:56:50.470 --> 05:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
have the enumerated crimes so including
 
05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
crime other crimes to say they're
 
05:56:54.230 --> 05:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
accepted i think every crime not listed
 
05:56:55.590 --> 05:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
is accepted
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
um from this list
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:57:00.470 --> 05:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
i think you would i think it would end
 
05:57:02.390 --> 05:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
up creating perhaps more confusion if
 
05:57:05.270 --> 05:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
you listed only a few that were accepted
 
05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
when based on this list every other
 
05:57:10.310 --> 05:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
crime in the criminal code is accepted
 
05:57:13.270 --> 05:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:15.190 --> 05:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
05:57:17.270 --> 05:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
05:57:17.280 --> 05:57:18.390 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
um

05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:20.310 --> 05:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
as as a prosecutor
 
05:57:22.708 --> 05:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
if you want a person who's accused of a
 
05:57:22.718 --> 05:57:23.830 align:start position:0%
if you want a person who's accused of a
crime

05:57:23.830 --> 05:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
held for dangerous dangerousness under
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
is that an easy thing for you to do is
 
05:57:34.390 --> 05:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
that a fairly simple court procedure
 
05:57:34.400 --> 05:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
that a fairly simple court procedure
uh

05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:38.070 --> 05:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's hard to answer that as a generality
 
05:57:40.708 --> 05:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's going to depend on the case
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
so you know to say that to have anybody
 
05:57:45.270 --> 05:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
held is an easy thing i think would be
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
an oversimplification of of the process
 
05:57:50.310 --> 05:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
um certainly not any number of factors
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
from the facts of the offense the
 
05:57:54.070 --> 05:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
offense charged
 
05:57:55.830 --> 05:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
that person's criminal history or lack
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
thereof um other other risks
 
05:58:01.270 --> 05:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
flight risk connections to the community
 
05:58:03.030 --> 05:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
or lack thereof
 
05:58:04.230 --> 05:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
all those sorts of things are going to
 
05:58:06.390 --> 05:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
come into play as to whether or not that
 
05:58:08.948 --> 05:58:08.958 align:start position:0%
person is held whether or not it's easy
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
to get someone held i would not say it's
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
easy to get someone held in the general
 
05:58:12.638 --> 05:58:14.548 align:start position:0%
easy to get someone held in the general
sense

05:58:14.548 --> 05:58:14.558 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:58:16.390 --> 05:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
absent those crimes that we deal with
 
05:58:18.310 --> 05:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
the murder crimes where it's automatic
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the first instance but that being
 
05:58:21.750 --> 05:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
said that can still be challenged and we
 
05:58:23.910 --> 05:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
have to have evidentiary hearings to
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
meet our burden to hold that individual
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
so it's certainly not an easy process um
 
05:58:32.070 --> 05:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
and and to be frank it shouldn't be um
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
in order to take someone's liberty away
 
05:58:37.910 --> 05:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
but there should be a recognition
 
05:58:40.310 --> 05:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
that certain crimes uh pose such a
 
05:58:42.708 --> 05:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
significant danger to the community uh
 
05:58:43.830 --> 05:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
that that there's going to be a
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
presumption that those folks can be held
 
05:58:46.628 --> 05:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
one that can be overcome but are
 
05:58:46.638 --> 05:58:50.310 align:start position:0%
one that can be overcome but are
presumption

05:58:50.310 --> 05:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
representative muse yes
 
05:58:59.750 --> 05:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i i guess another way to to phrase my
 
05:59:01.590 --> 05:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:59:03.750 --> 05:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be some disagreement
 
05:59:06.390 --> 05:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not sb 294 is actually
 
05:59:06.400 --> 05:59:07.590 align:start position:0%
whether or not sb 294 is actually
necessary

05:59:07.590 --> 05:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the current law
 
05:59:11.590 --> 05:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
allows people to be held for
 
05:59:11.600 --> 05:59:13.590 align:start position:0%
allows people to be held for
dangerousness

05:59:13.590 --> 05:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
 
05:59:13.600 --> 05:59:14.628 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
so

05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:17.110 --> 05:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm
 
05:59:20.150 --> 05:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
mulling over in my own head is
 
05:59:20.160 --> 05:59:21.270 align:start position:0%
mulling over in my own head is
what

05:59:21.270 --> 05:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:59:23.430 --> 05:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
are the advantages of the approach
 
05:59:23.440 --> 05:59:24.708 align:start position:0%
are the advantages of the approach
outlined

05:59:24.708 --> 05:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
outlined
 
05:59:24.718 --> 05:59:25.590 align:start position:0%
outlined
in

05:59:25.590 --> 05:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:59:29.270 --> 05:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
sb 294 over the current law
 
05:59:31.350 --> 05:59:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh where the x factor seems to be the
 
05:59:33.910 --> 05:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances and the judge you know
 
05:59:35.910 --> 05:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
that that the hearing would happen in
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
front of
 
05:59:39.270 --> 05:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
it would seem like the circumstances and
 
05:59:41.830 --> 05:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
the judge would continue to be variables
 
05:59:43.430 --> 05:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
under sb
 
05:59:45.350 --> 05:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
294 so
 
05:59:49.190 --> 05:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.948 --> 05:59:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know yeah you're correct in saying
 
05:59:52.868 --> 05:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
that the the the facts of a particular
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
case and the judge are always going to
 
05:59:57.430 --> 05:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
be uh going to be variables that are
 
05:59:58.948 --> 05:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
you know out of the control at least of
 
06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
of legislation you can't you can't
 
06:00:03.110 --> 06:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislate this to every single case um
 
06:00:05.830 --> 06:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
but what i again see is the point behind
 
06:00:09.190 --> 06:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is to is to provide
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
those judges the prosecutors defense
 
06:00:12.150 --> 06:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys with guidance under those
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
situations and the guidance is that
 
06:00:16.150 --> 06:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
these limited crimes
 
06:00:18.708 --> 06:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
um are are are ones where there should
 
06:00:20.310 --> 06:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
be a presumption that they should be
 
06:00:20.320 --> 06:00:21.430 align:start position:0%
be a presumption that they should be
detained

06:00:21.430 --> 06:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
detained
 
06:00:24.548 --> 06:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to it just being a a
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
an open question with respect to
 
06:00:29.190 --> 06:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
whatever crime is at issue is you're
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
providing a guide post
 
06:00:32.548 --> 06:00:32.558 align:start position:0%
to those judges
 
06:00:34.310 --> 06:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
under these circumstances you're saying
 
06:00:36.548 --> 06:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
look at these 13 crimes cases that
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
involve these 13 crimes serious crimes
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
crimes of the victims
 
06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
and uh and can that's that's correct
 
06:00:45.440 --> 06:00:46.548 align:start position:0%
and uh and can that's that's correct
so

06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:47.830 --> 06:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
please correct me if i'm wrong my
 
06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
question is if
 
06:00:52.390 --> 06:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
so assuming that obviously
 
06:00:54.708 --> 06:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
it's pretend it's not a leap year 365
 
06:00:54.718 --> 06:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
it's pretend it's not a leap year 365
days

06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
days
 
06:00:58.230 --> 06:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
exclude the weekends that's
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
doing some rough math here 104 days
 
06:01:03.270 --> 06:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
52 weeks
 
06:01:05.110 --> 06:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
if there were let's just say 20 legal
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
holidays i don't think there's that many
 
06:01:10.788 --> 06:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
if you would subtract 124 from 365 i got
 
06:01:13.750 --> 06:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
the number 241 days
 
06:01:15.190 --> 06:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
the number i come up with you divide
 
06:01:18.470 --> 06:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
that into the 2839 is less than 12 court
 
06:01:19.830 --> 06:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
hearings a day throughout the entire
 
06:01:19.840 --> 06:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
hearings a day throughout the entire
state

06:01:21.270 --> 06:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering would the with the
 
06:01:25.110 --> 06:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
court system at this moment time be able
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
to handle the 12 additional hearings
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire state so thank you
 
06:01:32.390 --> 06:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the question the the issue is
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
it would be great if crime were evenly
 
06:01:37.590 --> 06:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
distributed time and and geographically
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately it's not
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
um so what what i looked at it is
 
06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:48.310 --> 06:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
one we have really
 
06:01:50.708 --> 06:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
the the four again i'm focused on
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
circuit court the four circuit courts
 
06:01:55.270 --> 06:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
that i have the heaviest criminal docket
 
06:01:56.788 --> 06:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
is really where you're going to see the
 
06:01:59.670 --> 06:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
focus of of these decisions
 
06:01:59.680 --> 06:02:00.390 align:start position:0%
focus of of these decisions
so

06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
you've heard your manchester as being a
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
likely spot really what we're talking
 
06:02:06.310 --> 06:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
about manchester nashua concord and
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
rochester as being the four circuit
 
06:02:10.628 --> 06:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
courts that are most likely to be
 
06:02:10.638 --> 06:02:11.830 align:start position:0%
courts that are most likely to be
impacted

06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then i take from that you know a
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
total of
 
06:02:17.830 --> 06:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
within not just those four courts i
 
06:02:20.390 --> 06:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
admit but within primarily those four
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
courts i have to add 7.3 weeks of total
 
06:02:26.788 --> 06:02:26.798 align:start position:0%
hearing time so those those the numbers
 
06:02:28.628 --> 06:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about
 
06:02:31.190 --> 06:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're obviously talking about them in in
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
different number forms you know number
 
06:02:36.230 --> 06:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
of hearings versus hours of hearings or
 
06:02:38.788 --> 06:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
minutes of hearings those numbers
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
convert into into hours and minutes
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
and then you look at it from the
 
06:02:45.030 --> 06:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
perspective of
 
06:02:47.750 --> 06:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
the and i'm not talking judges so much
 
06:02:50.230 --> 06:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm talking staff within these four
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
circuit courts
 
06:02:54.070 --> 06:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
it is a remarkably complicated thing
 
06:02:56.390 --> 06:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
that they do incredibly well on a daily
 
06:02:58.868 --> 06:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
basis in circuit courts because people
 
06:02:59.910 --> 06:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
are getting a
 
06:03:02.150 --> 06:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's not like a civil case where you
 
06:03:04.470 --> 06:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
know you file a complaint the other side
 
06:03:07.190 --> 06:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
files an answer somebody has to do
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
something 30 days after that we're
 
06:03:11.670 --> 06:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
talking about things we don't know about
 
06:03:14.310 --> 06:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
that are happening so so
 
06:03:15.590 --> 06:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
clerk's offices are receiving the
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork and they then have to get a
 
06:03:24.310 --> 06:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
person the person who is the defendant
 
06:03:26.470 --> 06:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
in front of a judge whether that's going
 
06:03:30.070 --> 06:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
to be by a video or in person if it's
 
06:03:32.070 --> 06:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a video it's got to be
 
06:03:34.470 --> 06:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
coordinated with a county jail
 
06:03:36.150 --> 06:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
what is interesting about
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
covet in the pandemic is we have taken
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
advantage of the technology and we're
 
06:03:43.190 --> 06:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
holding more and more video arraignments
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
video hearings
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
and there are a limited number of slots
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
of video available in a particular jail
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
in a particular jail may have to
 
06:03:57.110 --> 06:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
feed those slots to multiple different
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
circuit courts
 
06:04:00.868 --> 06:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
so one circuit court may have nine to
 
06:04:03.190 --> 06:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
ten the next circuit court may have 10
 
06:04:05.670 --> 06:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
to 11. and there are you have to do
 
06:04:07.910 --> 06:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
those in 5.8 minutes so there are
 
06:04:09.990 --> 06:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
limited number of hearings you can hold
 
06:04:12.948 --> 06:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
in that hour and that limited number of
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
people that can be presented so i have a
 
06:04:17.910 --> 06:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
clerk who's trying to coordinate with it
 
06:04:20.788 --> 06:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
with a county jail to put a defendant in
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
front of a video camera and a judge in
 
06:04:24.310 --> 06:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
front of that
 
06:04:26.390 --> 06:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
camera on the opposite end to make sure
 
06:04:28.470 --> 06:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
we can have a bail hearing at the same
 
06:04:28.480 --> 06:04:29.670 align:start position:0%
we can have a bail hearing at the same
time

06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%
if that
 
06:04:33.030 --> 06:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
jail does not have an available video
 
06:04:34.788 --> 06:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
slot i probably in order to meet the
 
06:04:37.270 --> 06:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
time consequences the clerk has to now
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
arrange with a sheriff or transport from
 
06:04:41.830 --> 06:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
the jail to the courthouse
 
06:04:44.868 --> 06:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
so again it's it's a
 
06:04:46.628 --> 06:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
they are incredibly good at this because
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
it happens every day fairly seamlessly
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
um but it takes a great deal of effort
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
and manpower because all this is being
 
06:04:53.920 --> 06:04:56.070 align:start position:0%
and manpower because all this is being
done

06:04:56.070 --> 06:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
done
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an automatic process
 
06:04:59.040 --> 06:05:00.150 align:start position:0%
it's not an automatic process
so

06:05:00.150 --> 06:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
so yes it is a limited number of
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
hearings per year
 
06:05:08.628 --> 06:05:08.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen
 
06:05:11.190 --> 06:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
on an even spread on time and it happens
 
06:05:13.510 --> 06:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
primarily in a few courts and we have
 
06:05:14.948 --> 06:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
these clerks who have to make sure
 
06:05:16.948 --> 06:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
everything happens on time and happens
 
06:05:19.270 --> 06:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
well uh and they do it but it takes
 
06:05:21.590 --> 06:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
resources and and what we've seen what
 
06:05:23.750 --> 06:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
we also know in the clerics
 
06:05:26.470 --> 06:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
i ramble a little bit i apologize it's a
 
06:05:28.390 --> 06:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
long answer
 
06:05:28.400 --> 06:05:29.190 align:start position:0%
long answer
is

06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:05:29.200 --> 06:05:30.310 align:start position:0%
is
when

06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:05:33.270 --> 06:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
in 2011 when we converted to a circuit
 
06:05:34.708 --> 06:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
court system because remember we now
 
06:05:37.110 --> 06:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
have a circuit court system made up of
 
06:05:39.030 --> 06:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
three divisions the district division
 
06:05:40.470 --> 06:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
the probate division
 
06:05:42.548 --> 06:05:42.558 align:start position:0%
and the family division
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
circuit court judges hear all of those
 
06:05:47.190 --> 06:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
divisions so they may have bail they may
 
06:05:49.270 --> 06:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
have a domestic violence case they may
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
have a small claims case and they may
 
06:05:53.510 --> 06:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
have all those in the same morning
 
06:05:55.030 --> 06:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
because they're hearing all of the
 
06:05:57.270 --> 06:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
different types of cases
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
when we created the circuit court in
 
06:05:59.280 --> 06:06:00.788 align:start position:0%
when we created the circuit court in
2011

06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
2011
 
06:06:04.070 --> 06:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
we dramatically decreased the number of
 
06:06:06.150 --> 06:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
managerial positions in the clerk's
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
office so we we
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
can get the numbers a little bit wrong
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere from the in the 80s into the
 
06:06:14.470 --> 06:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
50s so we reduced that when we went to
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
electronic filing for some of the
 
06:06:18.868 --> 06:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
divisions we further significantly
 
06:06:20.788 --> 06:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
reduced clerk staff
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
in the circuit courts
 
06:06:24.708 --> 06:06:24.718 align:start position:0%
thinking the electronic filing would
 
06:06:26.548 --> 06:06:26.558 align:start position:0%
create the efficiencies
 
06:06:28.788 --> 06:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to reduce staff
 
06:06:30.708 --> 06:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
turns out we were wrong
 
06:06:30.718 --> 06:06:31.750 align:start position:0%
turns out we were wrong
and

06:06:31.750 --> 06:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:34.948 --> 06:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
the staff now is just overwhelmed
 
06:06:34.958 --> 06:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
the staff now is just overwhelmed
but

06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:06:38.548 --> 06:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
we did reduce f so so now
 
06:06:40.470 --> 06:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
what we're doing this session would be
 
06:06:40.480 --> 06:06:42.070 align:start position:0%
what we're doing this session would be
adding

06:06:42.070 --> 06:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
adding
 
06:06:42.080 --> 06:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
adding
um

06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:45.910 --> 06:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
bail reform we have two bail reform
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
bills that sort of collectively have a
 
06:06:51.910 --> 06:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
broad impact on primarily these four
 
06:06:56.868 --> 06:06:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:59.030 --> 06:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
repeal of felonies first
 
06:07:01.670 --> 06:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
which will shift felon initial felony
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
filings from the superior court into the
 
06:07:05.350 --> 06:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
06:07:07.910 --> 06:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
so that's another load that i'm not even
 
06:07:09.590 --> 06:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
talking about in the context of this
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill that's getting pushed into the
 
06:07:13.430 --> 06:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
06:07:13.440 --> 06:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
circuit court
and

06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:07:17.670 --> 06:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of the number of so i've talked
 
06:07:18.948 --> 06:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
about the number of staff that's
 
06:07:20.868 --> 06:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
available in the circuit court
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
i've also heard you know well you have
 
06:07:24.390 --> 06:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
more judges now
 
06:07:26.948 --> 06:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
which is true and which is fair
 
06:07:29.190 --> 06:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
except we have
 
06:07:32.390 --> 06:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
a reduction so not all judges are equal
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we had a number of senior judges or
 
06:07:37.350 --> 06:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
per diem judges
 
06:07:39.910 --> 06:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
that had retired but were still below
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
the age of 70 so who could perform that
 
06:07:45.510 --> 06:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
number has been reduced significantly so
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
if i take sort of
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
everything and i and i count them as
 
06:07:52.470 --> 06:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
what we call session days a seven and a
 
06:07:54.470 --> 06:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
half hour day in which a judge can sit
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
and hold session we're down actually a
 
06:07:59.910 --> 06:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
judge and a little over a judge
 
06:08:03.670 --> 06:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
since 2015 but we have these far more
 
06:08:05.430 --> 06:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
some of them incredibly complicated like
 
06:08:08.230 --> 06:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
i think we've doubled the number of
 
06:08:10.548 --> 06:08:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh termination of parental rights cases
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
and again circuit court judges hear all
 
06:08:15.750 --> 06:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
of them those are remarkably complicated
 
06:08:17.910 --> 06:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
and can take days in terms of of a
 
06:08:19.110 --> 06:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
judge's time
 
06:08:21.430 --> 06:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
so all this mix is
 
06:08:24.230 --> 06:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
is important to us obviously
 
06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of keeping the the trains
 
06:08:29.750 --> 06:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
running on time but also making sure
 
06:08:32.230 --> 06:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
that we actually get to all of the cases
 
06:08:34.548 --> 06:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
and as as we
 
06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
get more and more obligations that have
 
06:08:40.230 --> 06:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
to be reached something slips so things
 
06:08:41.830 --> 06:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
that don't have a constitutional
 
06:08:43.190 --> 06:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
deadline that things that don't have a
 
06:08:44.948 --> 06:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
statutory deadline
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
obviously get pushed because
 
06:08:49.430 --> 06:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
you only have so many hours in a day
 
06:08:52.310 --> 06:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
that you can do the work so i i say all
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
that not because i have a view on
 
06:08:57.030 --> 06:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's a good or a bad bill but
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
06:09:00.070 --> 06:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's coming to you without even a fiscal
 
06:09:01.510 --> 06:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
note from us
 
06:09:03.990 --> 06:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i do think that is relevant in terms
 
06:09:06.230 --> 06:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
of your decision-making process thank
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
06:09:09.830 --> 06:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
everybody may ask and this would be a
 
06:09:11.590 --> 06:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
much simpler question
 
06:09:13.590 --> 06:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i'll try not to take 15 minutes and
 
06:09:16.548 --> 06:09:16.558 align:start position:0%
answering it 2839
 
06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
and the majority of those are in nashua
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
concord rochester in manchester
 
06:09:22.948 --> 06:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
what percentage
 
06:09:26.070 --> 06:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
of the 2839 cases how many of those are
 
06:09:29.750 --> 06:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
in those four cities i don't know
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
i i did not break them down by
 
06:09:34.150 --> 06:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
individual counties or
 
06:09:36.470 --> 06:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
circuit courts i just have
 
06:09:38.070 --> 06:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
the total numbers for those circuit
 
06:09:39.990 --> 06:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
courts for all the circuit courts at
 
06:09:43.590 --> 06:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:45.990 --> 06:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.868 --> 06:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:09:53.788 --> 06:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
so the data that you gave us about the
 
06:09:57.190 --> 06:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
2839 additional cases
 
06:09:59.590 --> 06:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
is it the wording in the bill that says
 
06:10:01.750 --> 06:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
the person shall be detained in
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
pre-trial detention is that the wording
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
is that what causes this additional
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
number of cases to have to be
 
06:10:11.830 --> 06:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
heard since they now go to a judge
 
06:10:13.830 --> 06:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
apparently is that is that what it is so
 
06:10:15.030 --> 06:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
it could be bailed by a bail
 
06:10:15.040 --> 06:10:19.510 align:start position:0%
it could be bailed by a bail
commissioner

06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:20.788 --> 06:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:10:23.830 --> 06:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
and just for current right now when
 
06:10:24.948 --> 06:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
people see
 
06:10:26.470 --> 06:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
see bail commissioners and i believe
 
06:10:27.910 --> 06:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to see them according
 
06:10:30.070 --> 06:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
to that language
 
06:10:31.590 --> 06:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
who now
 
06:10:31.600 --> 06:10:32.390 align:start position:0%
who now
um

06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:34.628 --> 06:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
oversees the bail commissioners and
 
06:10:36.628 --> 06:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
provides for their training etc because
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
you said
 
06:10:40.070 --> 06:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
with the hypothetical case
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
that they would be under the supervision
 
06:10:44.150 --> 06:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
of a judge and they and and you might
 
06:10:46.070 --> 06:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
get more consistency or something like
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm paraphrasing
 
06:10:47.920 --> 06:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
that i'm paraphrasing
so

06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:51.910 --> 06:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
what is the status now who oversees them
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
and how are they trained and and and why
 
06:10:54.320 --> 06:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
and how are they trained and and and why
are

06:10:55.750 --> 06:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:10:56.948 --> 06:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'm not even going to ask you why it's a
 
06:10:58.788 --> 06:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
bit i'll just leave my question at that
 
06:11:02.070 --> 06:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question the the um
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners are not employees of
 
06:11:06.070 --> 06:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
the state so they're not subject to sort
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
of employee type of of
 
06:11:10.788 --> 06:11:10.798 align:start position:0%
oversight and personnel they are trained
 
06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
through the circuit court
 
06:11:15.190 --> 06:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
um and so the courts do the training are
 
06:11:17.350 --> 06:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for the training and do
 
06:11:18.948 --> 06:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
provide training
 
06:11:20.788 --> 06:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
there are
 
06:11:22.310 --> 06:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'll get this number wrong so don't hold
 
06:11:23.910 --> 06:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
me to this number somewhere over 100
 
06:11:25.670 --> 06:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not a small group it's a large
 
06:11:30.788 --> 06:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
group they don't have to respond
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
and some are some are very very good
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
and some are tend not to be as
 
06:11:35.280 --> 06:11:37.190 align:start position:0%
and some are tend not to be as
responsive

06:11:37.190 --> 06:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
06:11:37.200 --> 06:11:38.470 align:start position:0%
responsive
and

06:11:38.470 --> 06:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:41.350 --> 06:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
the only remedy the court has is to
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
revoke a commission we don't have sort
 
06:11:44.400 --> 06:11:45.190 align:start position:0%
revoke a commission we don't have sort
of

06:11:45.190 --> 06:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:11:48.470 --> 06:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
your standard employee type of of
 
06:11:49.990 --> 06:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
punishment that you can that you can
 
06:11:52.150 --> 06:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
impose on somebody who is not performing
 
06:11:54.150 --> 06:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
their duties appropriately
 
06:11:57.750 --> 06:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we then have a process for revoking a
 
06:11:57.760 --> 06:11:59.190 align:start position:0%
so we then have a process for revoking a
commission

06:11:59.190 --> 06:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:12:01.510 --> 06:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a process where
 
06:12:03.270 --> 06:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
they would be employees subject to the
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
personnel rules of the judicial branch
 
06:12:08.470 --> 06:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
and subject to you know what every other
 
06:12:10.070 --> 06:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
employee of the judicial branch is
 
06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
subject to thank you for that
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
06:12:17.190 --> 06:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
representative burke
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:12:22.390 --> 06:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
do you know why the lba is not asking
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal note because to me that's a
 
06:12:28.868 --> 06:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
red flag
 
06:12:28.878 --> 06:12:30.070 align:start position:0%
red flag
and

06:12:30.070 --> 06:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:32.070 --> 06:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
as a representative sitting on this
 
06:12:32.080 --> 06:12:33.830 align:start position:0%
as a representative sitting on this
committee

06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
seeing this bill
 
06:12:39.590 --> 06:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.600 --> 06:12:40.948 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:12:40.948 --> 06:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:12:41.910 --> 06:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
i i
 
06:12:43.990 --> 06:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question um i don't
 
06:12:44.000 --> 06:12:44.788 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question um i don't
know

06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:12:46.948 --> 06:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
the reason why how they make a decision
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
on who
 
06:12:50.548 --> 06:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
uh receives a a request for a fiscal
 
06:12:52.628 --> 06:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
note and who doesn't it is not this
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
isn't the only other times that happens
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know they have a lot of
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
bills and and
 
06:13:00.708 --> 06:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh they make a decision i think pretty
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
quickly but i don't know specifically on
 
06:13:05.350 --> 06:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill as to why we would not have
 
06:13:08.788 --> 06:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
seen it i have in senate bill 92
 
06:13:11.110 --> 06:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
presented what would be a very similar
 
06:13:12.868 --> 06:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note
 
06:13:15.750 --> 06:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
um for the amendment that was proposed
 
06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
in in senate bill 92 it would be very
 
06:13:20.708 --> 06:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
similar i've done the further analysis
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
that i've talked about today that's not
 
06:13:24.230 --> 06:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
in that draft of
 
06:13:26.628 --> 06:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
how many days of of actual hearing time
 
06:13:29.270 --> 06:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
it would take but it it does outline and
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
it does have that breakdown
 
06:13:35.510 --> 06:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
of um of cases from 2019 that i talked
 
06:13:37.590 --> 06:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
about i'd be happy to obviously provide
 
06:13:38.708 --> 06:13:38.718 align:start position:0%
anything to the committee that the
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
committee wants and i can resubmit a
 
06:13:43.430 --> 06:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
copy of that it won't be updated though
 
06:13:45.510 --> 06:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
if you wish
 
06:13:50.230 --> 06:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:52.150 --> 06:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
06:13:53.670 --> 06:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr head
 
06:13:55.190 --> 06:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
for taking the question does it stand to
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
reason that
 
06:13:57.120 --> 06:13:58.070 align:start position:0%
reason that
uh

06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
some of the 2849 or so folks
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh who would be now subject to this and
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
create that
 
06:14:07.110 --> 06:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
situation in the court system
 
06:14:09.510 --> 06:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
are themselves arrested multiple times
 
06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
and then would be sort of taken out of
 
06:14:10.878 --> 06:14:11.830 align:start position:0%
and then would be sort of taken out of
commission

06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh if this bill were to pass and they
 
06:14:15.190 --> 06:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to i guess the point of
 
06:14:16.628 --> 06:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
making is it
 
06:14:18.230 --> 06:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
i think you understand the question is
 
06:14:20.310 --> 06:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
it possible that one person
 
06:14:21.990 --> 06:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be needed to be arraigned multiple
 
06:14:24.390 --> 06:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
times under that number you gave um so
 
06:14:26.310 --> 06:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question fair point um
 
06:14:28.948 --> 06:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
so some of these may be the same person
 
06:14:31.190 --> 06:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't aggregate out people
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
have been re-arrested so
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of these may be the same person
 
06:14:38.548 --> 06:14:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:41.430 --> 06:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
these are cases so so what i have are
 
06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
case numbers
 
06:14:44.830 --> 06:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and follow
 
06:14:47.750 --> 06:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
up um would knowing that you know time
 
06:14:50.150 --> 06:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of the essence and
 
06:14:50.160 --> 06:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
is somewhat of the essence and
uh

06:14:51.590 --> 06:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
around the fiscal note and around the
 
06:14:55.350 --> 06:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
logistics that you've mentioned with
 
06:14:57.430 --> 06:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
delaying this to the start of the new
 
06:14:59.430 --> 06:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year address some of those
 
06:15:02.070 --> 06:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
concerns allowing for time to
 
06:15:03.990 --> 06:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
properly roll it out and properly fund
 
06:15:04.000 --> 06:15:05.190 align:start position:0%
properly roll it out and properly fund
it

06:15:05.190 --> 06:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:15:07.030 --> 06:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question yes i
 
06:15:08.548 --> 06:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
think that would absolutely you know we
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
could then
 
06:15:12.548 --> 06:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into our discussion in
 
06:15:16.150 --> 06:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
the budget session um would would would
 
06:15:18.788 --> 06:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
be correct and then you know those those
 
06:15:21.510 --> 06:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal issues could be addressed through
 
06:15:24.788 --> 06:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
the budget process if the if the
 
06:15:27.270 --> 06:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
effective dates took that into account
 
06:15:33.590 --> 06:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.750 --> 06:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
if i may inquire over a question
 
06:15:36.708 --> 06:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
let's just
 
06:15:38.548 --> 06:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
say for the sake we were to get a fiscal
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
note from the court how would it be how
 
06:15:43.270 --> 06:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
would you distinguish between
 
06:15:45.030 --> 06:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
expenses for court hearings that are
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
already scheduled to occur in factoring
 
06:15:50.310 --> 06:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
the one one two or three a few extra
 
06:15:52.150 --> 06:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
hearings in one day
 
06:15:54.548 --> 06:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
i mean what would i would i in terms of
 
06:15:57.030 --> 06:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that i put together for
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
92 what i assumed would be a new judge
 
06:16:02.788 --> 06:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
for each of those four courts and a new
 
06:16:02.798 --> 06:16:03.830 align:start position:0%
for each of those four courts and a new
clerk

06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
staff for each of those four courts and
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
a court monitor
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
was was how i calculated the the fiscal
 
06:16:09.600 --> 06:16:11.030 align:start position:0%
was was how i calculated the the fiscal
impact

06:16:11.030 --> 06:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
impact
 
06:16:11.040 --> 06:16:11.990 align:start position:0%
impact
obviously

06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
06:16:13.830 --> 06:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
we can we can have a conversation about
 
06:16:15.670 --> 06:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
whether that is
 
06:16:18.310 --> 06:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
that makes sense or not you know once
 
06:16:20.070 --> 06:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
once you put it once you
 
06:16:20.080 --> 06:16:22.230 align:start position:0%
once you put it once you
[Music]

06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:16:24.470 --> 06:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
put a load on a new system
 
06:16:27.110 --> 06:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
you can't you you can't re it's
 
06:16:30.230 --> 06:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to respond with a
 
06:16:32.868 --> 06:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh with a with a quarter of a judge in a
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
location or a quarter of a staff person
 
06:16:38.948 --> 06:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
in a location so what it would
 
06:16:40.708 --> 06:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
what it would so that was the reason
 
06:16:43.670 --> 06:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
behind sort of the the fiscal note that
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
i put together for that was i'm assuming
 
06:16:47.350 --> 06:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:16:49.510 --> 06:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
significant impact on those four courts
 
06:16:53.030 --> 06:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
which are already stressed um and that
 
06:16:55.350 --> 06:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
would be the the relief that would that
 
06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
would be required
 
06:16:59.750 --> 06:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
um it is also well i'll stop there thank
 
06:16:59.760 --> 06:17:00.470 align:start position:0%
um it is also well i'll stop there thank
you

06:17:00.470 --> 06:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:17:01.990 --> 06:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
can you please correct me if i'm wrong
 
06:17:03.670 --> 06:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
how many vacancies right now do we have
 
06:17:05.990 --> 06:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the circuit court three uh there's
 
06:17:10.070 --> 06:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
two vacancies in terms of judges um we
 
06:17:11.910 --> 06:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
two judge vacancies we have a marital
 
06:17:14.470 --> 06:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
master who's uh who's
 
06:17:16.948 --> 06:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
indicated that he is retiring so that
 
06:17:19.510 --> 06:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
would create a third vacancy
 
06:17:20.788 --> 06:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
06:17:22.150 --> 06:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:17:22.160 --> 06:17:23.270 align:start position:0%
you know
uh

06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:25.350 --> 06:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
in the last not today's governor council
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
but the last one uh one of the
 
06:17:29.910 --> 06:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court judges that would be
 
06:17:33.030 --> 06:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
filled was rejected nobody was
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
nominated today
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the governor and council so i expect
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
those three vacancies to continue for a
 
06:17:40.150 --> 06:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
06:17:43.030 --> 06:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:44.708 --> 06:17:44.718 align:start position:0%
you know whatever time to get a new
 
06:17:49.030 --> 06:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
judge appointed in place and trained
 
06:17:50.070 --> 06:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
we're expecting a sort of a lag there
 
06:17:55.190 --> 06:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
all of these have ripple effects within
 
06:17:56.310 --> 06:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
the system
 
06:17:59.430 --> 06:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
so you know once you take resources out
 
06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
we then have to figure out what to do
 
06:18:03.830 --> 06:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
with it some things get pushed further
 
06:18:06.390 --> 06:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
and you know we're in we're still in
 
06:18:08.390 --> 06:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic recovery
 
06:18:12.150 --> 06:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
and the court systems have the same
 
06:18:13.990 --> 06:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
hiring issues that other
 
06:18:16.470 --> 06:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
everybody else in the state has so when
 
06:18:18.548 --> 06:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
we have positions available in the
 
06:18:20.310 --> 06:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
clerk's offices they're not all being
 
06:18:23.910 --> 06:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
filled so we have within our full
 
06:18:25.590 --> 06:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
funded clerks
 
06:18:28.150 --> 06:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
staffing vacancies that we're having
 
06:18:28.160 --> 06:18:29.270 align:start position:0%
staffing vacancies that we're having
difficulties

06:18:29.270 --> 06:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
06:18:31.110 --> 06:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
filling as as everybody's having these
 
06:18:31.120 --> 06:18:32.070 align:start position:0%
filling as as everybody's having these
days

06:18:32.070 --> 06:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
days
 
06:18:33.830 --> 06:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
so there's there's stress there's stress
 
06:18:37.990 --> 06:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.910 --> 06:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
06:18:41.990 --> 06:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um and thank you for
 
06:18:43.430 --> 06:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:18:43.440 --> 06:18:45.190 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:18:45.190 --> 06:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:46.788 --> 06:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
i i'm
 
06:18:48.390 --> 06:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
massively confused on some of the
 
06:18:49.830 --> 06:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
figures that were
 
06:18:52.468 --> 06:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
were using here
 
06:18:55.430 --> 06:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
mr head you've referred to a 3000
 
06:18:56.830 --> 06:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
additional here uh
 
06:19:00.468 --> 06:19:00.478 align:start position:0%
2800 3000 whatever and you factored that
 
06:19:01.750 --> 06:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
06:19:03.910 --> 06:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
7.3 weeks
 
06:19:05.990 --> 06:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
of new hearings per year
 
06:19:06.000 --> 06:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
of new hearings per year
correct

06:19:07.190 --> 06:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:19:08.230 --> 06:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
06:19:10.070 --> 06:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
other people are saying that these
 
06:19:12.628 --> 06:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
figures only amount to 12 additional
 
06:19:12.638 --> 06:19:14.468 align:start position:0%
figures only amount to 12 additional
hearings

06:19:14.468 --> 06:19:14.478 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
06:19:14.478 --> 06:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
hearings
per

06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
per
 
06:19:18.310 --> 06:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:18.320 --> 06:19:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:22.070 --> 06:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
06:19:25.510 --> 06:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:27.510 --> 06:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'll took you how i did the math
 
06:19:27.520 --> 06:19:28.868 align:start position:0%
i'll took you how i did the math
um

06:19:28.868 --> 06:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:32.868 --> 06:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh so i took the the 2800 cases
 
06:19:35.110 --> 06:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i assumed they would all take 5.8
 
06:19:35.120 --> 06:19:36.150 align:start position:0%
and i assumed they would all take 5.8
minutes

06:19:36.150 --> 06:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
06:19:38.788 --> 06:19:38.798 align:start position:0%
so that gives me i now have 16
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
524 minutes i have to add into the
 
06:19:41.440 --> 06:19:42.788 align:start position:0%
524 minutes i have to add into the
system

06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:19:46.468 --> 06:19:46.478 align:start position:0%
that's 275 hours and if i have seven and
 
06:19:48.628 --> 06:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
a half hour session days
 
06:19:51.350 --> 06:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh that's 36 days and if i take out the
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
weekends i have 7.3 weeks of seven and a
 
06:19:57.030 --> 06:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
half year hearing
 
06:19:57.040 --> 06:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
half year hearing
days

06:19:58.390 --> 06:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
days
 
06:20:00.708 --> 06:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
of additional time i need to
 
06:20:04.468 --> 06:20:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative true recognized for
 
06:20:09.430 --> 06:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you mr chair so
 
06:20:15.030 --> 06:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:16.868 --> 06:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
based on
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 294
 
06:20:23.030 --> 06:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
the new pre-trial hearings is that those
 
06:20:24.708 --> 06:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
are just bail hearings
 
06:20:27.430 --> 06:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
i mean bail hearings
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
but these these are new bail hearings
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
correct new no sorry yes new bail
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
hearings with a judge in the in in court
 
06:20:37.030 --> 06:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you correct
 
06:20:39.350 --> 06:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
and and i caveat that with with
 
06:20:40.868 --> 06:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
representative conley's point which is
 
06:20:42.868 --> 06:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
some of these are probably duplicates
 
06:20:47.910 --> 06:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:52.310 --> 06:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
not duplicates but but same person twice
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
06:20:56.948 --> 06:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question again
 
06:20:56.958 --> 06:20:57.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question again
um

06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:00.230 --> 06:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
with all of the attention and time that
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
we've been spending on trying to create
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
a legislative solution to the problems
 
06:21:07.030 --> 06:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
that have been mentioned
 
06:21:08.948 --> 06:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering is there are there steps
 
06:21:11.350 --> 06:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
that the court system itself
 
06:21:13.430 --> 06:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
is taking to address
 
06:21:15.750 --> 06:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
some of the the inconsistencies some of
 
06:21:18.468 --> 06:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
the anecdotes that we hear about
 
06:21:21.590 --> 06:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
we do try to be responsive to when there
 
06:21:27.110 --> 06:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
are complaints of of issues with with
 
06:21:29.910 --> 06:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners we do try to provide
 
06:21:29.920 --> 06:21:31.430 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners we do try to provide
training

06:21:31.430 --> 06:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
training
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we have and we make training
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
materials available at all times to bail
 
06:21:36.320 --> 06:21:38.468 align:start position:0%
materials available at all times to bail
commissioners

06:21:38.468 --> 06:21:38.478 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
06:21:41.430 --> 06:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
when we do hear of problems where
 
06:21:43.830 --> 06:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
and there certainly have been
 
06:21:43.840 --> 06:21:44.830 align:start position:0%
and there certainly have been
where

06:21:44.830 --> 06:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:21:46.868 --> 06:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
inappropriate bail decisions are being
 
06:21:46.878 --> 06:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
inappropriate bail decisions are being
made

06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
06:21:49.590 --> 06:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:21:51.590 --> 06:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not just bail decisions that
 
06:21:55.350 --> 06:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
are being made it is um our
 
06:21:57.350 --> 06:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners informing properly
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
informing the defendants of their
 
06:22:01.750 --> 06:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
hearing dates are they getting accurate
 
06:22:03.910 --> 06:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
information from bail commissioners
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
are they
 
06:22:05.040 --> 06:22:06.468 align:start position:0%
are they
um

06:22:06.468 --> 06:22:06.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:07.590 --> 06:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
are they
 
06:22:09.670 --> 06:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
submitting paperwork to the courts on
 
06:22:11.990 --> 06:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
time within the 20-day window for
 
06:22:12.000 --> 06:22:13.990 align:start position:0%
time within the 20-day window for
arraignments

06:22:13.990 --> 06:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
arraignments
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
there are a large
 
06:22:18.948 --> 06:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
range of potential issues that it that
 
06:22:20.708 --> 06:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
that we can have with a bail
 
06:22:22.390 --> 06:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner and again i want to
 
06:22:24.230 --> 06:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate there are a large number of
 
06:22:26.708 --> 06:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
them who are very very good
 
06:22:26.718 --> 06:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
them who are very very good
but

06:22:27.750 --> 06:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:22:30.310 --> 06:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
there are obviously times when
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's unsatisfactory performance so if
 
06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
we do get a complaint those are
 
06:22:35.520 --> 06:22:37.350 align:start position:0%
we do get a complaint those are
investigated

06:22:37.350 --> 06:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
investigated
 
06:22:37.360 --> 06:22:38.230 align:start position:0%
investigated
and

06:22:38.230 --> 06:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:38.240 --> 06:22:39.110 align:start position:0%
and
if

06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:22:41.030 --> 06:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
additional training is needed
 
06:22:44.310 --> 06:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
additional training is provided if
 
06:22:46.468 --> 06:22:46.478 align:start position:0%
if removal of a commission is needed
 
06:22:48.628 --> 06:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
then that's then that occurs
 
06:22:50.948 --> 06:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
we do try to be responsive and again
 
06:22:52.548 --> 06:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
some of its staffing to make sure that
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
somebody's available to perform the
 
06:22:56.230 --> 06:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
investigations i've seen some of those
 
06:22:57.990 --> 06:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
they do occur
 
06:22:58.000 --> 06:22:58.948 align:start position:0%
they do occur
and

06:22:58.948 --> 06:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:23:00.310 --> 06:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
commissions that have been revoked there
 
06:23:03.990 --> 06:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
have been training
 
06:23:06.948 --> 06:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities given
 
06:23:09.350 --> 06:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
so yes we do try to be responsive to
 
06:23:11.590 --> 06:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
where we when we hear about a specific
 
06:23:11.600 --> 06:23:13.430 align:start position:0%
where we when we hear about a specific
problem

06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:23:17.990 --> 06:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:19.270 --> 06:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raising thank the
 
06:23:23.350 --> 06:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:25.190 --> 06:23:25.200 align:start position:0%

the issue of bail and um

folks being released who
 
06:24:30.070 --> 06:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily shouldn't be released
 
06:24:32.150 --> 06:24:32.160 align:start position:0%

06:24:48.788 --> 06:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
these aren't these aren't fear tactics
 
06:24:51.030 --> 06:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
these are these are real stories
 
06:24:51.040 --> 06:24:51.990 align:start position:0%
these are these are real stories
um

06:24:51.990 --> 06:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:54.948 --> 06:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
we have to answer to victims of crime we
 
06:24:56.548 --> 06:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
have to answer to
 
06:24:58.948 --> 06:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
members of the community that will often
 
06:25:01.750 --> 06:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
contact public safety and ask why people
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
have been released when they maybe
 
06:25:06.150 --> 06:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been released
 
06:25:07.750 --> 06:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that have to answer to
 
06:25:07.760 --> 06:25:08.548 align:start position:0%
we're the ones that have to answer to
those

06:25:08.548 --> 06:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:25:10.390 --> 06:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're here to address a specific issue
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we have worked really hard um to try
 
06:25:19.590 --> 06:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
and come up with solutions
 
06:25:22.948 --> 06:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
we're willing to continue to work hard
 
06:25:25.030 --> 06:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
to come up with solutions with the
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
various stakeholders
 
06:25:29.030 --> 06:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you know the bail
 
06:25:32.628 --> 06:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
system remains fair uh for everyone
 
06:25:34.788 --> 06:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
um we feel as though the language
 
06:25:39.030 --> 06:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
contained within 294 is a specific fix
 
06:25:40.310 --> 06:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
it addresses
 
06:25:43.110 --> 06:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
violent serious offenses which is
 
06:25:45.990 --> 06:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
obviously the the first issue that many
 
06:25:48.070 --> 06:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
many communities have experienced as
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
well as though those folks who um are
 
06:25:53.670 --> 06:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
arrested released on bail and arrested
 
06:25:56.390 --> 06:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
again released on bail this the cycle
 
06:25:59.510 --> 06:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we see these are very
 
06:26:00.788 --> 06:26:00.798 align:start position:0%
real issues
 
06:26:04.548 --> 06:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
within the community i'll also say that
 
06:26:06.070 --> 06:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
i would never
 
06:26:08.070 --> 06:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i know i speak from my colleagues in
 
06:26:12.310 --> 06:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement we would never advocate
 
06:26:13.910 --> 06:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
for a person being
 
06:26:15.510 --> 06:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
denied bill
 
06:26:17.030 --> 06:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
what we are saying
 
06:26:19.270 --> 06:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
is that we feel as though certain
 
06:26:23.750 --> 06:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:26.230 --> 06:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
in order to make a determination on bail
 
06:26:29.190 --> 06:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
those cases those instances
 
06:26:31.510 --> 06:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
should be heard in front of a judge
 
06:26:33.270 --> 06:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we're seeing here
 
06:26:35.590 --> 06:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
and we are certainly
 
06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
willing to work to come up with
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh an amended version of the bill uh to
 
06:26:42.548 --> 06:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
make it more amenable to to you folks as
 
06:26:44.868 --> 06:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
well as the various stakeholders
 
06:26:48.390 --> 06:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
um we've considered um you know reducing
 
06:26:48.400 --> 06:26:49.350 align:start position:0%
um we've considered um you know reducing
uh

06:26:49.350 --> 06:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:26:51.990 --> 06:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
the offenses within uh the first section
 
06:26:54.468 --> 06:26:54.478 align:start position:0%
which carves out the specific offenses
 
06:26:57.190 --> 06:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've also made it a point to make sure
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
and we will make it a point to make sure
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:04.788 --> 06:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
persons not being denied bail
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
solely under the basis
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
of their financial condition remains in
 
06:27:11.830 --> 06:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
the current bail statute
 
06:27:11.840 --> 06:27:13.190 align:start position:0%
the current bail statute
um

06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:15.270 --> 06:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
so with that uh captain do you have
 
06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
anything to answer yes i would thank you
 
06:27:18.638 --> 06:27:20.150 align:start position:0%
anything to answer yes i would thank you
um

06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
as a representative of the manchester
 
06:27:23.590 --> 06:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
police department
 
06:27:25.110 --> 06:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know i like to come before you and
 
06:27:29.590 --> 06:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
and tell you that we do support um 294
 
06:27:31.590 --> 06:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
or perhaps maybe a modified version of
 
06:27:32.948 --> 06:27:32.958 align:start position:0%
that based on some of the input we've
 
06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
heard today from the attorney general's
 
06:27:34.798 --> 06:27:35.750 align:start position:0%
heard today from the attorney general's
office

06:27:35.750 --> 06:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:27:38.070 --> 06:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
and others
 
06:27:41.670 --> 06:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
the as well intentioned as the original
 
06:27:44.230 --> 06:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
legislation back in 2018 may have been
 
06:27:46.468 --> 06:27:46.478 align:start position:0%
with regard to bail reform
 
06:27:49.190 --> 06:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
i think we have seen over the past year
 
06:27:50.708 --> 06:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
and some months
 
06:27:52.310 --> 06:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
right in the city of manchester that
 
06:27:52.320 --> 06:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
right in the city of manchester that
this

06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:27:55.830 --> 06:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
the existing legislation just um
 
06:27:57.270 --> 06:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
isn't working
 
06:27:58.868 --> 06:27:58.878 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
06:27:58.878 --> 06:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
um it's
uh

06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
there's clearly there clearly uh there's
 
06:28:05.830 --> 06:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
clearly room for improvement um
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know i've heard a lot about the
 
06:28:09.670 --> 06:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
stories and the anecdotes and these this
 
06:28:11.590 --> 06:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
is in folklore this is these are
 
06:28:14.230 --> 06:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
specific cases that you can you can look
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
up yourself so with names and victims
 
06:28:18.628 --> 06:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
just in january we had uh you know a
 
06:28:23.270 --> 06:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
defendant by the name of jessica
 
06:28:26.788 --> 06:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
leferria she was arrested for
 
06:28:26.798 --> 06:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
leferria she was arrested for
allegedly

06:28:28.070 --> 06:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
allegedly
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
physically assaulting a child this child
 
06:28:32.310 --> 06:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
exhibited bruises all up and down their
 
06:28:32.320 --> 06:28:33.270 align:start position:0%
exhibited bruises all up and down their
body

06:28:33.270 --> 06:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
body
 
06:28:35.430 --> 06:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
she was released on pr bail
 
06:28:35.440 --> 06:28:36.468 align:start position:0%
she was released on pr bail
um

06:28:36.468 --> 06:28:36.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:38.948 --> 06:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
she was she was let out
 
06:28:41.110 --> 06:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
where's the consideration for the victim
 
06:28:42.150 --> 06:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
in this
 
06:28:43.510 --> 06:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
so clearly there's
 
06:28:44.548 --> 06:28:44.558 align:start position:0%
there are things that need to be
 
06:28:47.190 --> 06:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
addressed and and i think that the the
 
06:28:49.910 --> 06:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
language in in 294
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
um is a as a surgical approach it
 
06:28:55.190 --> 06:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
specifically enumerates you know those
 
06:28:57.190 --> 06:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
13 crimes which i think when you look at
 
06:28:59.190 --> 06:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
them you can agree that those are
 
06:29:01.030 --> 06:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
the most egregious crimes you know
 
06:29:03.110 --> 06:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
people can commit in our society
 
06:29:03.120 --> 06:29:03.910 align:start position:0%
people can commit in our society
um

06:29:03.910 --> 06:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:03.920 --> 06:29:04.948 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:29:04.948 --> 06:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:29:06.548 --> 06:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
you know we had another instance back in
 
06:29:06.558 --> 06:29:07.750 align:start position:0%
you know we had another instance back in
september

06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
september
 
06:29:07.760 --> 06:29:08.628 align:start position:0%
september
um

06:29:08.628 --> 06:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:10.468 --> 06:29:10.478 align:start position:0%
very recently we had
 
06:29:13.270 --> 06:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
justin shaw he he was arrested for
 
06:29:13.280 --> 06:29:14.948 align:start position:0%
justin shaw he he was arrested for
robbery

06:29:14.948 --> 06:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
robbery
 
06:29:17.110 --> 06:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
less than 24 hours later after being
 
06:29:17.120 --> 06:29:18.310 align:start position:0%
less than 24 hours later after being
bailed

06:29:18.310 --> 06:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
bailed
 
06:29:22.070 --> 06:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
back in
 
06:29:25.270 --> 06:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
april of last year
 
06:29:26.310 --> 06:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
06:29:29.030 --> 06:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
gentleman by the name of tariq alston
 
06:29:30.310 --> 06:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
who um
 
06:29:31.990 --> 06:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know he was he was running across a
 
06:29:34.788 --> 06:29:34.798 align:start position:0%
parking lot firing shots from a gun
 
06:29:34.798 --> 06:29:35.750 align:start position:0%
parking lot firing shots from a gun
um

06:29:35.750 --> 06:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:38.070 --> 06:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
he was released on pr bail and then he
 
06:29:39.670 --> 06:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
was subsequently arrested several other
 
06:29:42.390 --> 06:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
times subsequent to that release you
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
know uh for for running from the police
 
06:29:46.708 --> 06:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
and falsifying physical evidence
 
06:29:48.070 --> 06:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:29:50.070 --> 06:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know from for violating his bail
 
06:29:51.910 --> 06:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
conditions by trying to go into a gun
 
06:29:54.390 --> 06:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
store and buy ammunition
 
06:29:56.468 --> 06:29:56.478 align:start position:0%
so you know there's there's clearly room
 
06:29:58.310 --> 06:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
for improvement here
 
06:30:00.230 --> 06:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
um i've heard a lot of
 
06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
of people who are opposed to the bill
 
06:30:05.590 --> 06:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
talk talk as if this is um
 
06:30:08.230 --> 06:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is a denial of the person's right
 
06:30:09.990 --> 06:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
to bail that you know this is some
 
06:30:11.750 --> 06:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
attempt by law enforcement to hold
 
06:30:13.590 --> 06:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
people indefinitely
 
06:30:13.600 --> 06:30:14.468 align:start position:0%
people indefinitely
um

06:30:14.468 --> 06:30:14.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:17.190 --> 06:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's it's not that at all it's it's a
 
06:30:20.070 --> 06:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much a pumping of the brakes
 
06:30:21.670 --> 06:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you how many times people
 
06:30:22.868 --> 06:30:22.878 align:start position:0%
have been
 
06:30:25.670 --> 06:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
arrested by manchester officers
 
06:30:27.350 --> 06:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be walking out of the police station
 
06:30:29.670 --> 06:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
on pr bail before the officer is even
 
06:30:31.750 --> 06:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
done writing their reports
 
06:30:31.760 --> 06:30:33.670 align:start position:0%
done writing their reports
so

06:30:33.670 --> 06:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
how can a bail commissioner make
 
06:30:38.468 --> 06:30:38.478 align:start position:0%
an informed decision
 
06:30:41.350 --> 06:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
if their report isn't even done yet
 
06:30:42.150 --> 06:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:30:44.310 --> 06:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh you just heard from the testimony
 
06:30:46.708 --> 06:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
that came before ours um you know
 
06:30:48.390 --> 06:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes bail commissioners make
 
06:30:48.400 --> 06:30:49.590 align:start position:0%
sometimes bail commissioners make
mistakes

06:30:49.590 --> 06:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
06:30:51.270 --> 06:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
and we're just trying to minimize that
 
06:30:53.030 --> 06:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
because if
 
06:30:54.788 --> 06:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
if 294
 
06:30:57.830 --> 06:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
if the amendment is made through 294
 
06:31:00.230 --> 06:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
that that pretty much puts
 
06:31:02.708 --> 06:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
the full picture before a judge
 
06:31:05.270 --> 06:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
during the very next arraignment date
 
06:31:06.390 --> 06:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
nobody is looking to hold anybody
 
06:31:10.868 --> 06:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
any longer than they need to be held but
 
06:31:12.628 --> 06:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair to say that for these
 
06:31:16.070 --> 06:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
specific 13 egregious crimes
 
06:31:18.150 --> 06:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
that a judge
 
06:31:20.070 --> 06:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
should take a look at the full set of
 
06:31:23.430 --> 06:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
facts at the very next court date
 
06:31:25.190 --> 06:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
and determine what is the appropriate
 
06:31:25.200 --> 06:31:26.390 align:start position:0%
and determine what is the appropriate
bail

06:31:26.390 --> 06:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
bail
 
06:31:27.990 --> 06:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that that that
 
06:31:29.910 --> 06:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's not every time you know
 
06:31:31.910 --> 06:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner will still serve a
 
06:31:34.070 --> 06:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
function but it's for for those specific
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
crimes that we can all agree are are the
 
06:31:36.478 --> 06:31:37.510 align:start position:0%
crimes that we can all agree are are the
worst

06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
worst
 
06:31:39.430 --> 06:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
um and the most and represent the
 
06:31:42.150 --> 06:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
biggest danger to our society that that
 
06:31:44.390 --> 06:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps somebody should take a
 
06:31:46.830 --> 06:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
closer look at that
 
06:31:51.430 --> 06:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:51.440 --> 06:31:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:56.708 --> 06:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
i'll just say this listen i i fully
 
06:31:58.788 --> 06:31:58.798 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a
 
06:32:00.390 --> 06:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
emotional debate
 
06:32:03.190 --> 06:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
on a very important topic
 
06:32:05.510 --> 06:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i certainly am
 
06:32:07.270 --> 06:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
we certainly respect the points of view
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
of everyone in the testimony provided
 
06:32:13.190 --> 06:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
um but we just want folks to know that
 
06:32:13.200 --> 06:32:14.628 align:start position:0%
um but we just want folks to know that
um

06:32:14.628 --> 06:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:16.548 --> 06:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to
 
06:32:18.310 --> 06:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know uphold the constitution
 
06:32:20.948 --> 06:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
obviously but to protect victims and to
 
06:32:23.990 --> 06:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
make sure our communities are safe and
 
06:32:26.548 --> 06:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
and that is our intent in being here um
 
06:32:28.070 --> 06:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
so with that we certainly appreciate
 
06:32:29.910 --> 06:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
your time we'll open up to any questions
 
06:32:36.230 --> 06:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:38.230 --> 06:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
represented burt
 
06:32:40.310 --> 06:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:32:43.670 --> 06:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:46.070 --> 06:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
the scenarios you gave
 
06:32:48.548 --> 06:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
the committee you know with the crimes
 
06:32:50.310 --> 06:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh one gentleman running through a
 
06:32:55.430 --> 06:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:58.390 --> 06:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
if i understood the previous testimony
 
06:33:01.910 --> 06:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
those people can be held
 
06:33:04.708 --> 06:33:04.718 align:start position:0%
at those crime levels
 
06:33:04.718 --> 06:33:06.868 align:start position:0%
at those crime levels
yes

06:33:06.868 --> 06:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:33:08.708 --> 06:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
yes sir they can be
 
06:33:09.990 --> 06:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:33:12.628 --> 06:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
there have been instances however
 
06:33:15.110 --> 06:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
when the bail commissioner releases an
 
06:33:15.120 --> 06:33:16.548 align:start position:0%
when the bail commissioner releases an
individual

06:33:16.548 --> 06:33:16.558 align:start position:0%
individual
 
06:33:20.468 --> 06:33:20.478 align:start position:0%
and that person is cut loose on pr
 
06:33:22.948 --> 06:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
that person's already out even if we
 
06:33:25.030 --> 06:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
subsequently engage in the mechanisms
 
06:33:27.510 --> 06:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
that allow us to challenge
 
06:33:29.670 --> 06:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
that later on that person is still now
 
06:33:29.680 --> 06:33:31.990 align:start position:0%
that later on that person is still now
free

06:33:31.990 --> 06:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
free
 
06:33:34.310 --> 06:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
after allegedly committing some very
 
06:33:35.990 --> 06:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
serious crimes
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
06:33:39.110 --> 06:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes to answer your question there is a
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
way to prevent that from happening
 
06:33:43.430 --> 06:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not it's not as easy as you
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
know bail commissioner goes i i'm going
 
06:33:47.110 --> 06:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
to release it on pr and the officer says
 
06:33:48.868 --> 06:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's a good idea and
 
06:33:51.030 --> 06:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
then it stops it's no
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
you have to file a motion and it has to
 
06:33:55.430 --> 06:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
be heard in a court next day
 
06:33:55.440 --> 06:33:56.948 align:start position:0%
be heard in a court next day
um

06:33:56.948 --> 06:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:58.230 --> 06:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
06:34:02.788 --> 06:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
kind of but you know that's not how i'm
 
06:34:06.868 --> 06:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
understanding that you know i'm hearing
 
06:34:10.150 --> 06:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
that if the police
 
06:34:12.230 --> 06:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
do the paperwork right
 
06:34:14.468 --> 06:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
and not saying that you don't but if
 
06:34:16.628 --> 06:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
there's a certain way to do it to lock
 
06:34:18.628 --> 06:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
these people up to make sure they have
 
06:34:20.390 --> 06:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
to go in front of a judge because
 
06:34:22.788 --> 06:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
somebody running through the parking lot
 
06:34:24.948 --> 06:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
shooting a gun in the air
 
06:34:27.030 --> 06:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
he shouldn't be out and i understand
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
that they can lock him up in the the
 
06:34:31.910 --> 06:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
bail guy
 
06:34:34.628 --> 06:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
you know cannot release him
 
06:34:35.750 --> 06:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's our point with those specifically
 
06:34:39.190 --> 06:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
carved out
 
06:34:41.910 --> 06:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh offenses listed in the very beginning
 
06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
section of
 
06:34:46.070 --> 06:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation is
 
06:34:47.670 --> 06:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
that should be a determination in our
 
06:34:49.510 --> 06:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
opinion made by a judge not a bail
 
06:34:52.468 --> 06:34:52.478 align:start position:0%
commissioner so those errors don't occur
 
06:34:55.190 --> 06:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what we we find there
 
06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
are issues here i mean these folks there
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
are instances these are not
 
06:35:02.628 --> 06:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
um you know fictional stories
 
06:35:03.830 --> 06:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
people are being released and they
 
06:35:06.310 --> 06:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be released we need to fix it
 
06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you for your
 
06:35:09.990 --> 06:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
question sorry
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i know there have been a lot of um
 
06:35:15.270 --> 06:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
facts and figures thrown around um
 
06:35:17.430 --> 06:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
by some people who oppose the
 
06:35:19.910 --> 06:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
legislation and um
 
06:35:21.590 --> 06:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know we we at the manchester police
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
department conducted our own assessment
 
06:35:24.638 --> 06:35:25.590 align:start position:0%
department conducted our own assessment
um

06:35:25.590 --> 06:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:27.030 --> 06:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
06:35:29.430 --> 06:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
we looked at the 12 months prior to the
 
06:35:33.270 --> 06:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
2018 legislation and then the 12 months
 
06:35:33.280 --> 06:35:34.868 align:start position:0%
2018 legislation and then the 12 months
subsequent

06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
06:35:38.310 --> 06:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
to that legislation being enacted
 
06:35:41.030 --> 06:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
and what we found is that even though
 
06:35:42.708 --> 06:35:42.718 align:start position:0%
subsequent to the bail reform
 
06:35:44.868 --> 06:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
legislation being enacted we saw a
 
06:35:47.030 --> 06:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
decrease a five percent decrease in
 
06:35:47.040 --> 06:35:48.230 align:start position:0%
decrease a five percent decrease in
arrests

06:35:48.230 --> 06:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
arrests
 
06:35:51.110 --> 06:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
we saw a 20 increase
 
06:35:52.868 --> 06:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh in arrests by offenders who were
 
06:35:54.868 --> 06:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
already out on bail
 
06:35:54.878 --> 06:35:55.830 align:start position:0%
already out on bail
so

06:35:55.830 --> 06:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's a local figure that's a
 
06:36:02.548 --> 06:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:04.070 --> 06:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
06:36:05.910 --> 06:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:36:08.468 --> 06:36:08.478 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
06:36:10.150 --> 06:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
um it might take me a minute to figure
 
06:36:12.468 --> 06:36:12.478 align:start position:0%
out how to ask this but
 
06:36:12.478 --> 06:36:13.270 align:start position:0%
out how to ask this but
um

06:36:13.270 --> 06:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:15.590 --> 06:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to hear these cases
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a rep from concord and i have talked
 
06:36:19.910 --> 06:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
to at least the former police chief and
 
06:36:22.548 --> 06:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
current officers about this
 
06:36:25.430 --> 06:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
and um obviously
 
06:36:27.910 --> 06:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
if it can be improved the existing law
 
06:36:30.390 --> 06:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
it should be but i have two very
 
06:36:30.400 --> 06:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
it should be but i have two very
different

06:36:31.430 --> 06:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:36:34.468 --> 06:36:34.478 align:start position:0%
questions the first is following up on
 
06:36:36.390 --> 06:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
what the representative from goffstown
 
06:36:36.400 --> 06:36:38.230 align:start position:0%
what the representative from goffstown
asked

06:36:38.230 --> 06:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
asked
 
06:36:38.240 --> 06:36:41.190 align:start position:0%
asked
if

06:36:41.190 --> 06:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:42.868 --> 06:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
06:36:45.350 --> 06:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
is what the law
 
06:36:47.350 --> 06:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
says we shouldn't be doing
 
06:36:49.430 --> 06:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the cases that you mentioned you know
 
06:36:52.150 --> 06:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i get it on a case-by-case basis
 
06:36:54.548 --> 06:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh it differs but
 
06:36:54.558 --> 06:36:55.430 align:start position:0%
uh it differs but
um

06:36:55.430 --> 06:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:57.590 --> 06:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't the problem actually be
 
06:36:59.670 --> 06:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
with the bail commissioners themselves
 
06:37:02.230 --> 06:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
not the existing law
 
06:37:03.750 --> 06:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
and then i have a follow-up that's a
 
06:37:03.760 --> 06:37:05.030 align:start position:0%
and then i have a follow-up that's a
different

06:37:05.030 --> 06:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:37:05.040 --> 06:37:07.190 align:start position:0%
different
topic

06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
topic
 
06:37:09.110 --> 06:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
well again based on the previous
 
06:37:12.868 --> 06:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard that you know the
 
06:37:14.230 --> 06:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners are human beings
 
06:37:16.788 --> 06:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
they're they're not infallible so errors
 
06:37:17.990 --> 06:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
are made
 
06:37:19.590 --> 06:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
and sometimes errors are made to the
 
06:37:21.590 --> 06:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
detriment of public safety
 
06:37:23.350 --> 06:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i mean we're
 
06:37:25.670 --> 06:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that in every crime
 
06:37:27.190 --> 06:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners should be taken out
 
06:37:29.750 --> 06:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
of it it's it's very the the the
 
06:37:33.430 --> 06:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation in 294 the proposed
 
06:37:36.628 --> 06:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
language is very specific for these
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
types of crimes the worst of the worst
 
06:37:40.948 --> 06:37:40.958 align:start position:0%
that's when we want to take the bail
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner out of the mix and bring
 
06:37:46.070 --> 06:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
the defendant before a judge when the
 
06:37:49.030 --> 06:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
judge has the full report the full facts
 
06:37:51.030 --> 06:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
being presented by the state
 
06:37:53.350 --> 06:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
to to take into consideration before
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
they make that determination
 
06:37:57.430 --> 06:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
06:37:59.350 --> 06:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question it does
 
06:38:01.270 --> 06:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
to a degree i think there's just a piece
 
06:38:02.708 --> 06:38:02.718 align:start position:0%
of this that
 
06:38:05.510 --> 06:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion needs more exploration but
 
06:38:07.910 --> 06:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
 
06:38:11.190 --> 06:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the separate issue
 
06:38:14.150 --> 06:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
as i asked it of others who testified
 
06:38:14.160 --> 06:38:15.110 align:start position:0%
as i asked it of others who testified
today

06:38:15.110 --> 06:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:38:18.230 --> 06:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:20.468 --> 06:38:20.478 align:start position:0%
lines one through three
 
06:38:24.468 --> 06:38:24.478 align:start position:0%
that's the uh no more than 72 hours at
 
06:38:26.230 --> 06:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
the time of their his or her arrest
 
06:38:29.670 --> 06:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
excluding saturday sundays and holidays
 
06:38:32.310 --> 06:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion around that piece has
 
06:38:34.468 --> 06:38:34.478 align:start position:0%
centered around with previous folks
 
06:38:34.478 --> 06:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
centered around with previous folks
testifying

06:38:35.910 --> 06:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
06:38:39.350 --> 06:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
around this the scenarios that um
 
06:38:42.708 --> 06:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
on that and a subsequent portion
 
06:38:45.510 --> 06:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the intervening circumstances that
 
06:38:48.070 --> 06:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
a person might be encountering separate
 
06:38:50.230 --> 06:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
from the anyone that i think we would
 
06:38:51.670 --> 06:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
all agree
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
violent criminals
 
06:38:53.520 --> 06:38:54.948 align:start position:0%
violent criminals
or

06:38:54.948 --> 06:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:38:57.510 --> 06:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh alleged criminals
 
06:38:57.520 --> 06:38:58.548 align:start position:0%
uh alleged criminals
uh

06:38:58.548 --> 06:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:39:01.110 --> 06:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't be released i mean i
 
06:39:03.110 --> 06:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that's happening
 
06:39:03.120 --> 06:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that's happening
but

06:39:05.030 --> 06:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:39:07.350 --> 06:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
but for those that are not committing
 
06:39:09.990 --> 06:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
violent offenses
 
06:39:15.350 --> 06:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:18.468 --> 06:39:18.478 align:start position:0%
are problematic especially when
 
06:39:20.708 --> 06:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
our social safety net
 
06:39:23.510 --> 06:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
is broken and i
 
06:39:25.750 --> 06:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize i i get that i'm sort of
 
06:39:27.830 --> 06:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
testifying i don't mean to do that um
 
06:39:30.468 --> 06:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
but i'm thinking of my conversation with
 
06:39:32.708 --> 06:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
concord police
 
06:39:35.350 --> 06:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
the one thing i know
 
06:39:38.070 --> 06:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree on is that law
 
06:39:40.708 --> 06:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
enforcement addressing social problems
 
06:39:40.718 --> 06:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
enforcement addressing social problems
like

06:39:41.750 --> 06:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:39:43.670 --> 06:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
people who don't have a home
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
or place to stay
 
06:39:46.708 --> 06:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
child care employment
 
06:39:49.030 --> 06:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
i know there's a question coming yes the
 
06:39:52.468 --> 06:39:52.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:52.478 --> 06:39:54.150 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:39:54.150 --> 06:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:39:56.310 --> 06:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say
 
06:40:00.628 --> 06:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
looking to our police officers to solve
 
06:40:02.628 --> 06:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
those issues
 
06:40:05.750 --> 06:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know including addiction
 
06:40:05.760 --> 06:40:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh you know including addiction
um

06:40:09.590 --> 06:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:11.190 --> 06:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you say
 
06:40:12.390 --> 06:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
there are other
 
06:40:15.590 --> 06:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
ways for society to address that
 
06:40:17.990 --> 06:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
than through law enforcement and that
 
06:40:22.230 --> 06:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:23.830 --> 06:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
something that we continue to keep at
 
06:40:26.788 --> 06:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
the forefront of this conversation
 
06:40:28.868 --> 06:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
of why
 
06:40:28.878 --> 06:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
of why
perhaps

06:40:29.910 --> 06:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
06:40:33.830 --> 06:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
bail reform has been needed all along
 
06:40:35.670 --> 06:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
i forgive
 
06:40:37.270 --> 06:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
when you got to the question
 
06:40:38.948 --> 06:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
when you got to the question there was
 
06:40:40.868 --> 06:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
about four questions in there i
 
06:40:40.878 --> 06:40:42.310 align:start position:0%
about four questions in there i
apologize

06:40:42.310 --> 06:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
06:40:43.830 --> 06:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
we sometimes refer that as a compound
 
06:40:43.840 --> 06:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
we sometimes refer that as a compound
question

06:40:45.110 --> 06:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:40:46.708 --> 06:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
so i think you know what i'm getting at
 
06:40:48.548 --> 06:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
but mr chair you've been amazing the
 
06:40:50.948 --> 06:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
good news is being here as a substitute
 
06:40:52.788 --> 06:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
he's letting me speak it's amazing the
 
06:40:54.230 --> 06:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
good news is there's two witnesses to
 
06:40:56.150 --> 06:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to answer
 
06:40:57.830 --> 06:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that was and then let me get my
 
06:40:57.840 --> 06:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
whatever that was and then let me get my
20-point

06:40:59.270 --> 06:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
20-point
 
06:41:00.868 --> 06:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh powerpoint
 
06:41:03.270 --> 06:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
i think you know what i'm asking
 
06:41:06.230 --> 06:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chair answer the question
 
06:41:08.230 --> 06:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
do your best i think the best word i can
 
06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
probably answer uh
 
06:41:11.910 --> 06:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
your question with is balance right
 
06:41:13.830 --> 06:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
there's balance and everything and we
 
06:41:15.670 --> 06:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
certainly want to balance the needs of
 
06:41:19.030 --> 06:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
public safety but knowing full well
 
06:41:20.628 --> 06:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
that there are folks that need help that
 
06:41:22.868 --> 06:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
we can't provide to them just because
 
06:41:24.390 --> 06:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
it's beyond our means
 
06:41:27.190 --> 06:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
and so um i'm not sure how that relates
 
06:41:28.150 --> 06:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
i i
 
06:41:30.390 --> 06:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
you know to bail in in this specific
 
06:41:32.548 --> 06:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
amendment but i certainly think you know
 
06:41:34.230 --> 06:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
it's a relevant point and it's one that
 
06:41:35.910 --> 06:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
we need to consider i mean the previous
 
06:41:37.590 --> 06:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
folks that have spoken about
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh this issue have spoken about you know
 
06:41:43.270 --> 06:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
society's approach to crime
 
06:41:45.030 --> 06:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a deeper issue that i can't
 
06:41:47.510 --> 06:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
answer here and we can't answer here in
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
five or ten minutes so
 
06:41:51.590 --> 06:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
point well taking them thank you very
 
06:41:53.910 --> 06:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
much and again i
 
06:41:55.670 --> 06:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
the chair has been amazing and generous
 
06:41:58.708 --> 06:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:00.548 --> 06:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:42:02.070 --> 06:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative calmly
 
06:42:04.788 --> 06:42:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh to
 
06:42:06.708 --> 06:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
you both for your testimony and not to
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
jump on my colleague from concord but
 
06:42:11.190 --> 06:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anyone who's been
 
06:42:11.200 --> 06:42:12.230 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anyone who's been
charged

06:42:12.230 --> 06:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
charged
 
06:42:15.030 --> 06:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
with a uh charged with being addicted to
 
06:42:18.230 --> 06:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
drugs or charged with being homeless
 
06:42:20.548 --> 06:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
those aren't crimes that i'm aware of so
 
06:42:22.468 --> 06:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
people who are arrested are accused of
 
06:42:24.150 --> 06:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
crimes or are they not
 
06:42:24.160 --> 06:42:25.110 align:start position:0%
crimes or are they not
and

06:42:25.110 --> 06:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:42:26.788 --> 06:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just want to clarify
 
06:42:31.110 --> 06:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:38.948 --> 06:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:40.310 --> 06:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you mr chair and
 
06:42:42.788 --> 06:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um i
 
06:42:44.830 --> 06:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
asked this of an earlier
 
06:42:47.430 --> 06:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
um an earlier
 
06:42:49.350 --> 06:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
person was satisfying but so what
 
06:42:51.430 --> 06:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
happens to folks who you know
 
06:42:52.868 --> 06:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
i understand you all have a really
 
06:42:54.628 --> 06:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
difficult job
 
06:42:56.230 --> 06:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
making sure you keep the public safe but
 
06:42:57.590 --> 06:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
what happens when
 
06:43:00.628 --> 06:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
someone is is arrested and they're
 
06:43:00.638 --> 06:43:01.430 align:start position:0%
someone is is arrested and they're
uh

06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:43:02.788 --> 06:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
they're and they're held and then
 
06:43:04.150 --> 06:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
they're proven that they're actually
 
06:43:06.468 --> 06:43:06.478 align:start position:0%
innocent is there any compensation or
 
06:43:08.070 --> 06:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
what happens to that person because you
 
06:43:10.390 --> 06:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
know obviously being being held is a
 
06:43:12.310 --> 06:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
very traumatic you know incident for
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
them especially if they're held
 
06:43:13.680 --> 06:43:15.350 align:start position:0%
them especially if they're held
innocently

06:43:15.350 --> 06:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
innocently
 
06:43:17.590 --> 06:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
sure i i think you asked that to the
 
06:43:20.310 --> 06:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative from the aclu and i think
 
06:43:21.750 --> 06:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
those are handled
 
06:43:24.070 --> 06:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else i'm not sure but um
 
06:43:25.750 --> 06:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
obviously those are handled on a case by
 
06:43:27.670 --> 06:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
case basis really what we're here to
 
06:43:30.548 --> 06:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
talk about is bail um we're
 
06:43:32.150 --> 06:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know with bail we're not presuming
 
06:43:34.468 --> 06:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
anyone's guilty of a crime we're
 
06:43:36.628 --> 06:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that in circum certain
 
06:43:36.638 --> 06:43:39.190 align:start position:0%
we're just saying that in circum certain
circumstances

06:43:39.190 --> 06:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
06:43:40.390 --> 06:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
06:43:42.628 --> 06:43:42.638 align:start position:0%
instances where we feel it's appropriate
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
that those specific cases be heard
 
06:43:46.310 --> 06:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
before a judge to make a determination
 
06:43:49.430 --> 06:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
on bail not guilt or innocence
 
06:43:55.510 --> 06:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:59.830 --> 06:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:01.350 --> 06:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:44:04.390 --> 06:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to the the list of
 
06:44:08.070 --> 06:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
crimes in line 26 through line 3 on page
 
06:44:08.080 --> 06:44:10.868 align:start position:0%
crimes in line 26 through line 3 on page
2.

06:44:10.868 --> 06:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
2.
 
06:44:13.990 --> 06:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it says upon arrest shall be
 
06:44:15.350 --> 06:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
be detained for a period of not more
 
06:44:17.030 --> 06:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
than 72 hours from the time of his or
 
06:44:18.468 --> 06:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
her arrest excluding saudi sunday's
 
06:44:20.070 --> 06:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
holidays except
 
06:44:20.080 --> 06:44:21.670 align:start position:0%
holidays except
also

06:44:21.670 --> 06:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:44:23.110 --> 06:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
based upon the
 
06:44:25.750 --> 06:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of a person
 
06:44:25.760 --> 06:44:27.670 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption of a person
charged

06:44:27.670 --> 06:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
charged
 
06:44:31.110 --> 06:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.070 --> 06:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i agree i i agree with that for the
 
06:44:36.070 --> 06:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
major crimes that you all said that have
 
06:44:38.788 --> 06:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
been carefully carved out
 
06:44:41.030 --> 06:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
but then as we go down in the paragraph
 
06:44:44.788 --> 06:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
and we go down to line 25
 
06:44:46.708 --> 06:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
and it says
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
and the person shall be detained in
 
06:44:52.230 --> 06:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
pre-trial detention
 
06:44:54.708 --> 06:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
to me that eliminates the bio the bail
 
06:44:56.948 --> 06:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
commissioners who are part of the court
 
06:44:56.958 --> 06:44:57.990 align:start position:0%
commissioners who are part of the court
as

06:44:57.990 --> 06:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:45:01.350 --> 06:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
amended on page one it says it says the
 
06:45:04.230 --> 06:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
court shall be judges in in
 
06:45:06.310 --> 06:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners
 
06:45:08.230 --> 06:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
so this bill the way it's worded right
 
06:45:08.240 --> 06:45:09.190 align:start position:0%
so this bill the way it's worded right
now

06:45:09.190 --> 06:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:45:12.548 --> 06:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
says there is a rebuttable
 
06:45:12.558 --> 06:45:14.628 align:start position:0%
says there is a rebuttable
presumption

06:45:14.628 --> 06:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
06:45:16.390 --> 06:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then it says but they shall be
 
06:45:16.400 --> 06:45:17.910 align:start position:0%
and then it says but they shall be
detained

06:45:17.910 --> 06:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
detained
 
06:45:19.990 --> 06:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that means that the person does not
 
06:45:23.190 --> 06:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
get a chance to rebut that
 
06:45:26.230 --> 06:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
and unless he sees a judge
 
06:45:28.628 --> 06:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
he just cannot see the judge
 
06:45:31.750 --> 06:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
it has to go to a judge
 
06:45:33.670 --> 06:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why i have a problem where
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
there is a presumption that they're
 
06:45:35.280 --> 06:45:36.548 align:start position:0%
there is a presumption that they're
guilty

06:45:36.548 --> 06:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
guilty
 
06:45:38.070 --> 06:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
even they've only been charged with a
 
06:45:38.080 --> 06:45:39.350 align:start position:0%
even they've only been charged with a
crime

06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
crime
 
06:45:41.990 --> 06:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then when the shell comes in it says
 
06:45:45.510 --> 06:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
you you don't have that anymore which
 
06:45:47.270 --> 06:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think exactly right maybe you're
 
06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
confused about that
 
06:45:52.150 --> 06:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
am i obviously confused about that
 
06:45:54.070 --> 06:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
if i may real quick i i think there is a
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
solution to that if uh
 
06:45:57.910 --> 06:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
if we may
 
06:45:59.830 --> 06:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
and possibly through an amended version
 
06:45:59.840 --> 06:46:00.548 align:start position:0%
and possibly through an amended version
of

06:46:00.548 --> 06:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:46:04.070 --> 06:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the bill if we can work on that part
 
06:46:06.948 --> 06:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
i i don't necessarily think that's
 
06:46:06.958 --> 06:46:08.788 align:start position:0%
i i don't necessarily think that's
um

06:46:08.788 --> 06:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:12.230 --> 06:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
the case in the circumstance i think the
 
06:46:14.070 --> 06:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
rebuttable presumption would would
 
06:46:15.670 --> 06:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
assume that the person be held until
 
06:46:22.548 --> 06:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:24.150 --> 06:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
well let me
 
06:46:26.708 --> 06:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll get there uh represent
 
06:46:31.110 --> 06:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
bournemouth and then okay
 
06:46:32.868 --> 06:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you for
 
06:46:34.390 --> 06:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:46:34.400 --> 06:46:35.190 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:35.200 --> 06:46:35.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

06:46:35.990 --> 06:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:37.750 --> 06:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
presumption seems to be in this bill
 
06:46:37.760 --> 06:46:39.750 align:start position:0%
presumption seems to be in this bill
that

06:46:39.750 --> 06:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:46:41.990 --> 06:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
bill commissioners are making mistakes
 
06:46:44.868 --> 06:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
in their detention hearings
 
06:46:44.878 --> 06:46:45.990 align:start position:0%
in their detention hearings
um

06:46:45.990 --> 06:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:47.750 --> 06:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
do judges make the mistakes in their
 
06:46:51.190 --> 06:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:54.390 --> 06:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
well again sir um respectfully
 
06:46:54.400 --> 06:46:55.110 align:start position:0%
well again sir um respectfully
the

06:46:55.110 --> 06:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:46:56.788 --> 06:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
judges are human beings
 
06:46:58.948 --> 06:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
but the um what this
 
06:47:00.948 --> 06:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
what this proposed language in the bill
 
06:47:03.990 --> 06:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
is trying to address is um
 
06:47:05.430 --> 06:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes
 
06:47:07.350 --> 06:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner is making a
 
06:47:09.030 --> 06:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
decision with less than all of the
 
06:47:11.590 --> 06:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
information whereas a judge
 
06:47:13.910 --> 06:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
with their high degree of legal training
 
06:47:15.750 --> 06:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
and now they have a full set of facts
 
06:47:17.190 --> 06:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
before them with all the reports
 
06:47:17.200 --> 06:47:18.390 align:start position:0%
before them with all the reports
completed

06:47:18.390 --> 06:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
completed
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
and having a prosecutor be able to argue
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
the points in those reports and in the
 
06:47:24.788 --> 06:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
affidavit that a
 
06:47:27.430 --> 06:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
you're improving the likelihood that
 
06:47:29.510 --> 06:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a more appropriate
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
bail i mean no cis there's no guarantee
 
06:47:33.910 --> 06:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
to anything right i mean human you know
 
06:47:36.390 --> 06:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
judges are human so yeah could a judge
 
06:47:38.310 --> 06:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
make a bad decision absolutely i mean
 
06:47:41.430 --> 06:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
any of us could right um but it just it
 
06:47:43.990 --> 06:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
gives the entire system
 
06:47:45.510 --> 06:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
more time
 
06:47:47.270 --> 06:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
to um
 
06:47:49.990 --> 06:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
take full account of what has transpired
 
06:47:52.628 --> 06:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
in these 13 enumerated
 
06:47:55.990 --> 06:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
worst of the worst crimes
 
06:47:58.708 --> 06:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question sir
 
06:48:01.190 --> 06:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you it does partially
 
06:48:01.200 --> 06:48:02.468 align:start position:0%
uh thank you it does partially
um

06:48:02.468 --> 06:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
but already the the law
 
06:48:08.948 --> 06:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
allows us to retain people that are
 
06:48:11.030 --> 06:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
a danger to themselves or the general
 
06:48:13.910 --> 06:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
public without mentioning what crimes
 
06:48:15.270 --> 06:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
06:48:18.468 --> 06:48:18.478 align:start position:0%
being charged with and if i
 
06:48:19.750 --> 06:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see
 
06:48:23.110 --> 06:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
in on this list terrorism as a
 
06:48:25.190 --> 06:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
possible crime for
 
06:48:25.200 --> 06:48:28.468 align:start position:0%
possible crime for
retention

06:48:28.468 --> 06:48:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.270 --> 06:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
and so that means that even that is a
 
06:48:34.230 --> 06:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
serious crime and a
 
06:48:36.708 --> 06:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
danger to the public then
 
06:48:39.030 --> 06:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
they should get a hearing before a bail
 
06:48:39.040 --> 06:48:42.150 align:start position:0%
they should get a hearing before a bail
commissioner

06:48:42.150 --> 06:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm not going to disagree with
 
06:48:47.910 --> 06:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:53.270 --> 06:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps this list of crimes is is
 
06:48:58.468 --> 06:48:58.478 align:start position:0%
is is really something that we shouldn't
 
06:49:01.430 --> 06:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
be doing we should be just looking and
 
06:49:03.910 --> 06:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
using our judgment to determine what is
 
06:49:06.868 --> 06:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
a serious crime and what is serious
 
06:49:06.878 --> 06:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
a serious crime and what is serious
uh

06:49:08.150 --> 06:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:49:10.628 --> 06:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
concern for for person safety are the
 
06:49:14.070 --> 06:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:16.390 --> 06:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
i i would submit respectfully sir that
 
06:49:17.750 --> 06:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we're all attempting to do
 
06:49:20.628 --> 06:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
collectively here is determine what is
 
06:49:22.948 --> 06:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
serious and what should
 
06:49:24.948 --> 06:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
um go before a judge rather than a bail
 
06:49:24.958 --> 06:49:26.070 align:start position:0%
um go before a judge rather than a bail
commissioner

06:49:26.070 --> 06:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
06:49:27.670 --> 06:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's i think we're all trying to do
 
06:49:27.680 --> 06:49:28.708 align:start position:0%
that's i think we're all trying to do
that

06:49:28.708 --> 06:49:28.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:49:30.830 --> 06:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
at with
 
06:49:33.750 --> 06:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
294. uh thank you
 
06:49:36.150 --> 06:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative bourne if i can is there
 
06:49:39.190 --> 06:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
a rsa that defines or
 
06:49:41.990 --> 06:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
the crime of terrorism
 
06:49:44.150 --> 06:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
that anyone's aware of uh mr chairman i
 
06:49:47.430 --> 06:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that we have a a uh
 
06:49:51.030 --> 06:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
rsa that they uh describes terrorism but
 
06:49:54.628 --> 06:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh you would admit that if someone was
 
06:49:57.270 --> 06:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
to commit a cri a
 
06:50:00.708 --> 06:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
event of terrorism that it would be uh
 
06:50:00.718 --> 06:50:02.788 align:start position:0%
event of terrorism that it would be uh
serious

06:50:02.788 --> 06:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
serious
 
06:50:04.868 --> 06:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
i would most certainly agree with that
 
06:50:06.468 --> 06:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
and i would be shocked if someone did
 
06:50:08.788 --> 06:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
not agree with that
 
06:50:10.390 --> 06:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
almost chairman do we need to have an
 
06:50:12.628 --> 06:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
rsa to define terrorism i'm willing to
 
06:50:15.990 --> 06:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
work on that with you thank you
 
06:50:20.070 --> 06:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:21.830 --> 06:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right mr chair i just want to take a
 
06:50:24.070 --> 06:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
point of personal privilege right well
 
06:50:26.310 --> 06:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
okay i gotta hey we're gonna let
 
06:50:31.510 --> 06:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:34.390 --> 06:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
well this is a quick question um you
 
06:50:35.830 --> 06:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
i believe it was
 
06:50:37.510 --> 06:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
um i forget your name but from
 
06:50:40.230 --> 06:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
manchester you mentioned that
 
06:50:41.670 --> 06:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
the person had
 
06:50:43.910 --> 06:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
was bailed out before your officer
 
06:50:47.590 --> 06:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
completed his um his report
 
06:50:47.600 --> 06:50:48.868 align:start position:0%
completed his um his report
correct

06:50:48.868 --> 06:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:50:51.510 --> 06:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes that does happen ma'am so
 
06:50:53.990 --> 06:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
how does the how did the bill's been
 
06:50:56.468 --> 06:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
i think i'm missing a process or maybe
 
06:50:58.708 --> 06:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
the process is off
 
06:51:00.868 --> 06:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
that that could happen
 
06:51:03.590 --> 06:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
typically when the reports are not done
 
06:51:05.590 --> 06:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner will speak with
 
06:51:07.750 --> 06:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
the arresting officer and the arresting
 
06:51:09.350 --> 06:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
officer will to the best of their
 
06:51:11.750 --> 06:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
ability to come convey all the facts of
 
06:51:13.590 --> 06:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
the case so that they can make a
 
06:51:15.350 --> 06:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
decision so the report may not be
 
06:51:17.590 --> 06:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
completed but there is a verbal exchange
 
06:51:19.830 --> 06:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
so they do have some information
 
06:51:19.840 --> 06:51:20.788 align:start position:0%
so they do have some information
um

06:51:20.788 --> 06:51:20.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:22.628 --> 06:51:22.638 align:start position:0%
the problem is obviously that's not
 
06:51:24.628 --> 06:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
that's an imperfect process right that's
 
06:51:26.390 --> 06:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to be that's going to be less
 
06:51:28.628 --> 06:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than a fully written
 
06:51:30.468 --> 06:51:30.478 align:start position:0%
report or affidavit
 
06:51:32.468 --> 06:51:32.478 align:start position:0%
so you know sometimes it's just a verbal
 
06:51:34.468 --> 06:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
exchange you know lasting maybe 10
 
06:51:34.478 --> 06:51:38.548 align:start position:0%
exchange you know lasting maybe 10
minutes

06:51:38.548 --> 06:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:40.868 --> 06:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
so um
 
06:51:42.230 --> 06:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
what if
 
06:51:44.708 --> 06:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
i guess if um
 
06:51:46.548 --> 06:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
have you ever had the cases yourself
 
06:51:49.110 --> 06:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
where you felt that the commissioner did
 
06:51:51.510 --> 06:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
not do his job correctly
 
06:51:53.510 --> 06:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so did you follow through with the
 
06:51:55.510 --> 06:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or with the courts or
 
06:51:56.868 --> 06:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
whatever you said would happen the very
 
06:51:57.990 --> 06:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
next day
 
06:51:59.670 --> 06:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
i think you mentioned
 
06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
ma'am not myself personally no um i i
 
06:52:05.270 --> 06:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
haven't been in the patrol division for
 
06:52:07.590 --> 06:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
for quite some time so i haven't
 
06:52:09.990 --> 06:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
personally experienced that but i have i
 
06:52:12.390 --> 06:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
have read the reports in which
 
06:52:14.788 --> 06:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
those types of incidents had occurred
 
06:52:16.708 --> 06:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
those instances have occurred okay so
 
06:52:18.230 --> 06:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
then they did file an appeal or
 
06:52:20.230 --> 06:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
something the next day or whenever that
 
06:52:22.708 --> 06:52:22.718 align:start position:0%
takes do you know what any of the um
 
06:52:24.310 --> 06:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
results were
 
06:52:25.910 --> 06:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i don't have any
 
06:52:27.910 --> 06:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
specifics i'm sorry yeah
 
06:52:27.920 --> 06:52:29.030 align:start position:0%
specifics i'm sorry yeah
well

06:52:29.030 --> 06:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:52:30.310 --> 06:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's very important
 
06:52:32.070 --> 06:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
information that i think we would need
 
06:52:34.390 --> 06:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
to know um because if you if you're
 
06:52:36.468 --> 06:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
saying that these people are releasing
 
06:52:38.310 --> 06:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
people and they shouldn't be
 
06:52:40.628 --> 06:52:40.638 align:start position:0%
okay and the law says that they
 
06:52:42.468 --> 06:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be released based on the
 
06:52:42.478 --> 06:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be released based on the
reading

06:52:43.430 --> 06:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
reading
 
06:52:45.670 --> 06:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
then i would seriously would like to
 
06:52:48.468 --> 06:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
know how often this happens that they're
 
06:52:51.510 --> 06:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
released like that and when you file the
 
06:52:53.590 --> 06:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
report i mean when you filed you know
 
06:52:55.270 --> 06:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
with the courts
 
06:52:56.868 --> 06:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
what they're what were the outcomes of
 
06:52:58.628 --> 06:52:58.638 align:start position:0%
it you know did they agree with you did
 
06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
something happen with the commissioner
 
06:53:01.510 --> 06:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:53:03.510 --> 06:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
i just feel as though
 
06:53:05.830 --> 06:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
we're hearing a lot about those types of
 
06:53:07.190 --> 06:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
things just want to have some type of
 
06:53:07.200 --> 06:53:08.868 align:start position:0%
things just want to have some type of
data

06:53:08.868 --> 06:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
data
 
06:53:11.030 --> 06:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and i'm not
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
i can't tell you for a fact that that
 
06:53:13.830 --> 06:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
date is definitely there but we can
 
06:53:15.590 --> 06:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
certainly make an attempt to look at
 
06:53:15.600 --> 06:53:19.110 align:start position:0%
certainly make an attempt to look at
that

06:53:19.110 --> 06:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
didn't i ask a question
 
06:53:23.910 --> 06:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:25.430 --> 06:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
06:53:28.468 --> 06:53:28.478 align:start position:0%
okay oh so you made me forget what my
 
06:53:33.910 --> 06:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:36.150 --> 06:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
i have to think now what's up my next
 
06:53:36.160 --> 06:53:37.830 align:start position:0%
i have to think now what's up my next
question

06:53:37.830 --> 06:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:53:38.868 --> 06:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
when any of the members are saying are
 
06:53:40.708 --> 06:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
offensive we just was
 
06:53:42.070 --> 06:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to ask a question of the
 
06:53:43.350 --> 06:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
witness we can when we talk amongst
 
06:53:44.948 --> 06:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
ourselves in the work session or
 
06:53:47.430 --> 06:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
executive says different but
 
06:53:49.670 --> 06:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
going forward and do a better job as a
 
06:53:53.750 --> 06:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair to try to be stricter with that
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:12.548 --> 06:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
06:54:14.230 --> 06:54:14.240 align:start position:0%

06:54:48.948 --> 06:54:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:51.350 --> 06:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls kate horgan

06:54:57.600 --> 06:54:58.468 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:55:02.070 --> 06:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:03.670 --> 06:55:03.680 align:start position:0%

06:55:18.868 --> 06:55:18.878 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
06:55:18.878 --> 06:55:21.190 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
and

06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:22.708 --> 06:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
you wish to
 
06:55:22.718 --> 06:55:26.948 align:start position:0%
you wish to
address

06:55:26.948 --> 06:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:28.548 --> 06:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
we're not going to execute this bill
 
06:55:34.468 --> 06:55:34.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:34.478 --> 06:55:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
mr

06:55:35.510 --> 06:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
mr
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just wanted to make the point
 
06:55:41.590 --> 06:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
since um
 
06:55:43.110 --> 06:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
my points
 
06:55:45.670 --> 06:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
were challenged in a question to the
 
06:55:47.830 --> 06:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
previous folks testifying
 
06:55:51.590 --> 06:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
as a concord rep
 
06:55:53.910 --> 06:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
it is clear to me
 
06:55:53.920 --> 06:55:54.868 align:start position:0%
it is clear to me
that

06:55:54.868 --> 06:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:55:56.708 --> 06:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
the state hospital
 
06:56:01.030 --> 06:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
the men's prison the women's prison all
 
06:56:03.110 --> 06:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
discharging folks
 
06:56:04.548 --> 06:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
06:56:06.628 --> 06:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
there certainly are a number of issues
 
06:56:08.948 --> 06:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
that concord faces that maybe every
 
06:56:10.468 --> 06:56:10.478 align:start position:0%
other town and city of new hampshire
 
06:56:12.390 --> 06:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand
 
06:56:15.270 --> 06:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
but i'll also say it's rather unique
 
06:56:17.350 --> 06:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
when the points i raised get the
 
06:56:19.670 --> 06:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
agreement of the aclu
 
06:56:22.548 --> 06:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
and americans for prosperity
 
06:56:24.868 --> 06:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
thank you that's it point of personal
 
06:56:28.070 --> 06:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
privilege that's not about me
 
06:56:30.310 --> 06:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
those they those organizations agree on
 
06:56:58.868 --> 06:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:02.868 --> 06:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:02.878 --> 06:57:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:57:04.150 --> 06:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:57:07.350 --> 06:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
the the side-by-side worksheet and i
 
06:57:08.788 --> 06:57:08.798 align:start position:0%
this is going to be this bill will be
 
06:57:11.270 --> 06:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a work session on next
 
06:57:11.280 --> 06:57:12.708 align:start position:0%
scheduled for a work session on next
wednesday

06:57:12.708 --> 06:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
06:57:17.750 --> 06:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:19.590 --> 06:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
06:57:21.750 --> 06:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i would just go through
 
06:57:22.868 --> 06:57:22.878 align:start position:0%
that worksheet and kind of see the
 
06:57:24.468 --> 06:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
differences between what we passed in
 
06:57:27.030 --> 06:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
this committee as an amendment to what
 
06:57:30.708 --> 06:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
the we have now with senate bill 294.
 
06:57:30.718 --> 06:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
the we have now with senate bill 294.
and

06:57:31.510 --> 06:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:57:33.430 --> 06:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't my opinion a significant
 
06:57:34.788 --> 06:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
difference especially with the first
 
06:57:37.670 --> 06:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
section involving the list of crimes
 
06:57:38.868 --> 06:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
and then if there's any issues with the
 
06:57:40.150 --> 06:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
list of crimes that are on there whether
 
06:57:42.468 --> 06:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
something should be added
 
06:57:43.990 --> 06:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
or removed
 
06:57:54.788 --> 06:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:57.990 --> 06:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
but at this time i think we you know
 
06:58:00.628 --> 06:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
well now uh the committee will
 
06:58:00.638 --> 06:58:03.990 align:start position:0%
well now uh the committee will
well

06:58:03.990 --> 06:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:07.830 --> 06:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
so close yes if i may i did find on my
 
06:58:12.070 --> 06:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
table here uh senate bill 401

and health and human services is that
 
06:58:16.070 --> 06:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
something we're looking at
 
06:58:17.750 --> 06:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think that was a mistake that's not
 
06:58:17.760 --> 06:58:18.868 align:start position:0%
i think that was a mistake that's not
today
