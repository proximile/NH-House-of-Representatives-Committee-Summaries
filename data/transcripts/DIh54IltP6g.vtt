representative L has s has suggested
 
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
that we take up the solid waste program
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
rules first and she has a motion
 
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you I would um I would
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
move a preliminary objection on um the
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
rule FP 2024 74 four
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
second do you wish to speak to your
 
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes thank you madam chair we
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
have received uh very very large amount
 
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
of testimony raising questions with this
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
rule uh there are questions that were
 
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
raised both about the specifics and how
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
it relates to the safety that's done not
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
just in this country but around the
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
world um there's a question of how it
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
relates to the existing rules as well we
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
have also heard questions about the
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
process and which voices have been heard
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
how it's been recognized and uh
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
basically how public input has or has
 
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
not been listened to so I believe that
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some more work to make
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
sure that all of the concerned voices
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
are heard and that we understand exactly
 
00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 align:start position:0%
what this rural change will mean not
 
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
just for our landfills but for the
 
00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire um and so more
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
specifically um we can object BEC about
 
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
on the condition of this being contrary
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
to the public interest about not being
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
responsive to the public need uh we have
 
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
received a decent amount of testimony
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
that suggests that
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure if I if I need to
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
run through all the different issues on
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
the preliminary objection you need to
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
explain the reasons for the preliminary
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
objection and that's it okay thank
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to comment that the
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
um there was vast amounts of content of
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
comment and the explanations on how it
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
was addressed
 
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 align:start position:0%
are extremely technical and I it didn't
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
seem to me that the many of the
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
commenters who came back and complained
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
about the rule really understood what
 
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.830 align:start position:0%
about the rule really understood what
the

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
U um what the what the how the comments
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
were actually addressed yeah there's
 
00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
also the issue that the these rules are
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
much more protective than the existing
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
rules which have been extended for as
 
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
long as we're in rul making and are what
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
is now now currently being used to
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
evaluate I believe it's two
 
00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.189 align:start position:0%
evaluate I believe it's two
landfill

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
um landfill
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
applications and if we drag this out any
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
much further it's possible that the
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
landfills in question might be approved
 
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
on the 10-year-old rules rather than the
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
new rules which are more protective and
 
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that's what anybody
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
wants so I would I'm going to support
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
the objection and hope the agency can
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
come back with some more accessible
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
information Senator Greg um my only
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
question is from to the staff is if
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
there is anything else we need to wave
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
any of the deadlines or anything to
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish this no the preliminary
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
objection creates a 45-day period for
 
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
the agency to respond and after that
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
joker has a 50-day period to to respond
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
to that yes but I s the rules but after
 
00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
some discussions with the with other
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
people I think it's it's likely that
 
00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879 align:start position:0%
they would be able to come back with
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
some answers for our December meeting
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
and we could give it a fair shot and
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
that will also give give us a chance to
 
00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
read a bit more of the
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
testimony any other
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
comments just to be clear on the
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
objection so you are objecting um
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
according to public interest under Jael
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
car 4030 1 A2 and 40301
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
G uh yes and are you also objecting
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
under the legislative intent issue
 
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
surrounding the purpose statement yes I
 
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.430 align:start position:0%
surrounding the purpose statement yes I
am

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%

Whitley excuse
 
00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
me um thank you madam chair I'm
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
wondering if the committee wanted to
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
hear from members of the public who were
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
here I know this is an issue that people
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
care deeply about and I wonder if we
 
00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:31.959 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
hear the members of the public have
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
submitted large quantities of written
 
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:40.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that I don't believe much of
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
the committee has actually had a chance
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
to digest yet and we will if necessary
 
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
we'll talk to other people on the uh um
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
at the at the meeting when the agency
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
has their response we have heard enough
 
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
of the public testimony to be concerned
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
about the rules and that's why we're
 
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.509 align:start position:0%
about the rules and that's why we're
were

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
preliminarily object to
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
the uh landfill
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
rules the the 800 rules
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
and those in favor I I
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you very much and I'm
 
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
looking forward to getting a response
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.790 align:start position:0%
 
agency

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
education uh before we hear from the
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
staff on this I want to make it
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear that this is not a
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing we have received again
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
vast quantities of public testimony
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
which has been considered by both the
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
Education and I also noticed that on the
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
more recent submissions they were first
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
of all based
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
significantly on old versions of the
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
rules and they didn't reflect the
 
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
changes that had been made in response
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
to the first round of
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
comments um so I'm going going to say
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to hear duplicative
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we had over an hour of it a
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
month ago and I am not the least bit
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing the same things
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
over and over again except as the Board
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
of Education States how they changed the
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
rule in response to said
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
comments and so yes Senator gray uh I
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure that the public
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
knows that if there objection is to the
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
RSA and the rules accurately reflect
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
what is in the RSA that is not something
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
that this committee can do anything
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
about thank you yes I was getting on to
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
the next point which is we are not a
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
policy committee we can only observe the
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
policy as set in the statute and see how
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
the rules follow the statute if the if
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
the rules violate the statute that's
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
something we will talk about if they
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
support the statute but you but the
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
public has concerns with parts or all of
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
the statute that's not something we can
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
do anything with so we
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
and all right any other representative
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
Roa yes thank you Madame chair I also
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
like to say that if the rules violate
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
the statute or indicate the lack of
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
legislative intent those are things that
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
we would want to hear
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
about right but um if if they're
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
following the statute that's all we can
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
we can enforce we can't object to a rule
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
because we don't like the policy that
 
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature has adopted agree much
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
as we would like to sometimes but we
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
can't Madam chair yes yeah it's more
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
than just the statute we can object to
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
if the rules are contrary to public
 
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
interest I want to be clear about that
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
it's contrary to legislative intent and
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
contrary to the public interest PR so it
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
it it it it's a little broader than just
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
the statute well yes but
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh in in from some of the comments I was
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
getting the impression that there is a
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
policy dispute and that is not something
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
we should be taking up all right
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
so so we are looking at uh proposal 2024
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
41 this is called been called the first
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
half of the 306s it includes Ed
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
30601 to Ed
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
30626 this includes the minimum
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval and
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
I have no substantive comments on this
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
rule on October 29th um the legislative
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee of Education
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
Improvement and Assessment program voted
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
4 to two to recommend support of this
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
proposal with the contingency that the
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
term educator as defined is change to
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
the definition from RSA 21 n d oh sorry
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
21 in8
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
DC that definition of educator is um
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
educator means teacher or certified par
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
professional um I am looking at an
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval request
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
from the Department that includes that
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
change as recommended by the oversight
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
committee and so I have no further
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:28.279 align:start position:0%

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
need to
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Representatives Miler and
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
luno have some concerns about the
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
process and we'll give them a couple of
 
00:14:43.199 --> 00:15:00.269 align:start position:0%
process and we'll give them a couple of
minutes

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%

also
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
um so we can take them
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
together I believe that this is relative
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
to both of them so we'll they're there
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%

and Bo I come before you today to oppose
 
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
the process for the development of the
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
306 education rules that are before you
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
today I have been involved in New
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education policym for over 30
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
years I have served as the executive
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
director of Na New Hampshire for 21
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
years and for 12 years on the house
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
education committee as a ranking them
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
and chair I will address four concerns
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
one the historic role of the department
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
has played in the education policy and
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
Rule making two the contracted Services
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
of developing the proposed 306 rules
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
three the role of HB
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
1622 demanding the recog recognition of
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
Citizen input in rule making and for HB
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
1163 the role of the legislative
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee those are the four
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
areas I want to address first the
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has historically
 
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
actively engaged the education community
 
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:36.759 align:start position:0%
in the development of rules and policy
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
impacting students they have led the
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
engagement of members of school boards
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers in seeking
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
their input these are the professionals
 
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
that work day-to-day on implementing the
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
standards and the rules governing
 
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
education of our students for example
 
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
the policies related to teacher
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
evaluation and the educator ethics and
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
code of conduct actively brought
 
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
together by the department practitioners
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
in the field this historic role of
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
directly enlisting those in the field
 
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
did not happen in this current process
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
of the 306 rules second the granting of
 
00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:17.429 align:start position:0%
of the 306 rules second the granting of
the

00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
$75,000 contract to the National Center
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
for Competency Based learning violated
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
the historic engagement of school of the
 
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
school Community I have deep respect for
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
for the president of the
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
ncbl for his commitment to New Hampshire
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
education but the model used was flawed
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
he gathered a few representatives of the
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
education leadership and created a doc
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
initial document he then conducted a
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
series of events across the street
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
trying to share components of the draft
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
document the intent of the session was
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
to seek Community input but input never
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
was achieved I attended three sessions
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
there was an overview of the draft
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
document the document was not shared so
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
that the attendant the attendees did not
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to provide input or
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
reaction most of those attending were
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
School Personnel the result of was
 
00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
frustration because they lacked the
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
importance of the work being done the
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
important an opportunity for Vital input
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
was lost there was an 11th Hour attempt
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
to include some school advocates in the
 
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
review but it was a little little too
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
late and little the timing was wrong
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
third the last session of the
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
legislature demonstrated its commitment
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
to Citizen input on rule making both the
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house overrode the
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
governor's veto of HB
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
1622 in case you forgot what that action
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
was Let me refresh your
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
memory this is the quote from that law
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
quote item e a report of public comments
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
received on the rule shall be created
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
the report shall indicate how the
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
comment was incorporated into the final
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
rule if the comment was not incorporated
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
into the final rule the agency shall
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
provide a detailed explanation that
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
includes the facts data interpretation
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
and policy choices that justified why
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
the adopting agency did not not amend
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
the rules because of the flawed input
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
process as I noted above Christine
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
Downey who is here today to present her
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about the process she's an an
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
educator out of Goan she took it upon
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
herself to initiate an independent 306
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
review process you have received a
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
summary of her two-year work in
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
involving over 200 educated
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
practitioners her work represents the
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
historic role the department should have
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
played at the outset of the ru of the
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
process she has made multiple pre
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
presentations to the State Board of
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
Education she has been an advocate
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of those who
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
will Implement those rules when the
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education was asked at
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight session what
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
was the status of Dr Downey's work his
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
response was quote thank you for her
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
work end quote when pressed by a member
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
of the Comm committee he could not site
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the proposed document where
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Downing work was represented or
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
included fourth and finally the
 
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
education legislative oversight
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
committee's role has been totally
 
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
dismissed by the department again there
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
was clear legislative intent on the role
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the oversight Committee in in
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
reviewing and recommending
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
rules in an earlier session and in an
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
earlier session uh we adopted HB
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
1163 let me State what that says quote
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
review and make recommendations relating
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
to academic standards under the
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
consideration of the State Board of
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
Education pursuant to RSA 93e col
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
2-a and this is the new language and
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
approval under the consideration by the
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education pursuant to 93
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee held five
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
sessions because of the multiple drafts
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was difficult for them to receive the
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
final version the committee's
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
Legislative Assistant produced a side
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
by-side version the department presented
 
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
thems just one time to the committee in
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
those five sessions in the middle of
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
that session the department realized
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
that the committee had the wrong version
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the document and further they did not
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with the deart
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
Department reference documents that they
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
were working from there was confusion
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
subsequently the chair of the committee
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
met with commissioner seeking answers to
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
the question he had the committee
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
members had no further opportunity to
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
get answers to the questions they had
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
the lack of respect by the department
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
for the legislative process is a clear
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
violation of the legislative oversight
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
mandate for these four reasons I object
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
to the rules
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
the rules are very important and they
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
need revision the current rules have
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
established a sound educational system
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
for our students we we have continued to
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
rank number within the top five
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
nationally because of these rules these
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
rules have always included active
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
engagement of educational Personnel
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
finally how this committee deals with
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
the objections to those that are before
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
you is key to the president that you
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
will make in considering the future
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
rules coming before you clearly I
 
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
believe that the department has violated
 
00:23:08.909 --> 00:23:08.919 align:start position:0%
its historic role it's intent of
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
1622 and HP
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
1163 no State Department is exempt from
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
the role of the legislature thank you

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
authority to uh review and
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%

accountability and legislative oversight
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
committee received a 46-page proposal of
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
changes to what's known as the front
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
half of the rules over nearly two hours
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
the committee barely got through the
 
00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
first two pages of definitions and
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
general discussion was directed to
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
leaving the rules as is without any
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
changes at all excuse me what was the
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
date the preliminary that that
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
was that was on June 26 2024 all right
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
so so you met shortly after the
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
preliminary uh initial proposal was
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
issued corre correct is that correct
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you I just want to
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
make the timeline straight right right
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
so I I believe the preliminary proposal
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
I don't have it in front of me may have
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
been dated February 2024 so
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
um it was issued to the public in in
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
June okay in in that so so that that was
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly in work for quite a while
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
that lines up thank you y y please
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
continue so two months later on August
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
22nd 2024 the commissioner along with um
 
00:26:47.789 --> 00:26:47.799 align:start position:0%
the education Department's rule
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
administrator Julie Shay testified
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
before the committee during questioning
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
it was made clear by m that the
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee was provided with the
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
incorrect draft of the propos osed rules
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
and you can actually find that at uh 25
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
minutes 45 seconds into the um into the
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
meeting uh during the meeting the
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner avoided direct questions of
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
why the proposed rules specifically 22
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
and 23 were not considered to be changes
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
to academic standards the committee met
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
again October 17th
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
2024 uh again uh commissioner edbl and
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
miss Shay returned to the committee to
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
present the back half of the proposed
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
rule changes changes that clearly would
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
impact the academic standards meaning
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
what students should know at certain
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
grade levels in fact the the proposed
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
changes scrapped existing rules
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
pertinent to curriculum instruction and
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
assessment in each of the contact areas
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
required under statute RSA 193 e2a and
 
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
instead replace those rules with
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
references to curriculum Frameworks some
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
dating back more than two decades the
 
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
committee was not provided with nor did
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
it conduct any review of the referenced
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks that apparently
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
include academic
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
standards um shortly thereafter on
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
October 21st 2024 the committee reviewed
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules with respect to the
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
2018 report from The Joint legislative
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on costing of
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
inadequate education and uh I believe
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative Myer served on um uh on
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
that uh that committee um in that report
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
that legislative committee issued a
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
finding that the student student teacher
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
ratio quote necessary to provide the
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education in
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is 25 to1 in K2 and 30 to1
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
in grades 3- 12 this most recent
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is clearly in
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
Conflict to the proposed rules which
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate maximum class siiz standards
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
members uh had many questions specific
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
to the proposed rules both front and
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
back however the department was a
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
no-show at that meeting on October 29th
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
2024 so now we're just a week after that
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
last meeting the committee held a final
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
meeting to get our questions answered I
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
spoke with the chair before the meeting
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
and he told me that he had a private
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
meeting with the commissioner and that
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
his questions had been answered so I
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
asked the chair who's going to answer my
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
questions and his response was that the
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would have
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
someone present at that final meeting
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
that day to answer questions from the
 
00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.389 align:start position:0%
that day to answer questions from the
committee

00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
members however nobody from the
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
education department Department showed
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
up Department was not there to answer
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members and
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
I feel that not only failed me but
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
failed the thousands of constituents who
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
I represent in the legislature and for
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
that matter more than a million grandet
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
Staters who we all represent in summary
 
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education has not
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
provided members of the legislative
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
oversight committee with the correct
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
complete and accurate documents or
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
answers to questions necessary for the
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
committee to do it its job per the
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
statute and represent our constituents
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the videos of the meeting serve as
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.590 align:start position:0%

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
table uh if she needs that or something
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh open so that if there is a problem
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%

opportunity to respond the first point I
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
just want to get out of the way because
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
it keeps coming up is that the rules and
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate um classroom sizes that's not
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
true that's never been true um
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
the current rules as you see and 30614
 
00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.470 align:start position:0%
the current rules as you see and 30614
and

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
30612 keep uh in response to public
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
comment in response to the hearings and
 
00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:13.240 align:start position:0%
the input from Educators that you just
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
heard didn't happen which actually did
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
happen we
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
incorporated the current class size
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
limits into the rules so those do not
 
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
limits into the rules so those do not
change

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
and that just has to be clear
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
because we keep seeing this uh
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
misinformation this this
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
disinformation um circulated and it's
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
not true um we in the conversation about
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
class size rules in the initial proposal
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
we opened it up to conversation and I
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
made very clear in Board of Education
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
meetings that we were looking at ways to
 
00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
give districts some flexibility to
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
respond to to parents and respond to the
 
00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.310 align:start position:0%
respond to to parents and respond to the
post

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
post
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic and think about what
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
constitutes a classroom and how they
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
might configure that and so we thought
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
maybe we could do ratios of Educators to
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
students and we floated that idea and
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
the feedback we got was um we really
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
feel safer if you mandate that we have
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
class siiz caps so we inated the
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
existing class- siiz caps into the rule
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
and they are still there um would could
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
you uh point us to where they're showing
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
on the so 306
 
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.029 align:start position:0%
on the so 306
.14

00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
.14
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
30614 they are in there page 12 of the
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval request
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
page 12 yes all right and they've been
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
in there for a long time um so it's it's
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
simply not
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
true that we eliminated the class siiz
 
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.509 align:start position:0%
true that we eliminated the class siiz
caps

00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
um secondly uh this was the
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
longest rulemaking process uh to my
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge in State Board of Education
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
history it went on for um depending on
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
where you start the process three plus
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
years with the Contracting and the um
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearings and the input Fred Bon's
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
organization that was contracted to
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
begin this process collected input in
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
the draft process from
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
Educators when we
 
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
Educators when we
began

00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:39.399 align:start position:0%
the um official rule making
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
process it we went through um a very
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
extensive um some people have derided it
 
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
as a road show I don't know why you
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
would deride that we went we did 13
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
listening sessions around the state that
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
has never happened before in the history
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
of board education
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking we did 13 listening sessions
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
going to public schools around the
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
state advertised
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
noticed to get public input from the
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
public and from Educators and from you
 
00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:15.079 align:start position:0%
know all School
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and we listen to that
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
feedback that
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
feedback um really helped shape our
 
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
Draft rules Christine Downing who was
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned was tasked with
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing the Draft rules and giving us
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
feedback which we took a lot of
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
Christine's recommendations are
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated into these rules we gave
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
her over an hour if recollection servs
 
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
on the time maybe approximately an hour
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
at a public uh meeting of the Board of
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
Education to go over in public her last
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
round of recommendations in addition to
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that she was making
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
through the channels that were set up
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know outside of the public meetings
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
we had three public hearings in April we
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
we had um hours and hours and hours of
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
public hearings um and we incorporated
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
that you will see that the Draft rules
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
that were the initial proposal in
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
February is vastly different than the
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
proposal than the final version that you
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
have here and that's because we took
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
massive amounts of input so it simply
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
isn't true that input wasn't solicited
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
that input wasn't taken and the input
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't incorporated into it um
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
we made tons of changes based on the
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
input we received from the general
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
public from legislators and from
 
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.390 align:start position:0%
public from legislators and from
professional

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
Educators and that process is uh laid
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
out on a on the department of Ed website
 
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.349 align:start position:0%
out on a on the department of Ed website
as

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
well that's the
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
um my response I think Julie has some
 
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
response in some of the technical uh
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
allegations of not providing information
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
um Julie Shay Department of Education
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
um as far as the legislative oversight
 
00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee um we actually appeared twice
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
in front of them um the first time was
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
in June um the second time was later
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
and I have an email from August 19th
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
where representative cordelli asked me
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
for a copy of the final proposal which I
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
provided to him I was not asked to
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
provide any copy to the committee um
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
other than that and in the meeting I did
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
say that the copy they were looking at
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
was incorrect but I was not the one that
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
provided it and then I told them where
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
they could find that copy because I had
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
sent it I didn't realize that he hadn't
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
shared it with the rest of the committee
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
we weren't trying to give somebody an
 
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.430 align:start position:0%
we weren't trying to give somebody an
incorrect

00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.950 align:start position:0%
incorrect
copy

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
copy
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
um and that's what I have to say about
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
that and as far as the legislative
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
oversight committee um they are a
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee that makes recommendations and
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
they did make a recommendation to us we
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
were invited to speak several times um
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
at one point as um attorney Brown
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier she just had surgery
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
so she was unavailable to come to the
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
meeting the commissioner was also
 
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
unavailable and I as the administrative
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
rules coordinator manage the
 
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
administrative process of the rules and
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
it would not be um beneficial to anybody
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
if I showed up to that meeting alone to
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
answer policy questions because I am not
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
equipped to answer questions about
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
policy on rules I'm happy to answer
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions about the process and what we
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
did for that but I don't think it would
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
have been appropriate for me to answer
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
questions about academic standards or
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
through probably only a couple of minor
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
things to that I want to point out um
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
for the minimum standards because these
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
were important rules because this was a
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
long process we made a determination as
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
the department to create a separate web
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
page for the minimum standards um it has
 
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
been updated every single time there's
 
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
been an action so on that page you'll
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
find the initial proposal you'll find 's
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
comments to the front half and the back
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
half you'll find the final proposal
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
stage um there there it includes also um
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
all of the information regarding the
 
00:39:26.589 --> 00:39:26.599 align:start position:0%
educator cohorts the different meetings
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
that were had the listening sessions all
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the list of the the many listening
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
sessions this is the most transparent
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
process that I I have been involved in
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
in my two and a half years at the
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
department for rules we have done
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
everything we can do to make sure that
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
folks are on the right page and when I
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
say that I mean having the right copy um
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
having the most current version of the
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
rules that should be part of the
 
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
discussion um speaking toward um the
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislative over site committee I think
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
I two comments I did in fact from my um
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
bed listen to that meeting and and Julie
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
does properly summarize that the
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
questions that were being asked at that
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
meeting were very policy oriented they
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
were not procedure oriented they also um
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
are policy questions that are well
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
within the right of the legislature to
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
revise make changes to outside of the
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
scope of this gel car um we have Tak
 
00:40:31.309 --> 00:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
um we've had the first round of uh
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
comments that we received um from the os
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
office to the initial proposal had
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
substantial uh comments changes
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
recommended revisions those were taken
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
very seriously by the state board by the
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
department many hours were spent with
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
the people at this table reviewing the
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
comments that we received from Os Os is
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing those rules for the sole
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of advising this committee to
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we follow the process
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
that the rules are bound in statute and
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
we are not overstepping our legislative
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
Authority we worked very diligently we
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
are but this team worked very diligently
 
00:41:17.109 --> 00:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
together we also met multiple times with
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
OS that process resulted in what you'll
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
see as the very minimal comments that
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
you now see from OSS who are Adis ing
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
you with respect to whether we have
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
followed our rule process you will see
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
basically typographical changes is the
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
only thing that you'll see it indicates
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
that your staff believe that we have
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
followed the process at this point um
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
and that we have made the changes that
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
make this in compliance with the statute
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
and the process that we are required to
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
follow and that this committee is
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
required to follow and so I think most
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
importantly look to OS to just the types
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
of changes and the types of concerns
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
that they currently have with this draft
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
and they are minimal concerns which we
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
have addressed the um one so second I
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
want to speak to legislative oversight
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight voted in favor of
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
the rules on the condition that we make
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
a a change to the definition of educator
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
after reviewing that we did make that
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
change in the conditional approval it is
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
so noted that was submitted to OS that
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
is in the draft that OS reviewed prior
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the time we came here um with respect
 
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
to public comment the rule the law that
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
was in effect at the time that the
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
public comment was received and is still
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
in effect we were required to provide a
 
00:42:44.109 --> 00:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
report indicating how we had received
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
taken in and responded to the public
 
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
comment in the draft that you were
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
reviewing we complied with um with the
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
current law in so doing um I think this
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
process has been Thor
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
complete and I think that I would look
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
if I were on this committee to the
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
comments of OSS and use that as your
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
guide with respect to whether these
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
should be approved today um to the
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
extent that the legislative oversight
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
committee made re uh recommendations
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
that they believe were not followed that
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
they are a legislative body and we are
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
leading into a legislative session and
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
those changes could be
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
legislatively addressed but these rules
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
comply with current law and I think your
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
Council and your representatives from
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
OLS will advise you that that is in case
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have done everything
 
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
within the um the the role um
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
importantly I think
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
um the comment from uh regarding whether
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
or not um we have that that these are uh
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
contrary to um the public public
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
interest that's a very that's a term of
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
art when it comes to this committee and
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
that is really making sure that the
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
public has had an opportunity to be
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
heard and we this state board has given
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
the public multiple opportunities to be
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
heard three public hearings on these
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
rules and this committee has given the
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
public opportunities to be heard and
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
there changes have been made to the
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
rules based upon that comment so there's
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
no concern that this has not been a full
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
vetted process and the public comment
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
has not been considered and heard thank
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
you yes and there is in fact a report on
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
comments it's on page six of the F of
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
the meeting packet with the revised Rule
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
and it starts
 
00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
by um they had 223 public
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
comments during the initial period and
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
116 of them expressed General opposition
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
to wholesale changes but did not
 
00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:04.839 align:start position:0%
identify specific areas of concern and
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
then there are some comments that were
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
specific including one from Miss wilky
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
and to to make change to incorporate the
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
academic standards that have been
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
approved to attach those by
 
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.630 align:start position:0%
approved to attach those by
reference

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
deleted uh change the word curriculum to
 
00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:29.599 align:start position:0%
program and may may include was deleted
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
proposal and and as I said the class
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
size limitation was recopied from the
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
pre the currently approved rules so
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's I can't
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
say that
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
the board of education did not follow
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
the process and listen to the public
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
they may not have Incorporated all the
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
comments particularly those that are
 
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.470 align:start position:0%
comments particularly those that are
policy

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
issues and but they have in
 
00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:09.079 align:start position:0%
fact uh received the comments and acted
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
on many of them any any other comments
 
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
or questions representative Vera thank
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
you I do have um a
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
comment referring to House Bill 1622
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
starting date on December 9th it was
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
used in the previous rules as a reason
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
to step back
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how we would not apply
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
it to this rule as well even though it's
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
not in fact the intent is there number
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
two one of the things about public
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
hearings is that they are to be
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
transparent and when someone from the
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
chair has a meeting with and I'm not
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
looking at either one of you as that
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
when when the chair of a of a when the
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner of a department meets with
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
a PRI with a member of the commission or
 
00:46:57.309 --> 00:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
a committee and then report reports back
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee and is not there to
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
have a public discussion at a public
 
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
hearing that is an issue of
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
transparency number three House Bill
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
1671 and
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
1691 were attempts in the last term to
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
address some of the changes that are
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
made in these rules and those bills did
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
not pass they failed in the house
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
therefore that shows legislative intent
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the that the changes in these
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
documents are against legislative intent
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
which is another component of our
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
reasons to
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
object number three there was no
 
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
discussion um this year in in um the
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
last year of this of this uh term House
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 1107 passed the house and was
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor and it is meant
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
to update the Frameworks so why would we
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
use use Frameworks that are decades old
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
to when they are meant to be updated and
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
have been asked to be updated by the
 
00:48:05.839 --> 00:48:07.390 align:start position:0%
have been asked to be updated by the
legislature

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
another legislative intent
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
Point um would you please answer the
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
question about the Frameworks because
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
that seems worrisome well I would be
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
happy to do that uh we incorporated I I
 
00:48:22.589 --> 00:48:22.599 align:start position:0%
assume you're talking about the um State
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
academic standards right okay um
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
anybody here who's not familiar with the
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
process of updating the State academic
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
standards might not understand that it
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
takes uh years for each one when I first
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
got on the board we did some of those
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
and it's a approximately two-year
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
process to update academic standards I
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
have right here the academic standards
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
that have not been
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
updated this would take each one of
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
these would take years to do
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
um it is not realistic or advisable to
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
hold the update of the minimum standards
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
until we take probably 12 to 16 years to
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
update all these academic standards they
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
are Incorporated by
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
reference because these are the
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
standards we have most of these are
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
common core standards so I know we've
 
00:49:22.549 --> 00:49:22.559 align:start position:0%
had lots of arguments um about those
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
over the years um updates to those would
 
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
change change the common core
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
standards we are keeping them in place
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
when they come up for their proper
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
renewal the intent is to take them up
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
and renew them but it takes a lot of
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
work um we're a small board and we take
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
these uh standards updates very
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
seriously and we want to give them our
 
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
complete attention it's simply not
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
realistic or practical to hold up the
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
306s until every academic standard can
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
be updated
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes and I would mention that the 306
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
rules could be very quickly amended if
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
you needed to update the version of the
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
academic standards and that and that
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that M Madam chairman is why we
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
incorporated it by rule right so the 306
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
is previously would have to be amended
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
themselves if they had these written
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
into them because we incorporated them
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
by rule we can update these academic
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
standards without going back and
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
reopening the 306 is much more efficient
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
and um May I assume that the board of
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
education is planning to actually update
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
those on a plan schedule and what which
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
academic standard are you currently in
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
the middle of uh we are not in the well
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
we we had social studies um before covid
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
we were working on that and we made a
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
lot of progress and it got disrupted by
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
the covid process that would be the one
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we would probably take up first um
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of them that that uh
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
really do require attention and revision
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we intend to get to those do you
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
have a a schedule or a plan I hope I I
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
have a spreadsheet of all of the
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
standards when they are adopted when
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
they're due to be reviewed and we're
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
starting to work on what that will look
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
like um I did I do also want to point
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
out in the front half we did adopt a new
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
rule that shows um a process by which
 
00:51:22.829 --> 00:51:22.839 align:start position:0%
the state board will um not only take up
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
academic standards but review them on a
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
10-year period prior to that and the
 
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:30.440 align:start position:0%
legislative update there was no timeline
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
for updating academic standards like
 
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
there is for rules and so now that we've
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
set that in place we now have a
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism where we will have a schedule
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
to update these standards and make sure
 
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.160 align:start position:0%
that they're reviewed and again as as
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
chairman Klein stated um it it doesn't
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
make sense to um not update the rules
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
with these standards because they
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
haven't been updated the process now
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
that they're in rule is to now look at
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
them and update them and use the um
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
expedited process to change the
 
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
Incorporated references as necessary
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
once we update them and that will be a
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
much quicker and administratively
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
efficient process thank you represent
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
and that role is Ed
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
30626 it is on page 33 of the amended
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request thank you
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
and and just to the point we also
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
received a lot of public input regarding
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
the academic standards and the fact that
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
there was no review cycle which is one
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the reasons
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
why I took the lead in drafting this
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
Rule and and it be so we would have a a
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
process established in our rules because
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
it wasn't established by Statute and it
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't previously established by rule so
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
yes it's the last page that you should
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
look at page 33 um represent do you have
 
00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
a quick
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
question I do Madam
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm sorry that you have so much
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
paper work but I can assure you we do
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
too and um that's part of the work part
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
of the job and the reason why we're
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
here and um my comment is why would we
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
adopt rules that are as old as 2001 and
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
in the case of social studies 2005 and
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
why did you not update these Frameworks
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
if they were so meaningful to the
 
00:53:21.069 --> 00:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
department and or to the school
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
districts no speeches please they have
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
already stated they are develop they are
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
instituting a planned R update of all of
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
their standards and I believe social
 
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
one representative Leon um thank you
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair I had actually been somewhat
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
troubled by The Common Core inclusion
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
but as I looked at it I appreciate the
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
process that you have for updating the
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
academic standards um I wanted to speak
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
to representative gr's um comment about
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
the previous rule referencing House Bill
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
1622 it did not um there are the
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
existing um standards for considering
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
public comment pursuant to RSA 44
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
54111 there are already standards there
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
and I was referencing those and not
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
specifically House Bill 1622 quite
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
frankly it would have been very
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
convenient to speak to the fact that
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
there's been so much public comment and
 
00:54:17.109 --> 00:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
we want to understand how it's been
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
included but when you look at it and you
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
look at the volume of work both in this
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
and in the landfill one if we were to do
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
that and have them go back go back
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
through their work go and dissect what
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
they did what they included when and
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
where that process would probably add a
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
year to both of the rules and I know
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
that people who don't like the rules
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
would be happy about that but it also
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
would just grind things to a halt we
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
already dealt with that with covid with
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
everything else that came up and took
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
people's Focus off of the normal process
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
of government and dealt with the new
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
crises that we had trying to take a law
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
that we have and then go retrospectively
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
to apply it to our process wouldn't be
 
00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:56.950 align:start position:0%
to apply it to our process wouldn't be
appropriate

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
as convenient as peronet might find it
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly it would have been
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
nice to have that on the landfill but we
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
can't do that we can't change the
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
conditions prior to the effective date
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
of a law and so we move forward and
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be great to have this transparency
 
00:55:13.789 --> 00:55:13.799 align:start position:0%
but we can't go back and change the past
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
on this so we move forward and I I
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
believe that the process um has been
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive I've worked with I've
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
worked with the education and I've
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
worked with the people in that committee
 
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.000 align:start position:0%
and I know there's always Viewpoint
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
differences but I I I believe that I
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
believe in the process actually the
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
landfill rules do have a fairly
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
extensive report on how they address
 
00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:35.029 align:start position:0%
extensive report on how they address
public

00:55:35.029 --> 00:55:35.039 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
comments and it is full of technical
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
details that I can't evaluate if it
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
shows they Incorporated them or not but
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
they're there representative fellows you
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
had a question um yes within RSA n21
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
there's a description of the Department
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
of Education in the bureaus the the
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
divisions and the bureaus and one of
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
those bureaus has a responsibility to
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
maintain and update the um standards the
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
minimum standards so I really don't
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
understand why since there's staff
 
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
available that there has no no rule has
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
been no work has been done on updating
 
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
these Frameworks Senator Whitley's right
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
here can you explain that Whitley's
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
right here Le not sitting in for anybody
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
I I I without speaking directly to that
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
state law um the Board of Education that
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
takes up the uh state standards and
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
we're charged with um reviewing them
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
adopting them and um again there there's
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
a process to do this but um and and just
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
to representative gr's point I'm not
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
complaining about the paperwork of the
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
work burden I love this work so you
 
00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
won't hear I'm not that's not a
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
complaint to point out that this is a
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
lot of work um we are obligated to
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
update the rules every 10 years we are
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's a conveyor belt right so every
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
state board meeting we have new rules
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
that have expired or going to expire
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
that we have to update and that's a
 
00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of work and the 306s were a
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
lot of work um the minimum standards or
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
the um academic standards aren't on that
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
same conveyor belt
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
so our workload is such that um we do
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
look for opportunities to take up
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
they our our focus is on doing Our
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
obligation to update the rules so I mean
 
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:37.960 align:start position:0%
that is kind of how it works on the
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
state board with a seven member board
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
with no staff and just to point out I me
 
00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:44.039 align:start position:0%
the department has been amazing but the
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
Board of Education itself has no
 
00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:49.960 align:start position:0%
staff um and we're part-time volunteers
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
so these things get taken up
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
um we think an appropriate rate but I do
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
I I just want to maybe point out that I
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
think I failed to understand the
 
00:58:01.079 --> 00:58:02.470 align:start position:0%
think I failed to understand the
argument

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
argument
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we can't change the 306s and we
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
should keep the 306s the way they are in
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
current form
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
because the 306s are responsible for our
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
high academic achievement in New
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
standards have to be changed and it's
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
unacceptable that we don't change those
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
compatible thank you and I would
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh like to mention your staff has
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
apparently decided that you will be
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing the uh academic standards on a
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
schedule which which is good and I
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
support that I was glad to see that in
 
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
the rule because that you know I I think
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's necessary that's
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
probably to a large degree more
 
00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:54.039 align:start position:0%
important than your rules yes and in
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
many cases that's more important okay
 
00:58:58.029 --> 00:58:58.039 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a follow-up question
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
please um brief one please yes it is
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
indeed brief so um it is my
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
understanding and that the the board the
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education by
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
Statute is supposed to be compos is
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
composed of people who do not have
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
professional education
 
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:25.160 align:start position:0%
experience and that the department of
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
educa that is why one reason that the
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and the staff
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
that it employs who is charged with
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
maintaining and and revising rules are
 
00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.510 align:start position:0%
maintaining and and revising rules are
professional

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
Educators would you like to respond to
 
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:45.559 align:start position:0%
that any change to that is obviously a
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
matter of policy and not of the rule I'm
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
referring to statute those are statutory
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
requirements that the board cannot be
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
professional Educators but the
 
00:59:59.710 --> 00:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has staff who
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
are and can develop rules thank you
 
01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799 align:start position:0%
develop Frameworks I'm talking about
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
sorry Senator Whitley you had a question
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
I just didn't know if they wanted to
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
respond it's
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay no Madam chair thank you I you know
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address an issue and
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
ask a further question there was a
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
representation made by the chair about
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
that there was quote disinformation
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
about class size ratio and I think
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's a very unfair characterization no
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
it's you have many qualified Educators
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
who have provided hours and hours folks
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
that are in the field administrators
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
that are in the field sharing
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
information about how there is clear
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
confusion in the language here over how
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
many certified teachers must be in a
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
class with students um and so you know I
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
want to uh ask you to respond to that
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
why it's disinformation when there's
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
clear confusion excuse me senator
 
01:00:56.799 --> 01:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
clear confusion excuse me senator
the

01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
disinformation is that people were
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
responding to the
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
preliminary rule after it had been
 
01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:09.039 align:start position:0%
changed by the Board of Education to be
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as the current rule
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
which does have specific educ specific
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
limits well we'll let him respond
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
because my understanding was the
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
disinformation was over the class ratio
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
and my second point to that if you can
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
respond to is sort of this is a very
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
substantive BAS Bas on what the
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
qualified Educators administrators are
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
saying about this confusion about how it
 
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
is making a substantive change about you
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
know that's really not directed by the
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
legislature sort of what is the
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
authority to to go beyond that
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
Authority we have not gone beyond any
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
Authority that's incorrect um we the
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
disinformation is as chairman Maguire
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
said uh we months ago and I don't
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
remember the exact timeline here
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
somebody could look it up if they wanted
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
to uh Incorporated
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
the um current class size ratios into
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
the new rules we made a point of stating
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
that fact at board meeting we put the
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
rules out there and after that fact
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
people continue to falsely claim that
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
there's no class size ratio in there
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
disinformation yes I got an email just
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday that said that we need to have
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
class siiz ratios in these room rules
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes right but the
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
information that is being provided is
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
not disinformation because you're
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
looking at the to what people are doing
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
is looking at the totality of the rules
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
in addition to the definition of an
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
educator I'm sorry the senator in 306 14
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
the class size ratios are are in the
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
rule so it's disinformation to say that
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're not there so in the initial
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
proposal the class sizes were removed
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
there were extensive comments on that in
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the next proposed draft the class
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
siiz section was was added back into the
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules specifically based on that comment
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's why it removed my comment on the
 
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
state educator ratios because they put
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
it back in it is in
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
30614 and it says clearly the school
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
board shall establish student student
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
educator ratios an educator has been
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
changed to the definition in 21 in 8D
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
which says teacher and certified par
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
professional um the ratios that promote
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
student learning for each learning
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity and learning level based
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
upon school safety policies content
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
instructional method the characteristics
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
of Learners and the following
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten grade through two 25
 
01:03:47.309 --> 01:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
students or fewer per educator grades 3
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
through 5 30 students fewer per educator
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
and middle school and high school 30
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
students or feral per educator it also
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
has um
 
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
aspirations that they try to have lower
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
ratios but they have set a
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
up so what I think the the confusion is
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh you have to read these rules together
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
and so the concern is the definition of
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
educator just as you're describing so
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
the concern is there is little
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
clarification about how many certified
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
teachers are in in the classroom and
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is the concern when you're reading
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
the ratio with the definition of
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
educator there is confusion about how
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
many certified teachers are required the
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
term educator is including certified par
 
01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:44.039 align:start position:0%
PA of professional it is not you you do
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
have to read the rules as a whole and I
 
01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
would like to point out
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
30612 says You must have an educator
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
with their content area leading a class
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
a certified paraprofessional cannot
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
teach a class they have to be certified
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
in their
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
area so that is when you read those
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
together each classroom for each
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity so again each
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
learning opportunity has to have these
 
01:05:17.269 --> 01:05:17.279 align:start position:0%
ratios a teacher who is credentialed in
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
their content area so in a social
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
studies class A teacher who is certified
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
in social studies must be teaching that
 
01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.710 align:start position:0%
in social studies must be teaching that
class

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Chandler thank you I
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
have just a very quick question that
 
01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:39.799 align:start position:0%
might perhaps explain maybe not um the
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
some of the confusion and um I'm just
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if the conditional approval
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
request for the 306 is is currently on
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
the department of education's website
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
yes it is thank you yes but I will I
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
will say that from the the comments from
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
the public many people have not fully
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
analyzed the latest version and that is
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
something that is very common in the in
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the legislative process as well as
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
process representative uh fellows thank
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so you just made the
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
remark that this the ratio is based on
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
teachers who are credential in the
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
particular class area but this rule does
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
not say teacher it says educator and you
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
have also just told us recently that
 
01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.430 align:start position:0%
have also just told us recently that
educator

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
educator
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
means um what certified teacher or
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
teacher or certified par educ teacher or
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
certified par
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
professional that particular um RSA that
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
you're referencing was was written only
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
a year ago and adopted a year ago and
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that particular RSA is to
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
describe a grant program to encourage
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
teachers and paraprofessionals to be um
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
part uh to be recruited and
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
educated so that they can increase the
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
number of uh teachers and Prof par
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
professionals available to our schools
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
because we know there are are short ages
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
of that how that that definition in that
 
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
statute applies only to that statute and
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
there is nothing else in all the rest of
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
the statutes that can support your um
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
definition that in a classroom you
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
should be using teachers and
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
paraprofessionals as if they are
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
Educators so the statute the statute in
 
01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.269 align:start position:0%
Educators so the statute the statute in
219

01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
219
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
8D is used by the department because
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
they are bound by 541a to use the
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
statutary definition of educator and it
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
is the only definition of educator in
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
the entire statute set so they use the
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
definition that they could use and like
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
like uh Julie Shay said if you read the
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
rules together it does not mean that a a
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
certified par professional would be
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
considered in the educator
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
um student ratio you have to read the
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
the the rules together you can't pull
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
out this one rule and say the definition
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
is not correct the definition is teacher
 
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
or par professional when you're using
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
the word educator in the ratios it means
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
teacher if they mean ex representative
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
fellows you've made your point please
 
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
fellows you've made your point please
don't

01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
argue representative hacken Phillips
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I I am
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
concerned with this definitional change
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
change and um I believe um there are
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
the calculations for per pupil costs
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
this calculation was not developed based
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
on class size ratios and so I think it
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
is unknown what type of fiscal impact
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
the shift to class siiz ratios may have
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
on our funding obligations
 
01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:46.309 align:start position:0%
on our funding obligations
specifically

01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
um when you shift uh it creates an
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity specifically for
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
downshifting of State funding
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
obligations to localities if local
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
districts are determining to offer more
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
than the minimum framework requirements
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
in a way that was not previously
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
happening so uh in addition when you
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
look at that committee's final report
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
State funding obligations are determined
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
by student teacher class maximums in
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
accordance with Essa standards and when
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
you switch from the class siiz maximum
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
to class siiz ratios um and when that
 
01:10:20.910 --> 01:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
isn't enacted it will disrupt current
 
01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
funding obligations because of the way
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
that that is calculated and I believe
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education will
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
need to evaluate which districts are out
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
of compliance and to calculate the
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
different funding obligations when these
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
rules are put into effect I think both
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
will create additional administrative
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
costs on a local level and a Statewide
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
level and possibly change our funding
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
obligations but I'll note that there
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
have been there have been no fiscal
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
notes for either these local or
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide Department costs included in
 
01:10:53.470 --> 01:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
the proposal for these rules I think um
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the state is to Supply
 
01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
and adequate
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
education and you know this will have a
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
significant impact economic impact
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
locally and Statewide and the public has
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
a right to know whether it's a positive
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
or A negative local or Statewide impact
 
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
and none of this has been fully vetted
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
and I think this is another basis for an
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
objection to these rules um there is the
 
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
possibility and opportunity for an
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
economic impact here that has not been
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
fully Ved and I do believe that we need
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
to take more time to look into that um
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
the for this proposal Mr K you were you
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
were going to respond to that yeah um
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
again as was just stated for um quite a
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
while now the class size ratios are in
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
these rules they were not removed there
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
is no change to the class siiz ratios
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
one of the responses we got when we
 
01:11:50.669 --> 01:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
floated the idea of going to ratios
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
instead of hard caps was exactly that
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
point you had made about calcul ating um
 
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
funding so in response to the feedback
 
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
again we incorporated the class- siiz
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
Caps into these proposed rules they're
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
in there in
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
30614 in
 
01:12:11.629 --> 01:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
30612 it makes clear that you cannot
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
lead a class unless you're certified in
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
that subject matter so par professionals
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
under these rules may not lead teach
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
classes so those are myths those are uh
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings they're not true class
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
siiz caps are in and only certified
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
licensed teachers can lead teach
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
classes thank you also the fiscal impact
 
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
statements were done by the Legislative
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
budget assistant and they both proposals
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
have fiscal impact statements I do not
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
know the scope of how far they go
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
through what the they're they're doing a
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement on the the rule
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
text they don't go further than that
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
they have never been included in any of
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
our packets so this is new information
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
to the legislature the fiscal impact
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
statements are in all of the
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
packets representative Leon um thank you
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair the current rules state
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
kindergarten grade 2 25 students or
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
fewer per
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
educator it wasn't previously defined
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
ased I don't know if it was defined as
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
educator this is not a change in
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
language at all objecting to language
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is currently in statutes I don't
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
think makes
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
sense and that is no change from the
 
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.470 align:start position:0%
sense and that is no change from the
previous

01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
rule okay anyone
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.270 align:start position:0%
 
move

01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay Senator ward has moved to approve
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
second by representative
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
Leon any further comments questions
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes um I I think we need to take some
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
time to lay out why um you know I will
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
not be voting for the approval I think
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's multiple multiple basis uh for
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
objections and I will defer to some
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.189 --> 01:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
objections I think we've heard them
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips thank you
 
01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.229 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips thank you
madam

01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
madam
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
chair so um I'd like to take a moment to
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
focus on the first half of the rules and
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
the public comment according to OS and
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
our leg ative admin administrative rules
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
office it's unusual for any rule to
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
change um and attract public comment
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
submissions toing more than a dozen
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
responses it's highly unusual for a rule
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
change to attract more than 200
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
responses and in this case more than
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
half of the 223 public comment
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
submissions were characterized to be in
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
general opposition to the changes that
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education initially
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
proposed so rather than reflecting upon
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
more than 50% return in the these
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
negative responses to the proposed
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
changes and determining the merits of
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
those highly unusual submission rates
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
for public
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
comment the state board and the
 
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education effectively
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
overruled the 50% of the public comment
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
submissions without providing any
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
evidence on the merits as to why it
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
should dismiss the generalized
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
opposition and why it concluded the
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
proposal should continue so for instance
 
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion about why the
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
existing rules for our Public Schools um
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
our need of substantial change although
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
there was no legislative directive to do
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
so and such changes were contrary to the
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
unusually high rate of public opposition
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
the Deport the Department of Education
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
and the State Board did not provide full
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of the remaining 107 public
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
comment submissions to substantiate the
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
merits of moving forward with the
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
proposal and it is worth noting that jel
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
car has not been informed whether any of
 
01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
the 107 remaining public comments were
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
generally positive in support of the
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
proposed changes and whether the
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education investigated or
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
evaluated the merits of those claims
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
instead the final proposal responded to
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
nine issue areas of the education 306
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
rules that were publicly commented upon
 
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
citing approximately 25 parties
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
submissions but the final Pro proposal
 
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
does not address the any responses to
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the approximately 82 remaining party
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
submissions and whether those comments
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
were evaluated or Incorporated based on
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
the merits so this summer uh when the
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
department Department commissioner
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
testified before the legislature that
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
some of the department conflict um
 
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
public comments had conflicted with
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
other public comments submissions but
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
the department never provided any detail
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
about those conflicting comments more
 
01:16:40.669 --> 01:16:40.679 align:start position:0%
concerning however the Department's
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
failure to provide evidence for
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
evaluating the merits of those comments
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
or determining which side of the
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
conflicting comments were deemed correct
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
or valuable and whether those comments
 
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
or any proportion thereof were
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
Incorporated so instead the Department's
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
final propos proposal provided a link to
 
01:16:58.830 --> 01:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
its website with all the public
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
testimony so that Jael car and thereby
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
the public could independently perform
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
the administrative work of evaluating
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
the remaining 82 comments and what is
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
most concerning is that gel car and the
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
public are left wondering how the
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
department determined the merits for
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
each and why it decided not to respond
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I read through the 593 pages of the
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
initial public comment period for the
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
front half of the rules and I found one
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
positive comment for the proposed
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
which can generally be um located on
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
page 329 so that's correct one of the
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
223 public comments can be generally
 
01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
characterized in support of the changes
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
for the education 306 rules and
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
interestingly the single comments
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
General praise was centered around the
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
particular individual advancing compet
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
Competency Based learning in New
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that point was Competency
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
Based learning and which type should be
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
Advanced um was later are than
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
contradicted by numerous other
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
submissions so again the department has
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
provided no explanation for how it
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
interpreted the particular conflict of
 
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
opinion and which side of the discussion
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
if at all has been Incorporated so the
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
pervasive theme Here is that dozens of
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
public comment
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
submissions in that final proposal is
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
watering down the existing minimum
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
standards for students including the
 
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
removal of class siiz maximum caps for
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
class ratios that does not include the
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
method for calculating those ratios or
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
the reference Chang from courses to
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities which has been
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
alleged to further exacerbate the
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
inequalities and inequities across the
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
state's Public Schools the department
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
does not address this concern or present
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
evidence that the changes would actually
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
strengthen our standards thus
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
overwriting the vast majority of these
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
public comments so you know you can look
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
to page 47 the demarks from Meredith
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
noted that there's been no research
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
based evidence shared by the department
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
to justify its proposed changes to these
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
existing rules which they believe is a
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
disregard for the Democratic process
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
there are additional multiple multiple
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities and um public comments
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
that were never responded to so the
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
members of Jael car have noticed the
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
dozens of emails addressed to us that
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
have come into our inbox this season
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
urging us to vote no on the final
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
proposed Ed 306 rules I've skinned my
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislative email inbox and I cannot
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
find a single email urging support for
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
this what is of greatest concern to jel
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
car is that in the absence of the
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
legislative directive to significantly
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
change the 306 rules the department
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be overriding the overwhelming
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
public disapproval of this proposal
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
without providing evid evidentiary
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
support for doing so and specifically
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
today I'm seeing that there are volumes
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
of stakeholder input um compiled by
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
Christine Downey and Educators across
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
the state um who are very concerned
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
about the legislative attent and the
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
authority of the agency to advance these
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
rules without incorporating in a
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
meaningful way their public input in
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
fact um I don't believe that they are
 
01:20:02.189 --> 01:20:02.199 align:start position:0%
permitted to speak today in today's
 
01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
testimony even though they're here
 
01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
prepared to give testimony in the room
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
which I find is another piece of
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
evidence where the public comment is not
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
being fully meaningfully heard and taken
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
into account by our state I do believe
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
we can do better I do believe it's
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
against the public interest to move
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
forward uh without really having the
 
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
department substantiate its position in
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
a transparent way so there is evidence
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
to believe that you know despite the
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
reassurances we have heard over and over
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
again that the department has a greater
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to fully provide the evidence
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
and its evaluation of this public
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
comment period um I think we can do
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
better and I believe that the public
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.239 --> 01:20:50.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh um just to be clear I did receive
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
public testimony for the this Jael car
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
meeting on these rules I evaluated that
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
the public testimony that I received and
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
all of them were referring to the
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
original draft of the rules they are not
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
relevant here which is why I did not
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
write write a summary of them the the
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
rules that the testimony that I have on
 
01:21:15.629 --> 01:21:15.639 align:start position:0%
my desk now was given to me this morning
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
before the meeting it has not been
 
01:21:19.950 --> 01:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
evaluated yet Madam chair can I just
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
respond to that wait just to be clear
 
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
too the your fiscal impact statement is
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
on page s
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
of the 202 2441 FP meeting packet and
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
the 202442 meeting packet on page four
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
there are two fiscal impacts for these
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
rules thank you may I just briefly
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
respond I do think that this is a due
 
01:21:40.149 --> 01:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
notice argument we we are concerned that
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
members of the general public today do
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
not understand which form of the rules
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
we are moving to approve I think there
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
is a concern about what notice has been
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
given and what the actual public
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
believes we are doing today my concern
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
is that the first public
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
hearings that were held as we've heard
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
quite a long time ago more than a year
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
in some cases there has not been a
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful opportunity for additional
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
public input with a public hearing after
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
these rules have been changed so we have
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
multiple iterations of a new form of
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
this set of 306 rules without a single
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
moment in time where the public has been
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
able to weigh in with real-time feedback
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
to those changes to have that realtime
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
feedback incorporated into the new set
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
of rules so I am I am pumping the brakes
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
here I do believe there is a public
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
interest concern worth evaluating if I
 
01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
may respond to that um first of all I do
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
want to point out that these rules were
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
set to expire in March of 2024 so if we
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
did not move forward with changes we
 
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
would have no rules and so that is why
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward um additionally we
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
are not required by 541a to offer any
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
additional public hearings beyond the
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
ones we offered not to say that we
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't however
 
01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
the monthly state board meetings offer
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
public comment at the beginning of every
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
single meeting now if it's not you know
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
earmarked as minimum standards public
 
01:23:05.669 --> 01:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
comment people can still come and speak
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
and they have um and people have had
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
ample opportunity um to make their
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
feelings known on the proposal
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
additionally we did release and post on
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
our website which was not required of us
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
all of the public comment so that
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
everybody could see it um a lot of the
 
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
public comment was General
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
opposition which is which you can
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
understand but there's not anything that
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
we can do to make changes based on that
 
01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
we have to move the rules
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
forward the rules are set we set to
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
expire they are under an extension from
 
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.070 align:start position:0%
expire they are under an extension from
541

01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
541
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
a14a meaning after Jael car final action
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
they will be valid for 30 days if the
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
department does not adopt um so several
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
of these rule sections are set to expire
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
when this process is over thank you
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley thank you madam chair I
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear about um the basis
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
for an objection which is why I you
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
believe strongly that we should all vote
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
against the motion the motion to approve
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh one that these rules are contrary to
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislative intent two these rules are
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
contrary to the public interest and
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
three based on the impact the economic
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
impact of these rules these are three
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
basis for for objection I've been on ja
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
car now four years I've never seen a
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
stronger case for an objection I've
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
never seen a stronger public outcry
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
asking us to object and so I just wanted
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that was clearly on the
 
01:24:37.629 --> 01:24:37.639 align:start position:0%
record thank
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
you anyone director moral um with your
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
permission I'd like to briefly Explain
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
how and why we have different versions
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
benefit okay
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
please um in February the department um
 
01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
the board excuse me the board approved
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
its initial
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
proposal um I think that may have been
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat hurried that's my own opinion
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
because they were heading towards a uh
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
expiration date of the current rules um
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
there were significant changes in it for
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
example the educator p ratio was going
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
to be left up to the individual
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
districts um after the initial proposal
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
public comment was received Department
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
drafted its final proposal was based on
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
public comments their own concerns and
 
01:25:39.550 --> 01:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
OSS comments um the final proposal was
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
approved by the board in August August
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
14th of this year they filed that final
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
Proposal with us
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it was before the
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
conditional approval but on
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
819 yeah uh September 12th conditional
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
approval was approved by the board that
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
amended when the final proposal was sent
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
to us OLS the committee's attorneys
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
review that and make comments on that
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
the board then reviewed those and said
 
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
yes we can make some further changes
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
thus the conditional
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
approval last month the committee heard
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
testimony on this proposal and
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that the depart the board
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
also did an amended conditional approval
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
to make further changes and that's what
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
the committee is considering today the
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval so it is
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
essentially the fourth draft of the
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
rules and all of these drafts have been
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
posted on the education website I have
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
followed them on the website our process
 
01:26:48.750 --> 01:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
is not um we don't post every proposal
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
that is filed but we have have all of
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
our files are open record for anyone if
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
they ask me for any proposal or any
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
Proposal with my comments on it they
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
will get
 
01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:00.709 align:start position:0%
will get
it

01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay Senator gr uh point of order um I'm
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not we have a
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
motion in front of us but I'm wondering
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
whether a an objection would be a higher
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
priority uh that I've heard two one
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
Senator and one representative say that
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know they believe that they have
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
grounds for an objection if we can deal
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
with that then we can get on with the
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
rest of it um if that uh motion
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
fails uh does anyone in the staff know
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
what the priority of motions
 
01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
is the first motion have has to be
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
removed okay it has to be removed the
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
easiest way to remove it is to vote on
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
it is that if that is
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
agreeable Senator Chanley I believe you
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
had a comment
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes and and and I acknowledge uh uh
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's point that we are we are
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
discussing we are in the middle we have
 
01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
a motion on the floor but just I I was
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
curious you know we've talked about this
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
version that version I asked you know is
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
the most is the
 
01:28:18.189 --> 01:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
um the uh conditional
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
approval version on the department of
 
01:28:24.669 --> 01:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
education's website the answer is yes I
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
was trying to part of the pro reason I
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
when you click on it it says page not
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
found now I may be doing something wrong
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
but that is what I am getting so I don't
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
know so my concern is you know at least
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
I just raised the issue that there you
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
know it isn't for necessarily for lack
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
of trying that people are not working
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
from the correct version I just want
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank for that
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I I want to
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that uh a tremendous amount
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
of effort has gone into this on the part
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
of all the parties who are involved
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
closely it's not for lack of effort uh
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
but there this is very complex in term
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
procedurally and structurally and so
 
01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
forth and so the fact that the public is
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
not completely on board or completely
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
informed is a simple fact they're not uh
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
that that's not for a lack of
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
trying I I think we've come a long way I
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
don't think we're there yet I don't
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
think these rules should be opposed
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
approved at this time and so I'm going
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be voting to object if we ever get
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
there and I'm going to be voting no on
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
the approval motion if we have to come
 
01:29:51.109 --> 01:29:51.119 align:start position:0%
to that Mo vote first thank you thank
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%

01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%

the previous set of rules we had public
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
comment last month and that's why I was
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
only going to have a procedural comment
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%

will specifically ask that you not
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
duplicate previous
 
01:49:43.719 --> 01:49:45.669 align:start position:0%
duplicate previous
speakers

01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
um Mrs
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
roers oh she stepped out
 
01:49:54.189 --> 01:49:54.199 align:start position:0%
okay and I am not intending to give
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
everybody 15 minutes because that will
 
01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:58.430 align:start position:0%
everybody 15 minutes because that will
be

01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
duplicative what did you say yes she is
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
here she is here oh thank you I you I
 
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
speak hello my name is Ashley de R roer
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Rochester New
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a mother and my child goes
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
to schools I'm here today specifically
 
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
to speak one as a parent as a taxpayer
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
and as a concerned citizen I want to
 
01:50:37.709 --> 01:50:37.719 align:start position:0%
emphasize first that the fact that I
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to speak for the first part
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
rules speaks to a larger issue here that
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
public interest is not being
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
considered which is a factor in
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
objecting to these first first part of
 
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
these rules that went through there is
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
clear confusion and concern from
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
citizens and people in this state
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the changes of the 306 rules
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
however it moves forward
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
regardless as it relates to minimum
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
standards the legislative oversight
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
committee has not reviewed such
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
Frameworks that are being described as
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
being changed why is that where is the
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
public interest in this in this matter
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
are we informed about such Frameworks
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
what are
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
they they're not clear to us as a parent
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not being informed about such
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
Frameworks there's also the word program
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
what does that mean they talked earlier
 
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
about how the minimum standards there's
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
no schedule they don't even know what
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
they are there's a lot of words salad
 
01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:46.790 align:start position:0%
they are there's a lot of words salad
around

01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
that so I want to understand that and
 
01:51:51.870 --> 01:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's not clear so there's now to be a
 
01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:53.669 align:start position:0%
it's not clear so there's now to be a
vote

01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
on these minimum standards that we are
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
hearing there's no schedule to even to
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
even change them oh we haven't had the
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
time there's no
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
staff such excuses there's no there's
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely no excuse for that this is
 
01:52:11.119 --> 01:52:12.149 align:start position:0%
absolutely no excuse for that this is
their

01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
job but yet all this time has been taken
 
01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
to change these 306 rules this doesn't
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
make sense and I explained this to Madam
 
01:52:21.679 --> 01:52:23.229 align:start position:0%
make sense and I explained this to Madam
chair

01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
in the fact that the fact that the
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's all this public outcry saying
 
01:52:30.069 --> 01:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
that hey we don't like this and there's
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
not a lot of specifics around why we
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't like it well maybe because there
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
is inconsistencies and it's confusing
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
which again gives more reason to
 
01:52:44.189 --> 01:52:44.199 align:start position:0%
object and if the legislative oversight
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee did not have the ability to
 
01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
review minimum standards is it because
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
there aren't any minimum standards what
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
are the standards what are the
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are there any how could there
 
01:52:58.589 --> 01:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
be any Frameworks or standards if
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're not present it's contradicting
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
and it's contradictory and it's
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
concerning how could we fund something
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
how could we pay for something how could
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
we send our children to schools for
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
something if we don't know what we're
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
to I'll pause for a second because I
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
want to read something that's very
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
I also want to emphasize and I said this
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
to a couple members in the
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
chairwoman I understand that the general
 
01:53:46.109 --> 01:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
court website does have the updated
 
01:53:48.270 --> 01:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
versions and the unconditional approval
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
as such but um as it was stated by I I
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
can't remember her name Julie who is up
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
here for um the commissioner of
 
01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
Education Department of Education that
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
the their website had the updated rules
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
the page was not found when clicked on
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
that link and it was 5 days of that and
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
I had been looking at that so for any
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
parent any person in the public anyone
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
trying to see that and was being told or
 
01:54:19.229 --> 01:54:19.239 align:start position:0%
maybe thought that it was there it says
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
the page isn't found which one could
 
01:54:23.550 --> 01:54:23.560 align:start position:0%
lead somebody to
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
well this service this part of the
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
government is not functioning for me or
 
01:54:30.830 --> 01:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
maybe it's in the process of being
 
01:54:32.910 --> 01:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
updated again maybe it's under
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
construction maybe nothing's happening
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
with this where would that lead us
 
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's not one it's not transparent it
 
01:54:41.589 --> 01:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
leads us to wonder what's going on in
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
the first place maybe it could have said
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
hey the page is not found please refer
 
01:54:50.109 --> 01:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
website that didn't happen
 
01:55:06.189 --> 01:55:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
transparent I'm looking for a quote
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
important it's by Thomas
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
so Thomas Jefferson recognized that
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
democracy only educated people can
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
accurately evaluate the governmental
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
them is the committee this Jael car
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
committee even
 
01:56:00.189 --> 01:56:00.199 align:start position:0%
educated on what we are voting on
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
today I'm not even educated on it I
 
01:56:07.069 --> 01:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:09.639 align:start position:0%
standards this is not in the interest of
 
01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
know Jefferson wrote to a colleague
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
about public education in
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
1786 no other sure Foundation can be
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%

establish and improve the law for
 
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
educating the common people let our
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
countrymen know that the people alone
 
01:56:42.030 --> 01:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
can protect against the evils of Kings
 
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
Nobles and Priests and that the tax
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
which will be paid for this purpose is
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
not more than the thousandth part of
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
what will be paid to the Kings and
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
Priests and no who rise up among us if
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
ignorance please object to this part of
 
01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.750 align:start position:0%
ignorance please object to this part of
the

01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
rules thank
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Marsha mcaffrey
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
I reside in the village of kukuk I
 
01:57:53.270 --> 01:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
retired from State service to years ago
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
but for 23 years from 1999 until
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
2022 I was the state Arts consultant at
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
Education I'm here to speak on behalf of
 
01:58:06.350 --> 01:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
all the people from around the state Who
 
01:58:08.149 --> 01:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
provided feedback and testimony
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
regarding the revision of 8306 standards
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
during public hearings particularly
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
those in support of systematic and
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
sequential art music and physical
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
education programs in our schools I'd
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
like to add that I had put in a request
 
01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
to provide this testimony in the first
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
for the first packet uh so I am being
 
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
called now while this is part of the
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
second packet so I will uh modify my
 
01:58:38.189 --> 01:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
statements many of my concerns were
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
addressed uh testimony from
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative M uh Miler particularly
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
around House Bill
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
1622 uh the timeline for that uh is to
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
go into a effect is December 9th that is
 
01:58:58.350 --> 01:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
a mere 10 business days from today and
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
the first half uh which has already been
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
voted on my recommendation was to have
 
01:59:10.069 --> 01:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh this deliberative body uh request
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
public uh a a public comment report um
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
on that half I do believe there is still
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
time because the second half is uh for
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
gel car is December 30th so I believe
 
01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:26.079 align:start position:0%
that would fall into the timeline for
 
01:59:29.229 --> 01:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
requesting a report of public comment I
 
01:59:31.629 --> 01:59:31.639 align:start position:0%
think that uh what became very clear to
 
01:59:34.830 --> 01:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
me in the first half for the packet of
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
the the first half of these standards is
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a great deal of confusion
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
I just went on my phone to look up the
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
final proposal which I
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
studied for many hours last night I
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
pulled it up on the department of Ed
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
website now I don't even know if that's
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
really the final proposal I don't know
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
anymore I am I am very confused and I am
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
very Adept at understanding this process
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
ed360 6 and that does apply to this
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
second half the back half uh the Arts
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
curricular framework um I was uh the
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
lead for that for the 2001 curricular
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
framework which is um referenced in the
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
final proposal of the Ed 306
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
standards that's a curricular framework
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
identifies proficiency standards by the
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
end of grade four by the end of grade 8
 
02:00:49.510 --> 02:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
and by the end of grade
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
12 that is a document by which local
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
school districts are then to build a
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
sequential and systematic
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
curriculum and those are targets at end
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
of those grade levels my concern as I
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
ed360 they do not have to offer to all
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
students a sequential opportunity for
 
02:01:21.119 --> 02:01:22.629 align:start position:0%
students a sequential opportunity for
learning

02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
learning
 
02:01:25.229 --> 02:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
in any of our content
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
areas through and if this is the input
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
system this current version also changes
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
language from will provide to the local
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
school board will ensure well how does
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
one measure an insurance how if it's our
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
input system why aren't we asking local
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
school boards to provide rather than
 
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
just ensure and words really do matter
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
and these are concerns I have looking at
 
02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
it from someone with over 20 years of
 
02:01:58.950 --> 02:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
experience going into schools and
 
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
reviewing for adequacy and reviewing
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
schools against minimum standards how
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
might we Pro are in
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh measure those
 
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:15.050 align:start position:0%
inputs so I do believe there are many
 
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:16.229 align:start position:0%
inputs so I do believe there are many
[Music]

02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
um many strong aspects I have I also
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
know that the state has been on a
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
trajectory of Competency Based education
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
for 25 years and the standards as I read
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
the final proposal are a continuation of
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
that pathway for competency-based
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
education I still believe there is
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
confusion about what is Competency Based
 
02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
education and I do believe that there is
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
no rollout plan that the department has
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
win and win these standards because
 
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
eventually they will pass there needs to
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
be better communication about the whole
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
concept of these standards what these
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
mean to schools and communities what
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
these opportunities are for students and
 
02:03:07.950 --> 02:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
how this makes uh um is progress because
 
02:03:09.870 --> 02:03:09.880 align:start position:0%
the standards as they were were pretty
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
darn good and so to make changes that
 
02:03:15.189 --> 02:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
represent something more of a
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
reimagining of our standards I think
 
02:03:20.069 --> 02:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
takes more effort from the Department of
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
Education and I would be very interested
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
in seeing the uh the sequence the
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
Cadence of Standards academic standards
 
02:03:32.109 --> 02:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
revision um that would be very important
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
to include in a rollout plan and a
 
02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
communication tool I thank you very much
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
for your time I appreciate the
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak thank
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.199 --> 02:03:55.069 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:03:55.069 --> 02:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
I and I think it would be uh useful if
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
the Board of Education were to publish
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
their schedule of updates to those
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.390 --> 02:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
Rumble thank you madam chair and uh
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee like the
 
02:04:23.950 --> 02:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
previous guests I was prepared to speak
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
about part one with new arguments about
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
the most recent regulations and was not
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity but I will respect
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
what's happened and just go right on to
 
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
part two part two also suffers from the
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
fact that it doesn't comply with New
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statutes New Hampshire
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
statutes require that schools shall
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
provide instruction and also that they
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
shall use an input-based accountability
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
system the proposed regulations do
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
neither of those two things so first of
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
all the current regulations and statutes
 
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
require that students that rather that
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
schools provide instruction that's the
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
how curriculum that's the what and
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
teachers that is the who for each
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
subject in this thing you'll see there's
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
13 subjects it's broken down into an a a
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
b and a c the a is the elementary the B
 
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
is the middle and the C is the high
 
02:05:20.510 --> 02:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
school the proposed regulations remove
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
the requirement of a program that
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
provides instruction and replaces it
 
02:05:29.149 --> 02:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
instead with learning opportunities
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
offered so what is the difference the
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum is the what the curriculum is
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
a list of topics ideas and materials it
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
has no action without instruction which
 
02:05:41.270 --> 02:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
means the presence of Educators and who
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
is an educator under the regulations
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
under the current regulations that
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
educator must be a teacher that's in
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
30602 definition of educator because it
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
refers should write over to another
 
02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
statute that is solely for teachers
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
under the proposed regulation an
 
02:05:59.589 --> 02:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
educator can be a teacher or a par
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
professional so the first thing these
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
new regulations do is get rid of the
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
role of teachers the second thing is
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
that instruction is the how which is
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
done by Educators it's led by teachers
 
02:06:12.510 --> 02:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
these regulations get rid of instruction
 
02:06:14.990 --> 02:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement that you provide
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
instruction in the the proposed
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
regulations learning opportunities is
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
what they give you as their new idea for
 
02:06:24.549 --> 02:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
the future of Education now I think
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities are great if
 
02:06:29.069 --> 02:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
they're added onto instruction from
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
teachers but to replace instruction
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
would be a major error for our state
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
they are vaguely defined how many
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities must be provided
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
to every student we have no idea and how
 
02:06:42.549 --> 02:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
many students will actually access these
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
ideas right now the regulations you have
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
give you a solid guarantee the proposal
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
regulations remove the role of the
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
teacher and they remove the role of
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
instruction now you might say what
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
statute is in
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
violation RSA
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
18924 the standard School statute says a
 
02:07:00.910 --> 02:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
few things of relevance to us first is
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
that the schools must be taught by
 
02:07:06.270 --> 02:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
teachers taught by teachers that's in
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
the statute who hold valid credentials
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
It also says a standard School shall
 
02:07:15.549 --> 02:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
provide instruction in all subjects you
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
have to provide instruction the previous
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
witness just told you the importance of
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
the word provide that's different than
 
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
offering an opportunity you have to
 
02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:25.790 align:start position:0%
offering an opportunity you have to
provide

02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
instruction sometimes this gets
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
confusing look at it this way if you're
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
taking a road trip across the country
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
you go to Google Maps you got the little
 
02:07:34.750 --> 02:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
blue line that shows you where you're
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
going that's curriculum instruction is
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
what happens at each stop along the way
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
where the teachers teach students at
 
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
stop one at stop two at stop three all
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
the way through stop 180 that's the
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
difference between curriculum and
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
instruction also the previous speaker
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned inputs I would refer you to
 
02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.390 align:start position:0%

the requirements of paragraphs 1 and two
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
of the section one is the inputs and
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
part two is the output syst outputs
 
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
means how do you assess what happened
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
what these regulations have done is put
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
everything on outputs it's entirely a
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum based on an evaluation of
 
02:08:31.149 --> 02:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
competencies but there's no guarantee
 
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
that there's any actual instruction
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
taking place there's no guarantee of
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
inputs the inputs would be removed and
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
this could have a massive implication
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
maybe in the property Rich towns it
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
won't make a big difference because
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
those towns will continue to provide all
 
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
the inputs that are needed but in the
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
property poort towns when they find out
 
02:08:49.069 --> 02:08:49.079 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to provide inputs
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
you are now endangering the education of
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
communities throughout this entire state
 
02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a major major problem
 
02:08:58.109 --> 02:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
because the future of our country
 
02:09:00.750 --> 02:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
depends upon it also I would also ask
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
you to look at a couple of other
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
regulations there's there's 13 subjects
 
02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
I mentioned there's an a a b and a c
 
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
let's just take one example just to
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
bring it bring it home mathematics let's
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
just take subo C High School mathematics
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
the current regulation has 13 things
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
that have to be provided in the program
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities planned activi
 
02:09:23.149 --> 02:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
ities concrete experiences
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary interactions sustained
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
projects interactive instruction and
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
curriculum what it's replaced with is a
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
requirement that you have a curriculum
 
02:09:36.510 --> 02:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
based on competencies that's it then it
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
says to the school boards you can use
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
the common core standard for mathematics
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
and that's fine but that's just the road
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
map there's no provision no requirement
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
that anything actually be provided it
 
02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:48.679 align:start position:0%
tells school boards if you don't like
 
02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:50.559 align:start position:0%
Common Core you can write your own how
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
many school boards in the state are
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to write their own curriculum for
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
all three levels of schools for all 13
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
subjects and then it also refers you
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
into the other two sections to a couple
 
02:10:02.069 --> 02:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
of other sections in the RS which
 
02:10:05.069 --> 02:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
provide no details no instruction no how
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
to make a satisfactory curriculum so
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
what I want to put you back to is this
 
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
the current regulations are strong they
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
require Educators be teachers and just
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
look at 30602 educator means any
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
professional employee of any school
 
02:10:21.629 --> 02:10:21.639 align:start position:0%
district who position require
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
certification by the state board
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
02:10:29.229 --> 02:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
18939 the term includes administrators
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
Specialists and teachers and if you look
 
02:10:34.350 --> 02:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
up RSA 18939 the whole section is called
 
02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
teachers how are they chosen School
 
02:10:39.629 --> 02:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
Board s select teachers in the present
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
regulations in every school right now
 
02:10:43.750 --> 02:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
you have to have teachers leading the
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
classrooms if you're going to have 25
 
02:10:47.189 --> 02:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
children you got to have at least one
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
teacher if you're going to have 50 kids
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
in a classroom you would need two
 
02:10:53.310 --> 02:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
teachers under the proposed regulations
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
you would not need two teachers because
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
a educator can be a teacher or a pair of
 
02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
professional that affects not only the
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
discussion in part one it affects the
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
discussion in part two because in part
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
two you're implementing it the who is
 
02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
the teacher without the teacher you
 
02:11:11.229 --> 02:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
can't have guaranteed quality
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
instruction I want to be clear I'm not
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
against par professionals my wife is a
 
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
lifetime special ed teacher every night
 
02:11:19.390 --> 02:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
at dinner we talk about what happened in
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
public school today in the par
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
professionals do an amazing job without
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
them the schools could not function but
 
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
it is wrong for the state to pass a law
 
02:11:29.709 --> 02:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
that would say that a par professional
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
equals a teacher and that's what you're
 
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
doing here today if that's what you want
 
02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
to do then legislature propose the bill
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
next semester next session and say we're
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to change what it means to be a
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
teacher or a par educator but to Ram it
 
02:11:44.549 --> 02:11:44.559 align:start position:0%
through through a system of regulations
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
through the back door that's not the way
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should do government I I
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe that deserves a full discussion
 
02:11:52.709 --> 02:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:52.719 --> 02:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
thank

02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.149 --> 02:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
Downey thank you madam chair for
 
02:12:13.629 --> 02:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak um at your seats
 
02:12:15.870 --> 02:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
when you came in you had two packets
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
from me um the first packet is got the
 
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
date November 21st 202 before on it if
 
02:12:23.709 --> 02:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
you could follow along in that packet
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
with me I'd be real appreciative and
 
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
that way I can keep my comments brief um
 
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
so that you can all get to lunch uh
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me this that packet is for the um
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
minimum School approval standards the
 
02:12:42.549 --> 02:12:42.559 align:start position:0%
The Madam chair the packet that's dated
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
November 21 2024 and it says to Jael car
 
02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
members yes yeah um that is my testimony
 
02:12:54.350 --> 02:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
on the second half of the rules based on
 
02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:55.589 align:start position:0%
on the second half of the rules based on
educator

02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
educator
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
feedback and then you should have a
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
second packet from me that says
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
executive summary 2023 educator review
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
sessions so you should have two packets
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
from me if you don't I've got a couple
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
extras just let me know absolutely um
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
yes I do we do have somebody else bring
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
here um if I'm not mistaken it says this
 
02:13:21.830 --> 02:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
is written testimony
 
02:13:24.549 --> 02:13:24.559 align:start position:0%
regarding the minimum School approval
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
rules we have um it says um feedback
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
relates to the minimum School approval
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
right yes we have moved on to the
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
minimum academic standards right are
 
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
these rules relative to the minimum
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
academic standards yes correct yep in
 
02:13:41.830 --> 02:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
that case your heading is wrong y thank
 
02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:43.589 align:start position:0%
that case your heading is wrong y thank
you

02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
yep so um I built this packet uh based
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
on the four objections that exist in RSA
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
541 1
 
02:13:54.189 --> 02:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
a13 um and so I'm just going to try to
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
Spotlight a few things for you you've
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
got them you can read it um I do want to
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
make a quick note though that the second
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
packet you have um is the full
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
synthesized version of the 17 I know
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
that there were 13 listening sessions I
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
ran 17 educator review sessions
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I do want to
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
clarify a point that was made by chair
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
kleene I was not tasked that word
 
02:14:24.549 --> 02:14:24.559 align:start position:0%
implies that somehow I was asked to do
 
02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
this I did was not asked to do this in
 
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
fact I was part of a working group that
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
involved um some key players through
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
State organizations aft Nea New
 
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire school
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
administrators Association and members
 
02:14:41.229 --> 02:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
of the national um Center for Competency
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
Based learning and I was part of that
 
02:14:45.549 --> 02:14:45.559 align:start position:0%
work group from November of last year
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
2023 to to January of 2024 and through
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
about a series of three me meetings of
 
02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
that group with the commissioner I
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
negotiated cuz originally when I
 
02:14:58.270 --> 02:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
proposed this idea it was met with
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
resistance that we would hold educator
 
02:15:02.189 --> 02:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
review sessions so I just want to
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that point for the public record
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
I was not tasked I actually negotiated
 
02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
and volunteered to do this um so moving
 
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
on service in that case we appreciate
 
02:15:15.750 --> 02:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
people who volunteer to do this kind of
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
dirty work yeah well I I believe it's
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
important to um protect the high quality
 
02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
of our public schools here in New
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I wanted to do this ex
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
um directly around your process and your
 
02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
four objectives and what I did in this
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
document was present for you some
 
02:15:35.149 --> 02:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
questions and some considerations that
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
you can review and think about because
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately it is your job um in terms of
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
what you do with these rules moving it
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
forward the first one is beyond the
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
authority of the agency and one of the
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
things that I want to point out in the
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
second half of this document um is this
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
conversation of um pulling out program
 
02:15:55.709 --> 02:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
language that exists in the current
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
rules and um linking them to State
 
02:16:02.350 --> 02:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
academic standards um and so one of the
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
things I would would ask you to think
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
about is that and I I do want to
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
preference my testimony is actually
 
02:16:12.830 --> 02:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
based on your gel C uh gel car packets
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
that I pulled exactly from your gelar
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
website for the November 21st meeting so
 
02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
I go to Jael car now to get the most
 
02:16:23.950 --> 02:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
up-to-dated version and so all my
 
02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
feedback is related to what you have in
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
your packets um if you take the um and
 
02:16:31.990 --> 02:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
and part of this does deal with the
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
first section so just bear with me for a
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
sec here one of the things that's coming
 
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
out in the second half of the rules is
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
this notion of taking out program uh
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
programming language and then using a
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
direct point to the State academic
 
02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
standards and so if you actually here's
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
here's one cause that I think you need
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
to ask yourself is what do we mean by
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
State academic standards and I will get
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
to there's a definition in the RSA that
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
comes later but if you just take the
 
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
current first half of the document that
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
you just approved and you do a control
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
find in that document you'll find 21
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
hits on the phrase academic standards
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what's defined in the RSA but
 
02:17:14.190 --> 02:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
here where it gets a little confusing
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
you will get hits where it's just the
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
term academic standard and it doesn't
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
clarify are we talking about state acade
 
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
mic standards or are we talking about
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
District academic standards because as
 
02:17:28.309 --> 02:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
you just heard um through David's um
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
presentation before there is leeway for
 
02:17:32.669 --> 02:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
districts to set their own standards
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
their own academic standards you then
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
will get um one more and this is an
 
02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
interesting one because you just
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
approved this in the first half of the
 
02:17:43.389 --> 02:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
role you will get a hit that clearly
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
says districts academic standards and
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
then in the new section that the
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
department of Ed added with 30620 6
 
02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
you'll get the majority of the 13 other
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
hits when you just search for that
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
academic standards that are linked to
 
02:18:00.429 --> 02:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
State academic standard but that number
 
02:18:02.669 --> 02:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
two one where it says District academic
 
02:18:04.830 --> 02:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
standards now opens up this conversation
 
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the question that I give you all to
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
think about which is does the State
 
02:18:11.709 --> 02:18:11.719 align:start position:0%
Board of Education have the authority to
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
use the State academic standards to set
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
the criteria for substantive um adequate
 
02:18:19.389 --> 02:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
education and what is stipulated in the
 
02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
RSA and rules regarding the requirement
 
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
of of of schools to implement or follow
 
02:18:27.790 --> 02:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
the State academic standards I I'm going
 
02:18:30.030 --> 02:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
to just peruse through my packet here
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
for you very quickly but on pages two
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
and three I give you some more examples
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
that that get at this gray area about
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
who has the authority on these academic
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
standards and which academic standards
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
are we talking about General academic
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
standards District academic standards or
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
State academic standards um and one of
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
the current rules that you just approved
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
which is 3064 in policy development
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
number 18 that was in the first half you
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
just app approved actually says that
 
02:19:04.150 --> 02:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
promoting students from one learning
 
02:19:06.230 --> 02:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
level or grade or another based on
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
achievement of competencies in alignment
 
02:19:11.790 --> 02:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
with the district's academic standards
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
so we have a gray area here about whose
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
academic standards are we pointing to
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
and is there that if we link these
 
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
content areas to academic standards what
 
02:19:24.030 --> 02:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
consistency do we ensure because it's
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
not clear in the RSA what the role of
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
academic standards play if you'll follow
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
along with me and go to page three in my
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
packet what I do think that you start to
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
get clarity of in terms of the RSA is
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
that it's really clear and I would draw
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
your attention on page three to
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph five where it starts with RSA
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
193 E2 that it becomes very clear from
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
the RSA perspective that we're talking
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
about the minimum standards for public
 
02:19:53.399 --> 02:19:54.429 align:start position:0%
about the minimum standards for public
school

02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:19:58.510 --> 02:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
approval setting the criteria for AC for
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
educational programs educational
 
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
programs it doesn't say set the criteria
 
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
for for academic standards it says for
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
educational program and then on that
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
same page three if you go up to the top
 
02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph you have all the definitions
 
02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
there laid out including the new
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
definition that you just approved in the
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
first half on program
 
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
so on page three you can see all those
 
02:20:25.469 --> 02:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
definitions because that RSA is
 
02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
specifically spelling out those
 
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
definitions there's you can't make an
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
assumption that one thing means the same
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
and I can use them like synonyms they're
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
defined very specifically and here's
 
02:20:38.910 --> 02:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
what I also draw your attention to
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's come up recently in discussion
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
with the passage of House Bill
 
02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
1107 and the implementation of the state
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks if you look at the
 
02:20:51.070 --> 02:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
definition of what the state curriculum
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
framework says currently in the RSA that
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
got approved is that it will say an
 
02:20:57.990 --> 02:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
organized plan of study that serves as a
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
guide and reference to what New
 
02:21:01.150 --> 02:21:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students should know and be
 
02:21:03.389 --> 02:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
able to do in a learning area and
 
02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
identifies the academic standards
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
aligned to the learning area Okay so the
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
question has been where exactly do the
 
02:21:14.830 --> 02:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
State academic standards live because up
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
above State academic standards are
 
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
simply means what students should know
 
02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
and be able to do here's where you get a
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
little um I think something you're going
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
to need to talk about is we also know in
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
the new RSA that um integrated
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks into it that it
 
02:21:33.990 --> 02:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
also says the curriculum Frameworks are
 
02:21:36.110 --> 02:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
not meant to be a state
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
curriculum and that means schools don't
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
have to follow this so follow my I'm a
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
I'm a mathematics teacher by trade in my
 
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
former day so logic model is something I
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
live by but if you follow my logic here
 
02:21:50.630 --> 02:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
that curriculum Frameworks include what
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
students know and be able to do and by
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the very definition in the RSA academic
 
02:21:57.349 --> 02:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
standards Define what students know and
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
be able to do then one could make the
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
connection our State academic standards
 
02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
live in our curriculum Frameworks but
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
yet our curriculum Frameworks would not
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
be mandated to our
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
schools I I want that to set for a
 
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
minute okay so moving on um I I'm going
 
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
to point you to page five there's I've
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
given you some more pause to think about
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
what the RSA language says and what's
 
02:22:28.270 --> 02:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
being proposed in the rules and that was
 
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
to helped you with that first objection
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
area of beond beyond the authority of
 
02:22:34.870 --> 02:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
the agency but I have a list of
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
conclusions here that I'm just reading
 
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
through them that I draw as a lay person
 
02:22:42.270 --> 02:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
a 30-year educator doing this business
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
and for about 50% of that 30 years I've
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
been a district level curriculum
 
02:22:50.110 --> 02:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
director I lead curriculum instruction
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
assess and professional de development
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
in districts across New Hampshire like
 
02:22:56.590 --> 02:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
my counterpart Marsha good to see you
 
02:22:58.750 --> 02:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
marer I also was at the Department of
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
Education during that time with Marsha
 
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
as the mathematics
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
consultant um but my conclusions are
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
there and I think one of the couple of
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
things that I want to point out to you
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
in that conclusion is this inconsistency
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
about to play between program what is a
 
02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
program academic standards and
 
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks and we know in the
 
02:23:22.910 --> 02:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
RSA the RSA clearly says that the
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
approval set they Define an adequate
 
02:23:32.349 --> 02:23:32.359 align:start position:0%
education for educational programs a
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
program an academic standard and a
 
02:23:36.990 --> 02:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
curriculum framework are not the same
 
02:23:38.150 --> 02:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
thing and I'm going to tell you that
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
from my experience of over 50% of my
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
career of being a curriculum
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
director here's the easiest way that I'm
 
02:23:48.070 --> 02:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
going to try to do it academic standards
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
do one thing for us and that's simply
 
02:23:51.870 --> 02:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
tell us what do we want students to know
 
02:23:55.990 --> 02:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
and be able to do a program will answer
 
02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
what we call Four essential questions
 
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
and they are what do we want students to
 
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
know and be able to do how are we going
 
02:24:07.389 --> 02:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
to measure report and track uh sorry
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
check the progress of our students so
 
02:24:12.110 --> 02:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
that we know they're making the progress
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
they need to be number three what do we
 
02:24:17.309 --> 02:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
do for students that go above and beyond
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
our expectations how do we provide that
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
personaliz ation that you approved in
 
02:24:23.710 --> 02:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
the first half and the fourth question
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
is what do we do for our students who
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
may be challenged or may be struggling
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
that's a program there's a difference
 
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
between using rules to outline a program
 
02:24:36.910 --> 02:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
that is set to Define an adequate
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
education and then simply changing those
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
rules to academic standards you lose so
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
much more in the consistency and the
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
high quality uh public school education
 
02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
that I believe the state wants
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
so you'll have my conclusions there on
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
page five and then I bring you to
 
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
objection number two category objection
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
number two category is based on the
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
contrary to the intent of the
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislature I think we've talked about
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
this a couple of times already but I'm
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
not going to belabor it but there are
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
some very pointed contradictions to
 
02:25:16.429 --> 02:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
State legislation in the areas of
 
02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:19.160 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy and logic and
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
rhetoric and I would would really
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read them in both cases
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
the rsas are clear that these do not
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
need to be Standalone classes that now
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
serve as additional credits for
 
02:25:35.990 --> 02:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
graduation the rsas are very clear about
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
making these integrated applicable um
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
sub uh topics across other areas as well
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
and and while in public um meetings I
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
have heard the department say well we're
 
02:25:50.590 --> 02:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
not going to prevent anybody from that
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
that's great to say it in public but if
 
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to actually be the practice
 
02:25:56.830 --> 02:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
then let's get that in the rules and
 
02:25:59.070 --> 02:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
make it clear that yeah they could be
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
Standalone credits but they could be
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
integrated and applied and let's be
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
clear about that I think the other thing
 
02:26:07.469 --> 02:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
that comes out of play and this is
 
02:26:09.429 --> 02:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
really on the bottom of seven in the top
 
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
of page eight of my report is this
 
02:26:14.510 --> 02:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
notion the rules are going to expire
 
02:26:16.830 --> 02:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
there's been General consensus around
 
02:26:19.110 --> 02:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
the rules you know in the 10-year review
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
cycle if you go to the actual these are
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
the effect dates that exist in the
 
02:26:27.550 --> 02:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
current rules for the areas that we are
 
02:26:29.550 --> 02:26:29.560 align:start position:0%
talking about you will see that there
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
are seven areas that do need immediate
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
attention I'm not going to disagree
 
02:26:37.389 --> 02:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
agree with Julie at all on that um and I
 
02:26:38.950 --> 02:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
think there are ways that we can get to
 
02:26:41.469 --> 02:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
them pretty quickly but then the next
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
set of rules in here don't aren't due to
 
02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
expire till
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
2026 so go back to the RSA and if the
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 19 3E tells us that the job of the
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
minimum School approval standards is to
 
02:26:57.870 --> 02:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
maintain the high quality of our public
 
02:26:59.710 --> 02:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
schools and it's in there it says that
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
the phrase high quality is used there
 
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
then let's use this time to make sure we
 
02:27:09.110 --> 02:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
have that I'm going to continue on on
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
page nine you have my proposal that on
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
three different occasions I sent it in
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
March of 2023 I sent it in April of 2024
 
02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
and then again in July of 2024 my
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
proposal of actually how to do working
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
review sessions with Educators and to
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
beef up the rules based on this timeline
 
02:27:30.630 --> 02:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
right here so that you have that on
 
02:27:34.269 --> 02:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
pages 7 to 11 that's objection number
 
02:27:36.830 --> 02:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
two that you could deploy objection
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
number three is based on determined not
 
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
in the public interest we've heard a lot
 
02:27:45.630 --> 02:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
about that today given that RSA 541
 
02:27:47.469 --> 02:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
really doesn't give us much guidance
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
right now I agree um with the
 
02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
representative who said that the current
 
02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
house bill that goes into effect doesn't
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
go into effect till December so we don't
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
really have too much guidance we have
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
some guidance on what we Define as
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
public interest right but one would
 
02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
think that when it comes to public
 
02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
interest you'd want to have the feedback
 
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
of your public school Educators so what
 
02:28:09.389 --> 02:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
you're looking here on the page I'm on
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
page 12 on page 12 what you're looking
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
at are the five options that I proposed
 
02:28:19.269 --> 02:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
in my educator review sessions um I had
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
close to now 300 Educators if you put
 
02:28:24.030 --> 02:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
all 17 of my sessions together I had a
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
break I did some in the fall of 2023 in
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
sept um August and September and then I
 
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
did another round in March of 2024 your
 
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
grass not in color but I did send every
 
02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
member of this committee a digital copy
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
of this earlier this week so you have
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
the color version of it but so you have
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
the graph the
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
84.9% of Educators who participated in
 
02:28:48.190 --> 02:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
these re review sessions picked option
 
02:28:50.429 --> 02:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
number five you can't see the because
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's black and white and then the
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
15.1% picked option number four 0% of
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
the Educators I worked with picked
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
options one two or three in terms of
 
02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
completely pulling rule language about
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
programs out of the minimum standards
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
for public school approval and hoping
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
they would land in State academic
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
standards nobody was in favor of that
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay um so here's what I do want to say
 
02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
I know there was comment earlier today
 
02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
about you know
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
um the the the the rules that are
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
contained in the content areas and um
 
02:29:32.349 --> 02:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
how some of the content areas we don't
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually have State academic standards
 
02:29:37.630 --> 02:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
for um and so I wanted to give you
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
samples so Pages 13 through in my report
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
and these are only samples um I have all
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the materials from the Educators on all
 
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
the content areas but if you actually go
 
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
through pages
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
13 through 28 those are samples and what
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
I set up for you in this was um in for
 
02:30:02.190 --> 02:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
example I'm going to just use 13 as my
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
um guide to help guide you through these
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
pages is I took the content area digital
 
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
literacy now this is an interesting one
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
because we don't have State academic
 
02:30:12.910 --> 02:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
standards for digital literacy and what
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
I gave you is the educator feedback and
 
02:30:18.309 --> 02:30:18.319 align:start position:0%
I have to tell you I had probably 20 to
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
25 folks throughout the state in my
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
sessions just focus on digital literacy
 
02:30:26.830 --> 02:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
and they they rewrote the rules one of
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
the things I've heard come back to me is
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
that when I sent things to the
 
02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed people quickly scanned
 
02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
the rules and said well they didn't want
 
02:30:35.710 --> 02:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
to make any changes that is not true and
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
I have evidence in my document to show
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
you that um so they rewrote these rules
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
on the brand new 2024 national istd
 
02:30:47.469 --> 02:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
standards for citizenship in digital
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
literacy and so you will see on page
 
02:30:54.030 --> 02:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
13 through I believe it's 15 to the
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
middle of 16 those were the rules those
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
Educators came up with in fact I will
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
point out to you on page 14 numbers one
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to 15 to number seven are the
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
components of those National IST
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
standards they didn't copy them word for
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
word they synthesized them so they would
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
make sense and these are Educators so if
 
02:31:17.550 --> 02:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to make sense to our
 
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
Educators that's important because then
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to be the ones that can
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
deliver that education to our students
 
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then on page 16 you will see what
 
02:31:28.309 --> 02:31:28.319 align:start position:0%
ended up in the proposed rules
 
02:31:30.510 --> 02:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
okay and you can see that all the way
 
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
through I would point out that PE which
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
is PE and health which are one of the
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
older sets of our current State academic
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
standards the teachers went through and
 
02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
vamped those up to the to the also brand
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
new 2024 National shape
 
02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
standards and you'll see those all the
 
02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
way through uh page 19
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
um I will point out that I had a huge
 
02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
group from the school Psychological
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
Services and our n our state
 
02:31:58.950 --> 02:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
organizations and they put together
 
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:01.240 align:start position:0%
their rules that should be exist so
 
02:32:03.269 --> 02:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
following every example of educator you
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
then have this is what is being proposed
 
02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the um minimum standards for public
 
02:32:11.070 --> 02:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
school approval um if you go to page 23
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
please those are the ELA rules and and
 
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
as we know those are common core driven
 
02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
but I I wanted to leave the Integrity of
 
02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
the review process in place so I didn't
 
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
clean these up I had told Cher uh
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
chairman Klein that I did not feel as a
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
single individual it was my authority on
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
any Authority authoritative level to go
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
through and then synthesize this
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
educator work and and put a best guess
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
forward that's why in July once again I
 
02:32:41.230 --> 02:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
put forward the proposal of how to bring
 
02:32:43.389 --> 02:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
smaller groups of educator together to
 
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
then come and synthesize a compromised
 
02:32:48.110 --> 02:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
version of the rules that they would
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
recommend I left this in so they that
 
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
you can see they had cross outs they had
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
changes they had additions to it and
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
then you'll see if you go to page
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
25 these were the personal finance
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
literacy rules proposed and again this
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
one's interesting there are no State
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
academic standards for personal finance
 
02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
literacy so there's a concern right out
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the gate remember included in the
 
02:33:14.389 --> 02:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
first half that you just approved is an
 
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
additional half credit Standalone
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy with with no
 
02:33:23.309 --> 02:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
State academic standards to guide what
 
02:33:25.710 --> 02:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
that is going to look like in our
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
schools I'm going to let that set for a
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
minute the Educators provided it you can
 
02:33:33.910 --> 02:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
see the proposed rules here not a bad
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
match on this one I will I will give
 
02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
full credit to that um but a nice step
 
02:33:40.750 --> 02:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
in this process would have been hey
 
02:33:42.190 --> 02:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
here's what all the different groups
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
came up with let's bring another working
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
group together let's meld it does this
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
make sense and then we've got consensus
 
02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
on it right on page 20
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
s there is the logic and rhetoric again
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
this is concerning in what you just
 
02:33:59.550 --> 02:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
approved you just approved
 
02:34:02.269 --> 02:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
Standalone half Credit in logic and
 
02:34:04.990 --> 02:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
rhetoric and there are no State academic
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
standards for this area now good news is
 
02:34:10.630 --> 02:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
we had some groups tackle this it wasn't
 
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
easy because we had to do a lot of
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
research first around what's out there
 
02:34:15.710 --> 02:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
what's the nation doing and there were
 
02:34:17.309 --> 02:34:17.319 align:start position:0%
two versions and I didn't want to
 
02:34:19.870 --> 02:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
Discount I didn't want to make an a a
 
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
authoritative decision on which version
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
was better or not so I gave you both
 
02:34:25.269 --> 02:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
versions and then you can see what was
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
proposed in the rules to Define logic
 
02:34:27.920 --> 02:34:28.870 align:start position:0%
proposed in the rules to Define logic
and

02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
rhetoric so conclusion here on your um
 
02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
objection number three is determined to
 
02:34:38.670 --> 02:34:38.680 align:start position:0%
be in the public best interest I think
 
02:34:40.870 --> 02:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
there are enough questions here for you
 
02:34:43.950 --> 02:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
to to consider that when you decide your
 
02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
action that you're going to take the
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
last objection area is deemed by the
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
committee to have a substantial economic
 
02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
imp impact um I just pulled out this one
 
02:34:54.349 --> 02:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
area there were a few other areas but I
 
02:34:56.429 --> 02:34:56.439 align:start position:0%
I wanted to keep this as manageable as I
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
could um and I did the the the quickest
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
comparison was the changes specifically
 
02:35:03.309 --> 02:35:03.319 align:start position:0%
in the social studies area in the
 
02:35:04.990 --> 02:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
credits for graduation and keep in mind
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
you just approve those changes in the
 
02:35:09.590 --> 02:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
first half of the document so you have
 
02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
approved now a change in how social
 
02:35:14.070 --> 02:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
studies courses were 2.5 credits for
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
graduation are now five credits you've
 
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
doubled that that has to have an impact
 
02:35:22.750 --> 02:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
on Staffing and scheduling at any high
 
02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
school with no cost implications behind
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
it so I'm I'm here for questions um
 
02:35:33.550 --> 02:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your time and for me
 
02:35:35.469 --> 02:35:35.479 align:start position:0%
willing to present that
 
02:35:41.309 --> 02:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:00.030 --> 02:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
hello thank you madam chair for taking
 
02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
my comments there my name is Shan par I
 
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
am the uh represent a representative
 
02:36:08.670 --> 02:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
from Manchester's Board of school
 
02:36:10.950 --> 02:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee and I do speak on behalf of
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
our school board today I am the chair of
 
02:36:15.550 --> 02:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
the education legislation committee and
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
I have followed this process for almost
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
two years now
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
I have been uh I'm I should also say I
 
02:36:24.950 --> 02:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
am an educator as well I'm a professor
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
at St anom college so I am quite aware
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
of the stakes of these changes to the
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
rules uh I'll try not to repeat things
 
02:36:37.269 --> 02:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
but I think it is important to go on the
 
02:36:40.110 --> 02:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
record that even just today there were
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
two falsehoods that were stated multiple
 
02:36:45.790 --> 02:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
times that should be corrected one is
 
02:36:47.469 --> 02:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education website
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
does not have the most current version
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
of these rules on its website there that
 
02:36:54.590 --> 02:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
is not possible for someone from the
 
02:36:56.910 --> 02:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
public to access on the website so that
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
is false two uh there's been there were
 
02:37:04.269 --> 02:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
many claims made about uh the class size
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
issue and that the wording in the
 
02:37:08.469 --> 02:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
revised version is the same as the
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
wording in the current version and
 
02:37:13.070 --> 02:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's also false the header of the new
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
section talks about student educator
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
ratios uh and the original stated class
 
02:37:21.790 --> 02:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
size maximum and the class size is very
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
different from student educator ratios
 
02:37:26.110 --> 02:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
our district has been very careful in
 
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
defining these things very specifically
 
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
in our own policies we feel it's very
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
important the research shows very
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
clearly that class size is much more
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
important than student educator ratios
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
that actually having a room with 20
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
students in it and one teacher is far
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
better than having a room with 40
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
students in it and two teachers or a
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
teacher in a parah that research is
 
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
substantial and clear and so we have
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
striven to continue that emphasis on
 
02:37:55.030 --> 02:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
class size rather than student educator
 
02:37:57.790 --> 02:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
ratios and if you look at the language
 
02:37:59.950 --> 02:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
of the rules that you just approved it
 
02:38:02.030 --> 02:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
is substantially different from the
 
02:38:03.750 --> 02:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
current language and I think it's really
 
02:38:05.550 --> 02:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
important that that go on the record
 
02:38:08.269 --> 02:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
because that is something that uh was
 
02:38:09.910 --> 02:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
discussed several times and several
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.510 --> 02:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
that with regard to the second half of
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
the rules we would Echo
 
02:38:21.870 --> 02:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
the comments from David Trumble that
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
these subject area requirements have
 
02:38:25.510 --> 02:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
indeed been watered down Marsha mcaffrey
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
also pointed out many Salient points
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
about the Arts and uh how these
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are not mandated but
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
suggested Frameworks for schools to
 
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
follow and I think it's important that
 
02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
we understand that that means that
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
districts can make choices to opt out of
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
offerings many of these things to opt
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
out of programming a real systematic
 
02:38:51.269 --> 02:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
framework or systematic program of study
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
for our students in public
 
02:38:55.630 --> 02:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
schools I would also point out that uh
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
our board has been particularly active
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
and we have been quite grateful we've
 
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
been uh lucky enough to have a visit
 
02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
from commissioner edbl himself he came
 
02:39:04.750 --> 02:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
to one of our Schoolboard meetings we
 
02:39:06.550 --> 02:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
have held our own forums where Fred
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
veronte came and and spoke with us there
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
we've been very active in asking
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
questions involving the public as much
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
as we could we have given our feedback
 
02:39:16.990 --> 02:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
several times to the State Board of
 
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
Education both in person and in writing
 
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
all of our letters have been unanimously
 
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
approved by our board we have a robust
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
strong board with lots of different
 
02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
opinions uh I think I can say safely
 
02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
that it's a bipartisan board and for all
 
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
of us to unanimously approve these
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
letters of concern about the rules
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
changes speaks very strongly to uh a
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
coming together of understanding the
 
02:39:42.670 --> 02:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
stakes of these minimum standards and
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
the changes that are being made uh as
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
for making sure that we're talking about
 
02:39:49.950 --> 02:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
the current versions there I can State
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
very specifically that several of our
 
02:39:54.349 --> 02:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
concerns remain in addition to the
 
02:39:57.349 --> 02:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
class- siiz maximum concern we also have
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
been very concerned about the vague
 
02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
language changes especially the learning
 
02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities the phrase learning
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the phrase learning
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
levels and we feel very strongly that
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
these changes are too vaguely defined
 
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
and uh water down the the minimum
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
standards for Education here we have
 
02:40:17.309 --> 02:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
argued from the beginning from March of
 
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
2023 that it's been important for for
 
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
direct instruction to be fundamental to
 
02:40:25.309 --> 02:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
minimum education standards and that
 
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
ideas of learning opportunities and
 
02:40:29.150 --> 02:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
learning levels do not cover that
 
02:40:30.910 --> 02:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
instruction uh I would say two things
 
02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to your committee jel car I
 
02:40:38.349 --> 02:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
know that you have very specific rules
 
02:40:40.590 --> 02:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
about when you can object there and I
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
think from our perspective as a board
 
02:40:44.990 --> 02:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
public interest and fiscal impact are
 
02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
the two concerns that we still have that
 
02:40:49.309 --> 02:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
your your committee has the power to
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
raise objections to public interest has
 
02:40:54.190 --> 02:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
not been addressed uh the the feedback
 
02:40:56.990 --> 02:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
has been ignored we have we have called
 
02:40:58.790 --> 02:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
attention to this many times over the
 
02:41:00.910 --> 02:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
last two years we feel that many
 
02:41:03.070 --> 02:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
Educators stakeholders and our entire
 
02:41:04.630 --> 02:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
school school district has been
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
disregarded uh with regard to our
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
concerns we have uh we have been very
 
02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
consistent in our
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
feedback in a way this erodes trust
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
right I mean public interest is not just
 
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
well we have concerns you're not
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
listening to them public interest is
 
02:41:23.710 --> 02:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
also we need to trust that the State
 
02:41:26.230 --> 02:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Education cares about the
 
02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
feedback of Educators and school
 
02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
districts we need to trust that when
 
02:41:31.510 --> 02:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
they say something is available to the
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
public that it's available to the public
 
02:41:36.030 --> 02:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
we need to trust that when they say
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
learning opportunities are the same as
 
02:41:39.230 --> 02:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
direct instruction well we need
 
02:41:40.910 --> 02:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
definitions that really show that and
 
02:41:42.990 --> 02:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
prove that right so trust has really
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
been eroded in this case and there's a
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
reason why there are so many of us who
 
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
are upset that we couldn't speak before
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
the first part part of this hearing
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
there are so many of us that are
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
objecting the work that Christine
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
Downing has done to involve hundreds of
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
Educators on her own not at the behest
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education that
 
02:42:02.349 --> 02:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be happening that shouldn't be
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
necessary the Department of Education
 
02:42:06.190 --> 02:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
should be doing that work they should be
 
02:42:08.990 --> 02:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
adhering to that sense of reach Outreach
 
02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
and trying to find ways to bring
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
Educators to the table so that these
 
02:42:15.030 --> 02:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
rules really do reflect the best
 
02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
interests of our students here in New
 
02:42:19.710 --> 02:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire finally
 
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact this was touched upon by
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
Christine Downing and others I think
 
02:42:26.230 --> 02:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
that what has been maybe a little bit
 
02:42:28.590 --> 02:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
less mentioned is that the vagueness in
 
02:42:31.550 --> 02:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
terms of District versus State academic
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
standards that uh the definition of
 
02:42:36.790 --> 02:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding is very much linked to
 
02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
these minimum standards and what is
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
required there so if class size is
 
02:42:43.349 --> 02:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
changed because it's not a maximum but a
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
student teacher ratio if academic
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
standards are
 
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistently uh referred to Via
 
02:42:52.830 --> 02:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
District or State versus District or
 
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
state standards uh and if we have a
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
sense that these subject area program
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
requirements are now just Frameworks
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
that may be applicable then that is
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
affecting what the minimum the minimum
 
02:43:08.550 --> 02:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
standards do affect what an adequate
 
02:43:10.110 --> 02:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
education should be funded how it should
 
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
be funded there and so I think it's
 
02:43:14.389 --> 02:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
really important that there be a a a a
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
deeper look at what the fiscal impact is
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
of these rule changes these are large
 
02:43:21.550 --> 02:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
large scale changes they have a fiscal
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
impact they open the path for serious
 
02:43:27.150 --> 02:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
cuts to public education funding and I
 
02:43:28.269 --> 02:43:28.279 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that this
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
committee speaks out about this uh we're
 
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
just a hop skip and a jump from Arizona
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
who's done things like this Incorporated
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
Universal vouchers and now has like A1
 
02:43:41.670 --> 02:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
billion deficit I mean this is this is
 
02:43:43.950 --> 02:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
this is the direction with these rules
 
02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is very fiscally irresponsible to
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
pass these rules without investigating
 
02:43:50.110 --> 02:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
the the consequences the changes there
 
02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
so I I feel very strongly about this our
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
board has discussed this many times and
 
02:43:56.790 --> 02:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer
 
02:43:59.269 --> 02:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
02:43:59.279 --> 02:44:00.830 align:start position:0%
questions thank

02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:38.830 --> 02:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:43.150 --> 02:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
you hello my name is GI jel I'm u a
 
02:44:45.590 --> 02:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
parent of two in the O River Cooperative
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
school district and I'm also here as a
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative of the O River for uh
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
District School
 
02:44:54.550 --> 02:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
Board I a lot of the things I was going
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
to speak about have already been touched
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
on so I don't necessarily want to repeat
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
them um the previous gentleman before me
 
02:45:02.070 --> 02:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually said many of them but
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
considering what jel car is actually
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
limited to um the two things I really
 
02:45:07.309 --> 02:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
want to talk about again is the public
 
02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
interest and also fiscal impact first of
 
02:45:13.190 --> 02:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
all there's a huge problem with actually
 
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
the clarity of this um I was actually
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
spending time during the first when we
 
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
were discussing the first half of these
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
rules about verifying that these
 
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
information was readily available on the
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education website and it
 
02:45:28.349 --> 02:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
simply isn't and hasn't been um the most
 
02:45:30.269 --> 02:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
recent rules aren't there it's true I
 
02:45:31.990 --> 02:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
can find them under jel car but that's
 
02:45:33.950 --> 02:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
not under the Department of Education I
 
02:45:35.790 --> 02:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
only see if it pops up in your guys'
 
02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
packets so that's one thing there um
 
02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
public interest has to be served by the
 
02:45:45.190 --> 02:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
ability to read and understand it um
 
02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
secondly I want to address something
 
02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
that was in the first half of the rules
 
02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
regarding the availabil of the
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
information regarding public hearing
 
02:45:53.950 --> 02:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
sessions on this um I went to the first
 
02:45:56.830 --> 02:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing session led by uh banti
 
02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
um like two years ago that was actually
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
hosted at the orer River High School and
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
there was no information provided about
 
02:46:06.510 --> 02:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
these regulations whatsoever they
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
weren't there he just talked a lot about
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
how awesome he was in competence based
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
education for two hours it was not an
 
02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
education for two hours it was not an
informative

02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
informative
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
session so that did not address what was
 
02:46:19.510 --> 02:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
happening here because
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
public interest was not served I
 
02:46:22.269 --> 02:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
actually went at the end of that meeting
 
02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
and actually asked him um what if you
 
02:46:27.150 --> 02:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
guys considered the fiscal impact of the
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
changes in these regulations and he told
 
02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:30.950 align:start position:0%
changes in these regulations and he told
me

02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
no so right from the GetGo these things
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
were not considering the fiscal impact
 
02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
and as a school board
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
member the fiscal impact is incredibly
 
02:46:42.269 --> 02:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
important um so I don't want to
 
02:46:43.389 --> 02:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
reiterate some of things people were
 
02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
saying but also again it's the the
 
02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding and the link to it to
 
02:46:49.750 --> 02:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
me is pivotally important no the class
 
02:46:52.429 --> 02:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
size maximum and class size ratios are
 
02:46:55.150 --> 02:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
not the same right now in our school
 
02:46:57.150 --> 02:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
district we are having an issue with the
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
fact that our kindergarten population
 
02:47:01.230 --> 02:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
exploded and we're actually having to
 
02:47:02.349 --> 02:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
figure out how we're going to actually
 
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
add classrooms onto the current
 
02:47:06.269 --> 02:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
elementary schools we have and a lot
 
02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely linked to the fact
 
02:47:10.429 --> 02:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
that we have limits on how many kids fit
 
02:47:12.269 --> 02:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
in the classroom that's not just fire
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
code it's actually talking about how
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
well a kid is actually educated and so
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're having to figure out how we're
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
going to pay for that to make sure that
 
02:47:20.190 --> 02:47:20.200 align:start position:0%
we fit these standards it's in our
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
policy and we are actually quite
 
02:47:23.389 --> 02:47:23.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that there is a difference
 
02:47:25.349 --> 02:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
between having an educator in the
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
classroom who is a teacher and an
 
02:47:29.110 --> 02:47:29.120 align:start position:0%
educator who's a PA
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
professional so there's that there um
 
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
another concern we have that I'll
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
reiterate from other folks again is that
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
the learning opportunities learning
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
levels versus direct instruction is
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
pivotally important it's definitely a
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
watering down one of the things that I
 
02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
actually have a concern about is that
 
02:47:46.670 --> 02:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
that language makes it essentially that
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
a school district becomes a
 
02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
credentialing Center rather than a
 
02:47:54.030 --> 02:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
teaching Center and the difference of
 
02:47:55.190 --> 02:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
that is is that with these learning
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities including the learning
 
02:47:58.750 --> 02:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere program is that it makes it
 
02:48:01.630 --> 02:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
so a school district is responsible for
 
02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
an outside agency's teaching even though
 
02:48:06.349 --> 02:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
the school district had nothing to do
 
02:48:08.510 --> 02:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
with it they're providing something but
 
02:48:09.870 --> 02:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
we're the ones who are supposed to be
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
evaluating it and assessing it and a lot
 
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
that language of like how you do
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
assessments and what's considered under
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
that has actually been removed under the
 
02:48:19.150 --> 02:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
second half of the rules they it's not
 
02:48:21.150 --> 02:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
there and so we're responsible for
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
something but actually have no ownership
 
02:48:26.910 --> 02:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
and control over it um so again I I want
 
02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
to point out learning opportunities
 
02:48:29.230 --> 02:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
learning levels is not equivalent to
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
direct instruction and that go goes
 
02:48:33.630 --> 02:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
again to the insur then provide uh
 
02:48:35.710 --> 02:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
language that again is
 
02:48:38.110 --> 02:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
problematic um one of the things that I
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
find concerning is that I think some
 
02:48:42.349 --> 02:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned this earlier is that
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
competencies have not been very clearly
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
defined by anybody everybody's working
 
02:48:48.429 --> 02:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
very hard on trying to figure out what
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
those mean and how you're going to teach
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
it and there's a huge amount that
 
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
actually our district right now is
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
working on professional development and
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
how to make it s our assessments
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
actually assess censes it is extremely
 
02:49:02.230 --> 02:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
difficult work and when you make it so
 
02:49:04.070 --> 02:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
the standards are removed in these rules
 
02:49:05.670 --> 02:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it just becomes competencies you're
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
putting actually a tremendous burden
 
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
onto each individual district and each
 
02:49:11.950 --> 02:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
individual teacher and administrator Etc
 
02:49:14.030 --> 02:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
to try and figure out what it's going to
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
mean by removing guidance you've
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually put a tremendous burden
 
02:49:18.720 --> 02:49:20.269 align:start position:0%
actually put a tremendous burden
particularly

02:49:20.269 --> 02:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
financially onto the districts as I said
 
02:49:24.510 --> 02:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
where we actually just hired people we
 
02:49:26.110 --> 02:49:26.120 align:start position:0%
hired a consultancy firm to try and
 
02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
actually deal with this issue because
 
02:49:28.910 --> 02:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the guidance from
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere every district is having to
 
02:49:32.910 --> 02:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel here which means that
 
02:49:37.309 --> 02:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
is an incredible fiscal impact that's
 
02:49:37.319 --> 02:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
is an incredible fiscal impact that's
ongoing

02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
um and I guess the last thing to go
 
02:49:45.229 --> 02:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
through is again is that the the
 
02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
question about who has the authority on
 
02:49:48.950 --> 02:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
academic standards I I think is there
 
02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
really needs to be looked at um Miss
 
02:49:53.469 --> 02:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
Downing really addressed that
 
02:49:56.030 --> 02:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
um that's basically a summary of that I
 
02:49:58.550 --> 02:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
can answer any questions if I'm
 
02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.950 --> 02:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
you sir if you'd like to uh come up I
 
02:50:19.630 --> 02:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
don't have your name name yet but I
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:28.990 --> 02:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
speak Sean Sean yep Sean pesel um just
 
02:50:30.590 --> 02:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
representing myself I am a resident of
 
02:50:31.630 --> 02:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and also an educator here
 
02:50:33.190 --> 02:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire too um just want to
 
02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
call your attention to from my from what
 
02:50:37.630 --> 02:50:37.640 align:start position:0%
I understand a procedural disconnect um
 
02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
at an earlier meeting that the part one
 
02:50:42.510 --> 02:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
of the 306s were um discussed in public
 
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and public comment was made um
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
there was a a request to hold off on
 
02:50:49.150 --> 02:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
voting on that part um
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
in essence understanding because there
 
02:50:52.389 --> 02:50:52.399 align:start position:0%
was known and made understood that part
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
one and part two should be heard and
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
listened together before making a vote
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
on part one that's where the disconnect
 
02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
comes then here today you did not hear
 
02:51:02.710 --> 02:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
testim new testimony on part one which
 
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
is totally fine your prerogative because
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
you've heard stuff before you heard some
 
02:51:05.910 --> 02:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
procedural stuff from two
 
02:51:07.630 --> 02:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives um but you did take a
 
02:51:09.630 --> 02:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
vote on part one without hearing about
 
02:51:13.389 --> 02:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
part two which is why um it was again to
 
02:51:15.229 --> 02:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
reiterate why you held off on voting for
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
part one last meeting in order to vote
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
on part two today
 
02:51:21.389 --> 02:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
now hearing the testimony for part two
 
02:51:24.030 --> 02:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
um mostly from Christine Dowling she
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
highlighted for you very clearly the
 
02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
connections multiple connections between
 
02:51:31.790 --> 02:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
part one and part two with this stated I
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
ask for a vote of reconsideration that
 
02:51:36.190 --> 02:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
you be be brought forward by prea by a
 
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
prevailing member of the prevailing side
 
02:51:40.349 --> 02:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
meaning a person that voted to approve
 
02:51:43.750 --> 02:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
part one and I ask that you reconsider
 
02:51:46.830 --> 02:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
part one now hearing about part two and
 
02:51:49.469 --> 02:51:49.479 align:start position:0%
vote on both parts one and two today
 
02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:01.110 --> 02:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
please thank you very
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
much my name is Mary Wilkey I'm a um
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
resident of conquered and I am a retired
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
school teacher public school teacher and
 
02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
I have two uh concerns with the proposed
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
rules the first is that they exceed the
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
Department's regulatory Authority and
 
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
should be rejected um these proposed
 
02:52:31.349 --> 02:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
changes uh to the rules represent
 
02:52:33.150 --> 02:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
Monumental changes in the way public
 
02:52:35.469 --> 02:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
education would be provided and go well
 
02:52:37.030 --> 02:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
beyond the statutory authority of the
 
02:52:39.389 --> 02:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh the changes
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
reflect an entirely different vision of
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
public education than what we've had to
 
02:52:45.429 --> 02:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
date a vision in which school districts
 
02:52:47.670 --> 02:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to provide education they
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
have just have to ensure it and where
 
02:52:52.510 --> 02:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
instruction may or may not be offered
 
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
and where class sizes may be determined
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
by the number of people in the room that
 
02:52:59.229 --> 02:52:59.239 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily all um meet the
 
02:53:01.950 --> 02:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
definition of teachers um you could even
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
interpret that section as allowing the
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
ratio to be to depend on the number of
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
qualified uh teachers and parent
 
02:53:10.910 --> 02:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the whole Building
 
02:53:12.349 --> 02:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
compared to the number of students in
 
02:53:15.229 --> 02:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
the whole building um the proposed rules
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
consistently delete words like program
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
and then stuck and and instruction
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
indicating that schools will no longer
 
02:53:23.469 --> 02:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
be required to provide systematic and
 
02:53:26.349 --> 02:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
planned instruction vers via lessons
 
02:53:28.750 --> 02:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
conducted by certified teachers as they
 
02:53:30.349 --> 02:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
have been doing for
 
02:53:32.349 --> 02:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
Generations the fact that the changes in
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules are so dramatic was
 
02:53:36.269 --> 02:53:36.279 align:start position:0%
reflected has been reflected in the
 
02:53:39.790 --> 02:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
outpouring of um of testimony against
 
02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
them more than 200 people as you know
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
have submitted testimony critical of
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
these changes with many worried about
 
02:53:48.630 --> 02:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
significant diminishment of the quality
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
of education and of our Public Schools
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
um it is true that after the public
 
02:53:55.950 --> 02:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
testimony in April the board made some
 
02:53:58.550 --> 02:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
changes in the proposed rules but if you
 
02:54:00.269 --> 02:54:00.279 align:start position:0%
look very carefully at the wording of
 
02:54:02.550 --> 02:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
those changes you'll see that in the end
 
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
the rules still would remove current
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
requirements that schools provide
 
02:54:08.590 --> 02:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
systematic and planned instruction
 
02:54:11.070 --> 02:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
offered by licensed teachers in classes
 
02:54:14.229 --> 02:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
with reasonable size limits when RSA
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
193e was adopted to set forth the
 
02:54:18.910 --> 02:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate education
 
02:54:21.389 --> 02:54:21.399 align:start position:0%
legislators didn't have in mind a public
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
education system that would allow for a
 
02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
smorgus board of optional experiences
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
that M or might not involve teachers
 
02:54:30.510 --> 02:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
might or might not involve classrooms or
 
02:54:32.670 --> 02:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
instruction in fact after setting out a
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
list of the learning areas in in uh
 
02:54:38.550 --> 02:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
193e for instance language arts and math
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
Etc the legislature specifically
 
02:54:42.990 --> 02:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
required that teachers use academic and
 
02:54:45.389 --> 02:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
applied instruction to teach the
 
02:54:48.510 --> 02:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
learning areas the rules deletion of
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
words like instruction and courses and
 
02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
teaching and program um is a policy move
 
02:54:56.110 --> 02:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with that language and with
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of the legislature in short
 
02:55:00.349 --> 02:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
the drafters of these proposed rules are
 
02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
imagining School in a very different way
 
02:55:05.309 --> 02:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
from what currently exists from what is
 
02:55:07.269 --> 02:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
expected by The taxpayers Who pay for
 
02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
them and the parents who send their
 
02:55:10.349 --> 02:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
children to them and from the
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
legislature itself certainly there's
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
room in the public discourse to imagine
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
various aspects or reimagine various
 
02:55:19.630 --> 02:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
aspects of public public education and
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not arguing in favor of maintaining
 
02:55:24.670 --> 02:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
the status quo for the end of time but
 
02:55:26.670 --> 02:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
for an administrative agency to
 
02:55:29.150 --> 02:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
Institute dramatic policy changes of
 
02:55:31.229 --> 02:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
this kind through rulemaking is a
 
02:55:33.710 --> 02:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
significant overreach of its Authority
 
02:55:35.469 --> 02:55:35.479 align:start position:0%
and violates the constitutional
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
principle of separation of
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
powers I also am concerned that the
 
02:55:41.309 --> 02:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
rules are not in the public interest and
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
others have mentioned this I won't
 
02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
duplicate what they've said I have a
 
02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
couple of different aspects I want to
 
02:55:49.349 --> 02:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
mention um the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:55:51.309 --> 02:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
Court has written public education
 
02:55:53.429 --> 02:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
differs from all other services of the
 
02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
state no other governmental service
 
02:55:57.630 --> 02:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
plays such a seminal role in developing
 
02:56:00.710 --> 02:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
and and maintaining a citizen to be
 
02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
capable of furthering the economic
 
02:56:04.269 --> 02:56:04.279 align:start position:0%
political and social viability of the
 
02:56:07.910 --> 02:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
state only in part two article 83 is it
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
declared a duty of the legislature to sh
 
02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
cherish a service mandated by the state
 
02:56:15.950 --> 02:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
constitution given their acknowledged
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
importance to our democracy our
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
communities and our students weakening
 
02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
public schools by watering down the
 
02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
minimum standards is just by simple
 
02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
logic against public interest Common
 
02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
Sense also suggests that if the
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
proposals were in the public interest
 
02:56:35.070 --> 02:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
the public would want them and yet I
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
have yet to hear a single person today
 
02:56:41.349 --> 02:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
last time and at the hearing in um in
 
02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
April at the board ever urg the
 
02:56:47.190 --> 02:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
department to adopt these rules moreover
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
um somebody else has already mentioned
 
02:56:52.229 --> 02:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
the issue of equity and I um the idea
 
02:56:54.229 --> 02:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the proposed rules make so many
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
aspects of Education vague or
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
non-mandatory that we can easily foresee
 
02:57:01.150 --> 02:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
schools in some districts making choices
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't meet our current standards
 
02:57:06.030 --> 02:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
simply because they're less expensive I
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
would just like to add to that that we
 
02:57:09.269 --> 02:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
already have a school system that is
 
02:57:11.150 --> 02:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
funded in a way that creates halves and
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
halves Nots depending on school on zip
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
code lowering the mandatory standards
 
02:57:18.910 --> 02:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
which state what is expected at the very
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
least in every public school will make
 
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
these disparities worse which is of
 
02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
course not in the public interest thank
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
you very much for hearing me thank you
 
02:57:30.309 --> 02:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
for for your
 
02:57:33.110 --> 02:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
testimony chairman Klein do you wish to
 
02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:39.429 --> 02:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
anything I'm GNA Department
 
02:57:46.750 --> 02:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
else he may Chang his mind here shortly
 
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
the skill that I think I might have
 
02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:55.960 align:start position:0%
tried to renew was a high school debate
 
02:57:58.190 --> 02:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
trying to listen to everyone's comments
 
02:58:00.389 --> 02:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
and try to make sure that I can address
 
02:58:02.349 --> 02:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
everything I'm sure I'm not going to
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
address every point that was made um
 
02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
holistically here
 
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to start with the same
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
premise that I started my last remarks
 
02:58:17.070 --> 02:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
which is I'm going to take you all back
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
to why we're here
 
02:58:21.070 --> 02:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
and who your council is and who's made
 
02:58:24.030 --> 02:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations to you
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
and there have been go back through the
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
history the initial proposal was brought
 
02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
forward there were lots of
 
02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
changes recommendations for
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
changes comments from OS regarding that
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
initial proposal that was initially
 
02:58:43.150 --> 02:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
passed by the state
 
02:58:46.590 --> 02:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
board the State Board reviewed those
 
02:58:49.550 --> 02:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
comments with that from o
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
comment made decision making made policy
 
02:58:59.150 --> 02:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
decisions based upon that public comment
 
02:59:01.150 --> 02:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
that was received we're not the State
 
02:59:05.190 --> 02:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
Board is not legally compelled to adopt
 
02:59:07.590 --> 02:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
all public comment considering the fact
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
some of it is contradictory it would
 
02:59:12.229 --> 02:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
actually be impossible to adopt all
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of public comment and put forth a
 
02:59:18.870 --> 02:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
amended proposal that's exactly what the
 
02:59:23.429 --> 02:59:23.439 align:start position:0%
the process is OSS has reviewed that at
 
02:59:26.830 --> 02:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
this point and has no objection and
 
02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
virtually no comment again a couple
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
typos so that should be the first thing
 
02:59:35.750 --> 02:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
you all look to at when you're making a
 
02:59:38.229 --> 02:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
determination is what did your Council
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
say about these rules and whether they
 
02:59:41.950 --> 02:59:41.960 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:59:45.110 --> 02:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
approved overwhelmingly your council's
 
02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
telling you they should be approved
 
02:59:51.349 --> 02:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
there were many many policy related
 
02:59:53.389 --> 02:59:53.399 align:start position:0%
arguments that were brought up during
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing process in the last hour
 
03:00:00.190 --> 03:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
plus um many of them did not relate to
 
03:00:02.590 --> 03:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
the second half at all many of them
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
related back to the first half um if you
 
03:00:09.389 --> 03:00:09.399 align:start position:0%
one there was and I think I have to
 
03:00:11.150 --> 03:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
address this for the sake of my rules
 
03:00:13.150 --> 03:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
administrator who has been accused of
 
03:00:15.790 --> 03:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
lying and misrepresenting the facts and
 
03:00:18.030 --> 03:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
and I think I was too that one of our
 
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
links on our website wasn't working um
 
03:00:23.910 --> 03:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
so we learned today one of the links
 
03:00:26.469 --> 03:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
wasn't working at no point in time it
 
03:00:29.910 --> 03:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
was working when we put it up um our
 
03:00:32.990 --> 03:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
requirement is to comply with 541a which
 
03:00:35.150 --> 03:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that the public has
 
03:00:37.630 --> 03:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
notice and that is that the information
 
03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
is on the Jael car website that is our
 
03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
legal requirement number one we have
 
03:00:45.150 --> 03:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
satisfied our legal requirement there's
 
03:00:46.990 --> 03:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
been no question that we've satisfied
 
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
our legal requirement
 
03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
our ethics have all been challenged
 
03:00:52.389 --> 03:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
because there was a link that wasn't
 
03:00:55.190 --> 03:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
working on our website the more
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
important part of that is no one
 
03:00:59.229 --> 03:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
bothered to point it out apparently
 
03:01:02.229 --> 03:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
everybody behind me decided that the
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
website wasn't working but didn't bother
 
03:01:08.630 --> 03:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
to call miss Shay or me who is in charge
 
03:01:11.550 --> 03:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
objection okay we are attributing a
 
03:01:13.950 --> 03:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
motivation to people who are providing
 
03:01:15.550 --> 03:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I think it's wildly
 
03:01:19.309 --> 03:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate yes you cannot
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
cannot concern yourself with their with
 
03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:25.399 align:start position:0%
their motivation you must simply deal
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
with what they did or said thank you um
 
03:01:31.710 --> 03:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
I am in charge of right to nose as
 
03:01:34.269 --> 03:01:34.279 align:start position:0%
Department counsel I have had no right
 
03:01:37.990 --> 03:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
to nose for any proposals that are in
 
03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
front of this board today um the
 
03:01:43.389 --> 03:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
department I am also receive all
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
inquiries in that come into the doe info
 
03:01:49.469 --> 03:01:49.479 align:start position:0%
um my staff doesn't know and this would
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
have been something that would have come
 
03:01:53.349 --> 03:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
to me or miss Shay I have not received
 
03:01:56.389 --> 03:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
any inquiries that there was um any
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
broken information or not available
 
03:02:01.190 --> 03:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
information but most importantly we've
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
complied with the law and that's 541a
 
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
and that was our that was Our obligation
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh the department had attempted and
 
03:02:10.349 --> 03:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sounds like unsuccessfully
 
03:02:13.349 --> 03:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
to provide an extra layer of information
 
03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
and that is not does not make it illegal
 
03:02:19.630 --> 03:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
um so one of the last comments that was
 
03:02:22.950 --> 03:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
made was um that the rules in front of
 
03:02:24.389 --> 03:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
you are beyond the scope of the
 
03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um well the
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
department of education does not have Ru
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
making Authority these rules are the
 
03:02:33.510 --> 03:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
state board rules that's always very
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
important to notice um the Department of
 
03:02:38.110 --> 03:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
Education is a unique agency and that
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
our agency does not have our
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner does not have the authority
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules our rul making
 
03:02:46.349 --> 03:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
Authority is the state board um that
 
03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
does make us unique
 
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
um there's been um a lot of discussion
 
03:02:58.469 --> 03:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
by um several speakers that um Were
 
03:03:02.950 --> 03:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
Somehow not going to have uh instruction
 
03:03:05.469 --> 03:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
um and I hate to go back to go the first
 
03:03:07.229 --> 03:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
half but I think I have to like go back
 
03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
to the first half rules in order to
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
point to the places where the rules
 
03:03:14.710 --> 03:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
actually require instruction which is
 
03:03:16.990 --> 03:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
the content areas then are tied to the
 
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
back half um 3
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
30618 a says all students have access to
 
03:03:27.030 --> 03:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
full year full day instruction in person
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
as required in RSA 1891 and RSA
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
18924 that's full day full-time
 
03:03:38.229 --> 03:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
instruction the other piece of this goes
 
03:03:41.950 --> 03:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
back to school year which is under
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
30615 each School shall maintain a
 
03:03:46.190 --> 03:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
calendar provides 180 days of
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
instruction are the required number of
 
03:03:50.830 --> 03:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
instructional hours which may be result
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
in fewer than 180 days so it's very
 
03:03:56.510 --> 03:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
clear and then it been be it breaks down
 
03:03:59.110 --> 03:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
to the number of instructional time for
 
03:04:02.229 --> 03:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
kindergarten elementary schools and for
 
03:04:05.469 --> 03:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
grades 7 to 12 there's and if that's
 
03:04:07.630 --> 03:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
tied to the other rule that requires
 
03:04:07.640 --> 03:04:09.269 align:start position:0%
tied to the other rule that requires
in-person

03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
in-person
 
03:04:09.279 --> 03:04:10.910 align:start position:0%
in-person
instruction

03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
03:04:13.309 --> 03:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
um there was a
 
03:04:16.830 --> 03:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
concern uh expressed um by one of the
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
speakers relating to the academic
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
standards setting forth kind of where we
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
want kids at certain benchmarks fourth
 
03:04:27.670 --> 03:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
and eth and 12th grade I would say look
 
03:04:29.990 --> 03:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
no further than to the legislative
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
language in 193
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
e2a Roman numeral 2 which set force that
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
standards shall cover kindergarten
 
03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
through 12th grade in cudly F forth the
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities to acquire communication
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
analytical research skills substance of
 
03:04:45.190 --> 03:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge expected to be possessed by
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
students at various grade levels
 
03:04:49.910 --> 03:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
including the credit requirement
 
03:04:51.950 --> 03:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
necessary to earn a high school diploma
 
03:04:54.870 --> 03:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
so this the legislature has said the
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
academic standards are supposed to be
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
pegged to certain grade levels which is
 
03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
what we've done legislature hasn't said
 
03:05:04.309 --> 03:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
that the academic standards have to
 
03:05:07.670 --> 03:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
provide a criteria for attainment for
 
03:05:10.429 --> 03:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
each grade through K through
 
03:05:10.439 --> 03:05:15.349 align:start position:0%
each grade through K through
12

03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
um there uh
 
03:05:21.630 --> 03:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
there was a statement that the academic
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
standards were optional and that we
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
don't have programs I think if you look
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
carefully at the the the back half if
 
03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
you go through each content area um the
 
03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
con the each start with the same
 
03:05:36.510 --> 03:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
language that the local school board
 
03:05:38.710 --> 03:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
shall ensure a development appropriate
 
03:05:40.150 --> 03:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
and fill in the blank for what the
 
03:05:43.429 --> 03:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
content area program for each School
 
03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with the local competencies
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
again you have to go back and look at
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
the definition of program and the rules
 
03:05:59.070 --> 03:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
22 which defines program as a grouping
 
03:06:04.349 --> 03:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
of interrelated activities opportunities
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
and resources designed to implement a
 
03:06:09.550 --> 03:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
particular goal there's no question that
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
there's program education instructional
 
03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
time and that's been done and we've I
 
03:06:16.269 --> 03:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
think we've beat the dead horse of in
 
03:06:19.150 --> 03:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
front of that the has to be a
 
03:06:22.309 --> 03:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
credentialed educator a credential that
 
03:06:25.870 --> 03:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
is granted by the State Board of
 
03:06:29.550 --> 03:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
Education instructing the students under
 
03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
these rules um I'm sure I've missed
 
03:06:38.550 --> 03:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
something um oh a couple of things
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
regarding um I think the concern about
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh digital literacy if you go look to
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:06:50.670 --> 03:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
front half again unfortunately the
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements currently
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
require half a credit of digital
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
literacy they have for the last 10 plus
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
years they've already this is this is
 
03:07:02.550 --> 03:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
the complaint is actually about
 
03:07:05.229 --> 03:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
something that's been incurrent uh
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
law the entire time and if there's any
 
03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
concern about lack of academic standards
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
for um rhetoric at this point those
 
03:07:17.150 --> 03:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
rules don't go into effect for kids
 
03:07:19.229 --> 03:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
until they enter School two years from
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
now so I mean it's going to take some
 
03:07:23.469 --> 03:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
time to get those academic standards
 
03:07:25.150 --> 03:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
done but I'm hopeful that the department
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
will and the state board will be able to
 
03:07:30.790 --> 03:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
approve those in line with the um time
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
frame set forth in those rules but if
 
03:07:35.229 --> 03:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
you if you look at these we're really
 
03:07:38.750 --> 03:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
making very minimal changes and I it's
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that it seems like we
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
can't read through the the rules in the
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
front half to allow our our education of
 
03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
how the back half is supposed to to to
 
03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
work um and you're getting a little bit
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
blind I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:07:55.950 --> 03:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
in case I miss somebody's point from
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
earlier that you all um need to have
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
discussed I have one
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
question in Miss downing's report there
 
03:08:08.030 --> 03:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
is a page that shows an increase in
 
03:08:10.389 --> 03:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
credits required for graduation in the
 
03:08:13.630 --> 03:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
area of social studies is that due to
 
03:08:16.550 --> 03:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
the rule or is it due to additions in
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
the statute there were changes in the
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
statute that um required additional um
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements in the in the
 
03:08:26.590 --> 03:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
area of
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
civics thank
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
you representative hacken Phillips thank
 
03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just a quick question
 
03:08:36.150 --> 03:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
has the State Board of Education met
 
03:08:38.389 --> 03:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
since the last legislative oversight
 
03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
committee meeting and vote on October
 
03:08:43.790 --> 03:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
29th yes there was a meeting of the
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
State Board last Thursday and did they
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
take up the
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:00.950 --> 03:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
again hi sorry um Julie Shay um they do
 
03:09:02.790 --> 03:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
not have to vote on those yet because
 
03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
the department makes the amended
 
03:09:07.389 --> 03:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request um they
 
03:09:09.469 --> 03:09:09.479 align:start position:0%
will be looking at that at the December
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and creating a response and then
 
03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
sending it to the jail
 
03:09:15.870 --> 03:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
car and in the way in the way your rules
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
work our conditional approve approval
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
was due on October 30 not 31st I think
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:09:23.880 --> 03:09:25.550 align:start position:0%
it was
October

03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
October
 
03:09:29.950 --> 03:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
November so they were due uh couple of
 
03:09:33.670 --> 03:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
weeks before the State Board had had a
 
03:09:36.389 --> 03:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
meeting so in order for us to be at this
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
meeting we had to get everything
 
03:09:41.550 --> 03:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
together before the state board
 
03:09:43.590 --> 03:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
meeting director Mor I'll let attorney
 
03:09:46.070 --> 03:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
munes explain that director moral if you
 
03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
could explain that please clarify uh
 
03:09:51.870 --> 03:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals are a two-stage
 
03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
process because the rulemaker is rarely
 
03:09:57.070 --> 03:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
here to request that conditional
 
03:10:00.269 --> 03:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
approval it's made by their staff that
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
means the conditional approval goes back
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
to the agency has to be the language
 
03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
that was offered by their staff is
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed and given approval by
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
commission or board or department head
 
03:10:22.670 --> 03:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.510 --> 03:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
office okay
 
03:10:27.229 --> 03:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
so and yes their their conditional
 
03:10:29.670 --> 03:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
approval um
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
deadline was after the deadline for this
 
03:10:36.110 --> 03:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
gel car meeting so they had to get it in
 
03:10:37.710 --> 03:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
before the deadline for the Jael car
 
03:10:43.150 --> 03:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
meeting representative G yes I would
 
03:10:48.750 --> 03:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
like to could you point out to the the
 
03:10:51.590 --> 03:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
financial note on the second half what
 
03:10:54.070 --> 03:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
page is that on I believe it's on page
 
03:10:57.630 --> 03:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
seven of your final proposal packet it's
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
within the not the original notice that
 
03:11:03.630 --> 03:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
was filed with our office with the
 
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
initial proposal so the fiscal impact
 
03:11:09.150 --> 03:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
statement comes from the legislative
 
03:11:09.160 --> 03:11:10.469 align:start position:0%
statement comes from the legislative
budget

03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:11:14.429 --> 03:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
assistant and um we include the notice
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
in all of our final proposal packets and
 
03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
it starts I'm sorry it starts on page
 
03:11:27.269 --> 03:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
four of um the FP packet for
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
202442 and you can see number 10 says
 
03:11:31.710 --> 03:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement and it has a
 
03:11:33.469 --> 03:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact number and then the fiscal
 
03:11:35.229 --> 03:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
impact from the
 
03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
LBA and keep in mind that this analysis
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
for the LBA is between the proposed rule
 
03:11:44.910 --> 03:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
rule right
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Greg I'm looking for and I have
 
03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
a question another question I'd like to
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh know what legislation was passed that
 
03:12:00.070 --> 03:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
requires Civics what what I don't have a
 
03:12:03.269 --> 03:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
recollection of that
 
03:12:19.870 --> 03:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:22.030 --> 03:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
and I I can't find that fiscal note on
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
page seven I'm
 
03:12:36.349 --> 03:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:42.990 --> 03:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
off

03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
18911 instruction in National andate
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
Civics

03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.349 --> 03:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
Jack yes there's a list in 1A requiring
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated class time for civics in
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
elementary halfe course of the
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
equivalent in Civics in Middle School
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
halfe course in Civics in high school a
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
one-year course in history government
 
03:13:32.590 --> 03:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
constitutions in new United States and
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in high school required
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
for high school graduation and that
 
03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.510 align:start position:0%
for high school graduation and that
effective

03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
date

03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
date
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes representative Lon September
 
03:13:47.710 --> 03:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.750 --> 03:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
that is the most recent change in that
 
03:13:52.110 --> 03:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
statute but I'm not sure it pertains to
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
that yeah if if I may I think there
 
03:13:56.110 --> 03:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
might be some confusion here I I might
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
be able to help um so so if you look at
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
that uh High School graduation
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
requirements the list there's 20 credits
 
03:14:07.269 --> 03:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
is what we had before and we remain with
 
03:14:10.750 --> 03:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
20 credits we made some
 
03:14:13.910 --> 03:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
changes but you'll notice that at the
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
top it we changed the language from
 
03:14:19.630 --> 03:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
required course of study and credits to
 
03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:20.950 align:start position:0%
required course of study and credits to
requir

03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
requir
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
credits for high school
 
03:14:26.870 --> 03:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
graduation so you still have 20 credits
 
03:14:28.750 --> 03:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
just like you did before but we
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
rearrange the
 
03:14:33.710 --> 03:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
credits so I don't have all the history
 
03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the changes here so I don't know that
 
03:14:36.510 --> 03:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
I could get you every single thing that
 
03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
we changed um and there were some
 
03:14:41.510 --> 03:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
changes that were made at state board
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
meetings based upon your working group
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
as well and this is where I corre I yeah
 
03:14:50.190 --> 03:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
we proposed some changes and then we got
 
03:14:52.110 --> 03:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
feedback on them and altered them we
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
were going
 
03:14:55.229 --> 03:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
to uh reduce the number of open
 
03:14:56.830 --> 03:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
electives further than we actually end
 
03:14:59.429 --> 03:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
up doing um and that was on feedback
 
03:15:03.790 --> 03:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
from uh CTE instructors but we added
 
03:15:06.269 --> 03:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
um so for example we Chang the
 
03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
mathematics credits to add a half Credit
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
in statistics and data analysis right
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
and reduce it from four required credits
 
03:15:16.030 --> 03:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
to um three or three and a half do we
 
03:15:21.070 --> 03:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:24.429 --> 03:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
um we made an adjustment to the history
 
03:15:27.469 --> 03:15:27.479 align:start position:0%
the way the the history credits are are
 
03:15:27.479 --> 03:15:30.150 align:start position:0%
the way the the history credits are are
required

03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
um and logic and rhetoric but it's
 
03:15:35.550 --> 03:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
important to note that those are
 
03:15:37.990 --> 03:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
credits and to get to one of the points
 
03:15:39.229 --> 03:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
that was made
 
03:15:42.150 --> 03:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
before um this is not a requirement to
 
03:15:44.189 --> 03:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
offer a standalone logic and rhetoric
 
03:15:46.189 --> 03:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
class this is consistent with the
 
03:15:46.199 --> 03:15:48.189 align:start position:0%
class this is consistent with the
statutory

03:15:48.189 --> 03:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
um authority to require because the
 
03:15:52.590 --> 03:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
statute requires that the kids get
 
03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
credits in in logic and rhetoric we put
 
03:15:57.710 --> 03:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
that into the High School requirements
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
not for a standalone course but for
 
03:16:01.389 --> 03:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
credits just to reemphasize that
 
03:16:01.399 --> 03:16:02.630 align:start position:0%
credits just to reemphasize that
legislative

03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:16:04.590 --> 03:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
requirement so I don't know if that
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
helps at all but um Madam chair uh Dr
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
Downing I think has a perspective on
 
03:16:12.990 --> 03:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.469 --> 03:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
you because I'm not clear it's very
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
unclear before we to another person in
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
the audience you did recognize me and
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives had a a a
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
follow on question so I would like to be
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you we're trying to
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
answer this this question but but
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
Senator gray please I moved to approve I
 
03:16:35.150 --> 03:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
have not heard anything in this
 
03:16:38.349 --> 03:16:38.359 align:start position:0%
testimony that has changed my opinion uh
 
03:16:40.510 --> 03:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
from what I had when I walked into the
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
room so thank you all right thank you we
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.790 --> 03:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
if someone it has been seconded by
 
03:16:51.800 --> 03:16:53.830 align:start position:0%
if someone it has been seconded by
representative

03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
Lynn uh is there someone who can answer
 
03:16:59.950 --> 03:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
the question about these these credits
 
03:17:01.990 --> 03:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
to our yes thank you Miss Downing that
 
03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:09.750 align:start position:0%
to our yes thank you Miss Downing that
would

03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
help if you actually go to my report
 
03:17:15.830 --> 03:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
page 29 you'll see a direct
 
03:17:19.670 --> 03:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
comp look it again I am going to have to
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with attorney
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
Brown over here that the credit
 
03:17:26.030 --> 03:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
requirements were a result of of changes
 
03:17:28.269 --> 03:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
in the legislation and if you look at my
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
chart on page 29 I'll carefully explain
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
that to you so us and New Hampshire
 
03:17:35.070 --> 03:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
history has always been offered in our
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
high schools as one credit what the
 
03:17:39.189 --> 03:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
board did was separate that now out
 
03:17:41.429 --> 03:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
specifically to be US history is a half
 
03:17:43.550 --> 03:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
credit separate New Hampshire history is
 
03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
a h half credit that was a net change of
 
03:17:48.269 --> 03:17:48.279 align:start position:0%
zero United States and New Hampshire
 
03:17:50.469 --> 03:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
government and Civics has always been
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
offered there is nothing in the RSA in
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
193e that changed to cause these credit
 
03:18:00.070 --> 03:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
requirement changes so they decided to
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
separate out Civics but I want to point
 
03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
out that in paragraph 1 of 193 e2a which
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
defines the areas for an adequate
 
03:18:12.070 --> 03:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
education Civics has always been listed
 
03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
next to social studies in the
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
parenthesis Civic has been and continues
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
to be happening in our high schools and
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
then they separated out the history
 
03:18:23.189 --> 03:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
government and Constitution of us and
 
03:18:25.870 --> 03:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to one credit again I'm
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to tell you from a high school
 
03:18:29.110 --> 03:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
perspective in our Us in New Hampshire
 
03:18:31.469 --> 03:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
government classes the study of the
 
03:18:33.870 --> 03:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution has always been there there
 
03:18:37.309 --> 03:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
has not been a legislative an RSA change
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
to need that in economics and this is
 
03:18:42.429 --> 03:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
where I'm going to counteract the
 
03:18:44.469 --> 03:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
argument from Cher Klein where he
 
03:18:46.110 --> 03:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
continues to say well they can do it
 
03:18:48.349 --> 03:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
integr cuz I brought this up at the
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
State Board of Ed economics has always
 
03:18:53.030 --> 03:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
been a graduation requirement and when
 
03:18:56.030 --> 03:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
the first bill passed that required the
 
03:18:58.670 --> 03:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the the direct instruction of
 
03:19:02.189 --> 03:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy that Bill said
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
it may be integrated so therefore many
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
high schools integrated personal finance
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
literacy into economics but you can see
 
03:19:14.349 --> 03:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
what the board has now done is made
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy its own
 
03:19:20.269 --> 03:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
separate half Credit Now that sends a
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
signal to the field that they can no
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
longer be integrated because prior we
 
03:19:28.150 --> 03:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
could the world history Global Studies
 
03:19:30.790 --> 03:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
or geography has always been there that
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
is not a legislative change but yet they
 
03:19:36.670 --> 03:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
have now opt it to a full credit with no
 
03:19:39.269 --> 03:19:39.279 align:start position:0%
no Clarity to the field about why are we
 
03:19:41.309 --> 03:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
increasing this to a full credit if
 
03:19:43.150 --> 03:19:43.160 align:start position:0%
we've already got it in there and then
 
03:19:45.830 --> 03:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
logic and rhetoric for years well I
 
03:19:48.269 --> 03:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say years last few years logic
 
03:19:51.630 --> 03:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
and rhetoric has been part of Part B of
 
03:19:51.640 --> 03:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
and rhetoric has been part of Part B of
193

03:19:53.110 --> 03:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
193
 
03:19:57.630 --> 03:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
e2a and it the RSA clearly says there
 
03:20:00.429 --> 03:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
that it will be integrated in the above
 
03:20:03.830 --> 03:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
academic areas of paragraph one but yet
 
03:20:06.990 --> 03:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
now we've imposed a half credit I have
 
03:20:10.030 --> 03:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
to refute the public claim that was made
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
here this today that these credit
 
03:20:16.189 --> 03:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
changes were due to RSA changes that is
 
03:20:18.910 --> 03:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
not correct and I do want to speak
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
question Mr Downey not a not an
 
03:20:24.790 --> 03:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
accusation the question was is that due
 
03:20:27.870 --> 03:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
to legislative changes no it's not thank
 
03:20:32.189 --> 03:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.199 --> 03:20:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:36.990 --> 03:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
okay I would like to speak to the motion
 
03:20:38.550 --> 03:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
well I I'll let the I'll let the person
 
03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
who made the motion speak to his motion
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
Senator gray have you you spoke to the
 
03:20:43.910 --> 03:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
motion do you wish just continue pretty
 
03:20:46.950 --> 03:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
much I've said all I want except that
 
03:20:49.710 --> 03:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
that you know I believe that the process
 
03:20:52.269 --> 03:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
has been followed and tried to be
 
03:20:55.469 --> 03:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
followed correctly and that I am ready
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
to vote on this issue all right thank
 
03:21:00.309 --> 03:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
you Senator Whitley thank you madam
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
chair um I think you know what's at
 
03:21:06.389 --> 03:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
stake here which has been made very
 
03:21:08.110 --> 03:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
clear is that we're talking about the
 
03:21:09.910 --> 03:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
quality of our public education in New
 
03:21:11.950 --> 03:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's what's at stake
 
03:21:14.030 --> 03:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
here you know I'm a mom I have a fifth
 
03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
grader I have a deep deep interest in
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
making Mak sure that my son's education
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
is as high quality as possible of course
 
03:21:22.110 --> 03:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
for every child in my district in the
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
state that's what's at stake here the
 
03:21:26.269 --> 03:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
quality of our public education should
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
not be a partisan issue it shouldn't
 
03:21:29.790 --> 03:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
which is why it was it was pretty
 
03:21:31.349 --> 03:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that first vote was a
 
03:21:33.630 --> 03:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
partisan vote because it shouldn't be
 
03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
the quality of our public education has
 
03:21:39.229 --> 03:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with politics it is the
 
03:21:42.389 --> 03:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
foundation of our democracy it's a
 
03:21:44.750 --> 03:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement in the state
 
03:21:47.070 --> 03:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire there has been
 
03:21:50.590 --> 03:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
countless litigation defining what is a
 
03:21:52.910 --> 03:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education that's what's at
 
03:21:55.469 --> 03:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
stake here this should not be about
 
03:21:58.750 --> 03:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
politics yet we seem to be going in a
 
03:22:01.309 --> 03:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
direction we where we are
 
03:22:04.910 --> 03:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
ignoring the vast majority of our
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
Educators our administrators our parents
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
all whom have major major concerns with
 
03:22:15.229 --> 03:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
these rules and I deeply respect our
 
03:22:19.229 --> 03:22:19.239 align:start position:0%
attorneys was uh that serve the J car I
 
03:22:21.670 --> 03:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
deeply respect them and also it is Our
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
obligation as elected officials to
 
03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
determine and make an analysis about the
 
03:22:29.510 --> 03:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
public interest and that's what we were
 
03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:31.189 align:start position:0%
public interest and that's what we were
doing

03:22:31.189 --> 03:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:22:35.189 --> 03:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
here so I I want to clearly State for
 
03:22:38.510 --> 03:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
the record that based on the volume of
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
testimony we have received both today
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
and over the course of almost many years
 
03:22:47.189 --> 03:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
now that there are four bases for an
 
03:22:49.469 --> 03:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
objection and that is that those are
 
03:22:51.309 --> 03:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
more bases than I have ever seen as a
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
member of Ja car as both a member for
 
03:22:56.429 --> 03:22:56.439 align:start position:0%
the past four years an attorney who's to
 
03:22:58.189 --> 03:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
practice in front of Jael car I have
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
never seen such a substantial solid
 
03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
basis for objection of any rules I
 
03:23:08.110 --> 03:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
haven't and there are four I'm look I'm
 
03:23:11.070 --> 03:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
specifically um referencing our Jal car
 
03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
rules one the these rules should be
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
objected to we should all be voting
 
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
against the approval because these rules
 
03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
clearly go beyond agency Authority
 
03:23:22.030 --> 03:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
that's under part
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
401 another basis for objection part 402
 
03:23:28.110 --> 03:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
these rules are clearly con uh contrary
 
03:23:31.550 --> 03:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
to legislative intent that's part 402
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
part 403 these rules are clearly
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
contrary to the public interest and in
 
03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
my opinion this is the strongest basis
 
03:23:41.950 --> 03:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
for an objection and then four part 404
 
03:23:44.269 --> 03:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
there's there is a substantial impact
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on these rules it's on
 
03:23:49.189 --> 03:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's undeniable and it has not been
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
recognized in the fiscal impact
 
03:23:52.750 --> 03:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
statement we have not fully explored
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
this I feel like this is a dereliction
 
03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
of our duty to our uh uh constituents
 
03:24:01.510 --> 03:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
without sufficiently exploring this so
 
03:24:03.269 --> 03:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
there so based on that I will be voting
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
against the approval and I really
 
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
encourage all of us to take a step back
 
03:24:09.469 --> 03:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
to take a beat to not make this a
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
political vote send a message to the
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
state and to uh our constituents that
 
03:24:16.830 --> 03:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
public education is not a political
 
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
issue to take a step back and listen to
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
our Educators listen to our parents
 
03:24:24.630 --> 03:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
listen to our administrators and vote
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
against this approval and move towards
 
03:24:28.110 --> 03:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
an objection so we can get this right
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
Thank you madam chair thank you any
 
03:24:32.349 --> 03:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
other comments representative hacken
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
Phillips thank you madam chair um so yes
 
03:24:39.150 --> 03:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
I agree with Senator Whitley's um
 
03:24:42.269 --> 03:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
remarks I just wanted to make two notes
 
03:24:47.950 --> 03:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.229 --> 03:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
there was there was a passing thought
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
earlier today and testimony that the
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
public and the
 
03:24:56.910 --> 03:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislature um would need to submit a
 
03:24:58.870 --> 03:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
right to no request in order to get
 
03:25:00.510 --> 03:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
timely and accurate information about
 
03:25:02.910 --> 03:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
the rul making process um that we have
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
we are reviewing today uh and the
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
absence of that was suggested as that
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
there wasn't really a need for it so I
 
03:25:12.790 --> 03:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
would just like to check mark that as
 
03:25:16.429 --> 03:25:16.439 align:start position:0%
being um concerning that the legislature
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
or the public would need to file
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
official right to no request in order to
 
03:25:22.990 --> 03:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
receive the information in a timely
 
03:25:26.030 --> 03:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
basis that we're reviewing today
 
03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
second is that this there's this
 
03:25:30.750 --> 03:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
insistence that there's no confusion
 
03:25:33.150 --> 03:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
because of you know the new front half
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the rules that we just approved
 
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
clearly connect and explain the back
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
half of the rules and uh you know you
 
03:25:41.630 --> 03:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
can find the clarification of the front
 
03:25:43.950 --> 03:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
half by looking at the back half and
 
03:25:45.469 --> 03:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
vice versa and I think that's just a
 
03:25:46.830 --> 03:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
very spur
 
03:25:48.590 --> 03:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
position given the testimony we've heard
 
03:25:50.910 --> 03:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
over and over again that it's not clear
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
that there are vague terms and that um
 
03:25:55.469 --> 03:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
the rules the front half and back half
 
03:25:58.830 --> 03:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
are not clearly defined and do not give
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
districts clear um marching orders so I
 
03:26:06.910 --> 03:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
think um again this is concerning um i'
 
03:26:09.309 --> 03:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
just like to pause and go back to the
 
03:26:11.710 --> 03:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
RSA 139
 
03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:13.429 align:start position:0%
RSA 139
e2a

03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
e2a
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
concerns um it seems to me that the
 
03:26:19.950 --> 03:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
State Board shall not according to RSA
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
193 e2a Roman numeral 4C the State Board
 
03:26:25.910 --> 03:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
shall not recommend any existing
 
03:26:28.670 --> 03:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
academic standards and shall not approve
 
03:26:30.990 --> 03:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
any new academic standards without prior
 
03:26:32.469 --> 03:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
review and recommendation of the
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
03:26:38.750 --> 03:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 193 ca2 and um that
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
did go in effect August of 2023 so uh
 
03:26:45.630 --> 03:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
while I do thank the commissioner uh the
 
03:26:47.110 --> 03:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
director for for providing the
 
03:26:48.790 --> 03:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
explanation of how conditional approvals
 
03:26:51.349 --> 03:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
work I think the procedural safeguards
 
03:26:53.950 --> 03:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
in law under this Clause require
 
03:26:57.150 --> 03:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
specific processes in sequential order
 
03:26:59.550 --> 03:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
to be undertaken with for due process
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
and fair notice through our public
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
meetings to be upheld so what we see
 
03:27:07.189 --> 03:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
from the timeline leading up to today is
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
that the department has failed to First
 
03:27:11.309 --> 03:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
participate in meaningful public
 
03:27:13.950 --> 03:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
hearings second provide evidence of
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
incorporating the committee's feedback
 
03:27:18.990 --> 03:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
when there were closed door meetings by
 
03:27:20.710 --> 03:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
some members of the committee but not
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
all and there being no public meeting uh
 
03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
or an opportunity for the other members
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the legislative oversight committee
 
03:27:29.590 --> 03:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
to ask their questions of the
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
department three uh there was no
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
provision of appropriate materials or
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
documents for review by the members of
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
the committee or the public during those
 
03:27:40.550 --> 03:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
public meetings by the committee and
 
03:27:43.229 --> 03:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
four uh there i' just like to clarify
 
03:27:44.790 --> 03:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's General confusion over what the
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
actual language of the proposed rules or
 
03:27:48.630 --> 03:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
changes to the rules for that definition
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
of educator were under consideration at
 
03:27:54.070 --> 03:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
the time of the committee's vote so um
 
03:27:56.590 --> 03:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
that committee did review and recommend
 
03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
um this like very vague statement uh for
 
03:28:02.830 --> 03:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
their conditional approval but again
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
that was out of order and in defiance of
 
03:28:06.670 --> 03:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
legislative intent there remains
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
important questions whether the state
 
03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
board has subsequently approved the
 
03:28:12.030 --> 03:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
committee's final recommendation and
 
03:28:14.630 --> 03:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
from what I understand they have not and
 
03:28:17.990 --> 03:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
further question is whether
 
03:28:19.710 --> 03:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
the committee's final recommendation can
 
03:28:21.750 --> 03:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
be valued when the proposed rules were
 
03:28:24.269 --> 03:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
never put into writing before the
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
committee's final recommendation vote
 
03:28:28.030 --> 03:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
for the final question is whether the
 
03:28:29.950 --> 03:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
department of education's rul making
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
process for the proposed 306 rules
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
effectively bypass the meeting's
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
meaningful participation of the
 
03:28:38.030 --> 03:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee and
 
03:28:40.349 --> 03:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
furthermore their feedback so for on
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
that basis alone Madam chair um I cannot
 
03:28:46.590 --> 03:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
vote affirmatively I'm not voting today
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
but if I were voting I wouldn't be able
 
03:28:51.590 --> 03:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
to support the motion thank you thank
 
03:28:54.510 --> 03:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
you anyone else CH I request a roll
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
call certainly that makes
 
03:29:01.950 --> 03:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
sense represen Vera yes um these are the
 
03:29:03.229 --> 03:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
things that
 
03:29:05.790 --> 03:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
are concerning to
 
03:29:09.870 --> 03:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
me in that there's no fiscal impact to
 
03:29:09.880 --> 03:29:10.910 align:start position:0%
me in that there's no fiscal impact to
these

03:29:10.910 --> 03:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:29:13.469 --> 03:29:13.479 align:start position:0%
rules yet I don't know how that analysis
 
03:29:15.630 --> 03:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
was done and it's something that I'm
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to dig further into because to me
 
03:29:19.150 --> 03:29:19.160 align:start position:0%
when we have a school board member
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
saying that there is going to be a
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact that seems odd to me cuz I
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
would think that a school district now
 
03:29:28.670 --> 03:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
maybe they are out of
 
03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:30.269 align:start position:0%
maybe they are out of
the

03:29:30.269 --> 03:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:34.429 --> 03:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
calculation of a of a fiscal note but
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's important and the school
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
districts are going to get an impact
 
03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:41.160 align:start position:0%
that's a downshifting of cost to the
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
districts and I don't know if that's
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
going to happen and I think it's
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
important to know that which is why I'm
 
03:29:48.590 --> 03:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
going to be voting
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
against um this motion furthermore um I
 
03:29:55.110 --> 03:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
think that if this occurs it is an
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
erosion of trust because the trust the
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire trust us
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
to do what's best for them and I do not
 
03:30:07.229 --> 03:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
think we're doing that
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
today thank you Senator
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
gray um there was a discussion of
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
parship in this thing we've got the the
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
Education nonpartisan we've got our own
 
03:30:24.670 --> 03:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:27.990 --> 03:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I don't understand why
 
03:30:31.590 --> 03:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
someone would think that our
 
03:30:36.510 --> 03:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
vote is based on input from people who
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
are partisan because we've taken the
 
03:30:42.030 --> 03:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
input from the Board of Education we've
 
03:30:44.950 --> 03:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
taken the input from the Department of
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
Education we've taking the input from
 
03:30:50.469 --> 03:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
the staff my vote was not partisan it
 
03:30:52.910 --> 03:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
was based on those recommendations of
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
the people that we
 
03:30:58.750 --> 03:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
entrust with that
 
03:31:07.229 --> 03:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%

03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
people don't I just want to point
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%

Os attorneys today by the Senators on
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle uh one thing I
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
do want to make clear and this was
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
brought up at the beginning of the
 
03:31:33.389 --> 03:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
meeting is that ol staff received Miss
 
03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
downing's written testimony this morning
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
and we have not done a comprehensive
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
legal analysis of it so we have reviewed
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
everything that came prior to this but
 
03:31:44.269 --> 03:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
we have not looked at this and I just
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the Comm is aware
 
03:31:49.030 --> 03:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
of that before they make any decisions
 
03:31:49.040 --> 03:31:52.590 align:start position:0%
of that before they make any decisions
thank

03:31:52.590 --> 03:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
you m me also on uh regarding the fiscal
 
03:32:00.790 --> 03:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
impact statements that is um the purview
 
03:32:03.790 --> 03:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
of the LBA um
 
03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
should should the the intent of the
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to be to um beef up those
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statements or make them
 
03:32:14.389 --> 03:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
different or make the review different
 
03:32:16.030 --> 03:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
our office would be happy to work with
 
03:32:18.990 --> 03:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
the LBA because those phal impact
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
statements do come to us and we do
 
03:32:22.830 --> 03:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
review them and we do sometimes send
 
03:32:25.750 --> 03:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
them back to the LBA for Corrections um
 
03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
but that process is the LBA process we
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
are happy to help with that yes yes by
 
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
no means did my comment have any
 
03:32:37.710 --> 03:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
reflection on your office it is I just
 
03:32:39.870 --> 03:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
want to understand it from myself and I
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
will go speak with them directly and if
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
something should come up I will be glad
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
to let you know yes and I will mention
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
that I'm confused why people are worried
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal impact when the same
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
people were testifying that these rules
 
03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
would weaken the requirements
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
which I don't understand why that would
 
03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't decrease the cost so uh I which
 
03:33:10.269 --> 03:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
most people are much less worried about
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
than cost
 
03:33:13.790 --> 03:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
increases all right thank you
 
03:33:15.469 --> 03:33:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you wish to say
 
03:33:19.070 --> 03:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
something I wish to say that the point
 
03:33:21.269 --> 03:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be understood by everybody
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
listening that is who is going to pay
 
03:33:24.399 --> 03:33:26.790 align:start position:0%
listening that is who is going to pay
the

03:33:26.790 --> 03:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:31.750 --> 03:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
costs constitutions was States and was
 
03:33:35.229 --> 03:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out as a basis of the clera
 
03:33:37.910 --> 03:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
decision the interpretation was that the
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
word cherish meant fiscal responsibility
 
03:33:45.070 --> 03:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
of the state to provide an ad adequate
 
03:33:45.080 --> 03:33:46.429 align:start position:0%
of the state to provide an ad adequate
education

03:33:46.429 --> 03:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that these rules
 
03:33:51.870 --> 03:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
possibly will push
 
03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
costs off on to property taxpayers that
 
03:33:59.189 --> 03:33:59.199 align:start position:0%

03:35:05.630 --> 03:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
comments substantive comments by our
 
03:35:08.670 --> 03:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
staff which is absolutely true but she
 
03:35:13.189 --> 03:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
equated that with uh staff suggesting
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
approval to the committee that is C not
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%

03:35:21.150 --> 03:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
whether rule should be objected to or
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%

1100 um there are a ton of editorial
 
03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
comments but I won't spend any time on
 
03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
those all of those can be addressed at
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
adoption um the main reason why this
 
03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
proposal is not on the consent agenda is
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
because the enim rules just expired on
 
03:36:20.520 --> 03:36:21.910 align:start position:0%
because the enim rules just expired on
October

03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
October
 
03:36:25.630 --> 03:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
27th and um there are two fees that are
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
included in the rule there is one fee
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
that is set by the rule itself there is
 
03:36:36.269 --> 03:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
another fee that is set in statute so
 
03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
the uh one that's set in statute is in
 
03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:39.630 align:start position:0%
the uh one that's set in statute is in
RSA

03:36:39.630 --> 03:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:36:43.950 --> 03:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
4314 and that's the $75 registration fee
 
03:36:46.790 --> 03:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
but the other fee is set by by the rule
 
03:36:49.189 --> 03:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that on page 13 of your
 
03:36:52.110 --> 03:36:52.120 align:start position:0%
packet and that's an agriculture
 
03:36:55.710 --> 03:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
1106 that fee is an inspection fee of 20
 
03:36:58.790 --> 03:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
cents a ton with a minimum of
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
$5 and uh like I said the rules expired
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
the interim rules just expired on
 
03:37:05.910 --> 03:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
October 27th so you may have some
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions for the agency of whether or
 
03:37:09.389 --> 03:37:09.399 align:start position:0%
not they've collected that fee that's
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
set in the rule and not in the statute
 
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
no turn push till the red light comes
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%

03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
microphones sure I'm sorry close you
 
03:37:33.070 --> 03:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
have speak into not sorry I was hearing
 
03:37:35.790 --> 03:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of reverberation before so was
 
03:37:37.710 --> 03:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
he's got aot trying to spare everyone's
 
03:37:37.720 --> 03:37:39.590 align:start position:0%
he's got aot trying to spare everyone's
ears

03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
ears
 
03:37:42.150 --> 03:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
um Patricia Benner legislative
 
03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the Department of
 
03:37:47.710 --> 03:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food um and I
 
03:37:49.150 --> 03:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
would assume that to answer that
 
03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
question um there has been a lapse the
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
original rule um that expired on 20 uh
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
1027 was an interim Rule and so
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
therefore um because even though it was
 
03:38:04.389 --> 03:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
in the process
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
um they expired um so we're you know
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of weeks lag
 
03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there was um an early
 
03:38:15.550 --> 03:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
payment of $15 that was uh went through
 
03:38:18.189 --> 03:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
through however
 
03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
um that was the only one that that um in
 
03:38:26.830 --> 03:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.030 --> 03:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
yes good than anyone have any comments
 
03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:37.349 align:start position:0%
yes good than anyone have any comments
questions

03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:40.229 --> 03:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
motions Senator gray moves to approve
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:48.309 align:start position:0%
 
any

03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.389 --> 03:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
discussion all
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:00.389 --> 03:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
opposed I'm glad you've approved it
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:06.110 --> 03:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
frame all
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
right um HHS has two interim
 
03:39:14.910 --> 03:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
rules uh yes um interim rule 11 and 12
 
03:39:17.349 --> 03:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
um the first has to do with the
 
03:39:19.910 --> 03:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
distribution and dispersement of support
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.750 --> 03:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
there may be a question about how the
 
03:39:49.229 --> 03:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
agency has been
 
03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing uh the distribution and
 
03:39:54.750 --> 03:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
dispersement of support payments without
 
03:39:57.670 --> 03:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
rules there are some federal regulations
 
03:40:00.189 --> 03:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
regarding this topic however the rules
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
are much more specific than the Federal
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
Regulations so it's hard to um rely
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
solely on those Federal
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
Regulations yes thank
 
03:40:14.670 --> 03:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Alison radme the

03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
Services good afternoon my name is Lisa

dekowski and I am the bureau chief for
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Child Support Services
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
03:40:31.950 --> 03:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
Services Division of economic
 
03:40:34.710 --> 03:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
stability and what have you done for the
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
last uh two months while your rules were
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
expired uh thank you madam chair for the
 
03:40:44.590 --> 03:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
question um our agency has continued to
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh distribute and uh disperse child
 
03:40:49.269 --> 03:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
support payments that we have received
 
03:40:52.030 --> 03:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
over these last uh period of time that
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
the rule has expired naturally our
 
03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
program has a duty to the families that
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
we are serving to ensure that not only
 
03:41:02.429 --> 03:41:02.439 align:start position:0%
are the payments that we are collecting
 
03:41:05.349 --> 03:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of um parents who are ordered
 
03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
by the court to pay support but we also
 
03:41:10.110 --> 03:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to ensure that those
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
payments are dispersed to the families
 
03:41:16.150 --> 03:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
um that are rightfully
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
those payments and uh under the uh
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
Federal uh law of the Social Security
 
03:41:26.389 --> 03:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
Act uh the child support program uh
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
certainly wants to be able to continue
 
03:41:31.630 --> 03:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
that we maintain uh the economic uh and
 
03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
income supports for the families that
 
03:41:35.950 --> 03:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
we're currently serving um so it would
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
have been um perhaps more detrimental
 
03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
had we not been able to provide These
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
funds to the families that we're
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
currently serving um to speak to to the
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
comment about um the federal law not
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
being as uh specific um as the current
 
03:41:57.630 --> 03:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
rule uh is um there are also uh the
 
03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
federal law clearly provides States
 
03:42:04.870 --> 03:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
child support programs
 
03:42:11.070 --> 03:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh the distribution rules for child
 
03:42:13.950 --> 03:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
support cases in addition to that the
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulation
 
03:42:20.189 --> 03:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
also clearly um explain how the
 
03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
distribution of child support payments
 
03:42:27.229 --> 03:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
in state agency should be um dispersed
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
and uh also our current federal our
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
currently federally approved automated
 
03:42:35.950 --> 03:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
system is programmed accordingly to be
 
03:42:38.590 --> 03:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
able to disperse those payments to
 
03:42:41.469 --> 03:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
families um as they are received in a
 
03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
timely fashion um and so uh with that we
 
03:42:49.189 --> 03:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
have um continued to provide that
 
03:42:51.750 --> 03:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
service under these circumstances and we
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
certainly have initiated uh uh quick and
 
03:42:59.870 --> 03:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
fast uh resolutions to try to ensure
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
that the rules um uh are are quickly in
 
03:43:07.229 --> 03:43:07.239 align:start position:0%
place um and that we're not in this
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
situation again thank
 
03:43:11.550 --> 03:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
you well thank you for that ex
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
explanation if the federal laws are that
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
detailed why do we need these rules
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you madam chair it's a it's
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
a great question um there are some
 
03:43:27.149 --> 03:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
options that states have and some states
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
have specific uh fees or interests that
 
03:43:34.030 --> 03:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
they charge in although we don't have
 
03:43:36.910 --> 03:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
specific fees um there are options to
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
how we would distribute certain types of
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
payments based towards aares so the the
 
03:43:45.550 --> 03:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
laws allow uh the rules allow
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
the um us to be able to clarify how we
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
are currently providing for that here in
 
03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire thank you all right any
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
rules the expired rules and which are
 
03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
the same as these interim rules yes yes
 
03:44:06.349 --> 03:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but the question was what have
 
03:44:08.429 --> 03:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
you been doing during the period when
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
the rules were
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
expired thank you for the question um
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
represent we have continued to
 
03:44:16.590 --> 03:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
distribute money as we have received
 
03:44:20.830 --> 03:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
them as they had been
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh documented in the existing rules so
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
we have continued business as usual to
 
03:44:28.349 --> 03:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
support the income for the families and
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
for the paying parents that we are
 
03:44:32.309 --> 03:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
serving yes I would like to mention that
 
03:44:34.830 --> 03:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
for the last 10 years at least it has
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
been explicitly illegal to enforce
 
03:44:40.830 --> 03:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
expired rules so you're very L very
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
lucky that no one has
 
03:44:45.309 --> 03:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
complained because they would be a able
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.720 --> 03:44:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
Authority

03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
03:44:58.030 --> 03:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
so any other questions comments move to
 
03:45:02.630 --> 03:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
approve second by representative Lon
 
03:45:07.229 --> 03:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I I
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
opposed all
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
right the lottery
 
03:45:16.189 --> 03:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
intercept um so this interm rule
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
like the previous one has been filed to
 
03:45:20.070 --> 03:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
minimize the time between the expiration
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
of the effective Rule and the subsequent
 
03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
read-option this rule um has been
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
expired since July 22nd of this year um
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
and this one also has uh a state statute
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
that authorizes the department to
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
intercept this money along with the
 
03:45:41.309 --> 03:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
federal Authority but once again there
 
03:45:44.309 --> 03:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
may be a question about how the program
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
has been
 
03:45:47.550 --> 03:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
collecting and intercepting that money
 
03:45:48.950 --> 03:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
without rules because it's the rules
 
03:45:54.750 --> 03:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
is thank you
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
um similarly um to what I had just
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
previously stated the program has
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
continued um to under the authority of
 
03:46:09.630 --> 03:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
our uh Social Security Act on behalf of
 
03:46:11.870 --> 03:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
the child support program in accordance
 
03:46:15.630 --> 03:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
with the state law um in addition to um
 
03:46:17.550 --> 03:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire lottery
 
03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
commission's uh rule related to the
