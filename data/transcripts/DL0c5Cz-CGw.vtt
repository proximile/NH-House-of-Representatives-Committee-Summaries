00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 121 and recognize
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill um establishes local uh
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
special education advisory councils we
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a state advisory Council referred
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
to a Sac that we've had legislation the
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
last uh couple of sessions on but this
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
is a a local um advisory Council and the
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
intent that this is to be uh parent
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
driven councils um with
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
um parents of special needs children in
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
the district um and I I think it's
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
important that it's parent driven it's
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
district um a district organization per
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
se it's it's a parent
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
organization um to uh look at uh special
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
needs in the district and just walk you
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
through um the bill a couple of points
 
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
um to begin with um and I I'll just
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
mention that um this is the result of U
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
discussions I've had with uh special
 
00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:37.509 align:start position:0%
discussions I've had with uh special
education

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
Advocates so um that's the Genesis of
 
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.909 align:start position:0%
Advocates so um that's the Genesis of
the

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
bill um the um Roman two on the first
 
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
page uh describes the makeup of the
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
council um and again it's uh app parents
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
um in the uh district and if there are
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
multiple towns in the district um there
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be at least one parent from
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
each Town um in the
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
council um the meetings should be open
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
to all uh parents with uh children with
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
disabilities and you'll see enrollment
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
for the duties of the uh Council um one
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
to advise the districts uh the district
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
on um matters of education and safety of
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh their children
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh two is to um meet at least quarterly
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
with a District
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
administration uh to talk about um the
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
special needs uh program in the district
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
uh to look at development um evaluation
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
and planning for services uh to the
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
children in the district who have
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh providing input on
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
policies and practices and procedures in
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
the district
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
and really as a a means of more
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
communication between parents with
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities and uh the
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
school administration we've had I I
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
can't hesit I can't count the number of
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation we've had about
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
special needs um since I've been here um
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
and some of the
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um has been uh
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching um to listen to parents
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that we can improve things
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
by making sure the lines of
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
communication are open between the
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
parents and the school administration so
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's really the um the intent of the
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill um and then on page two um I'd like
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
to see um a workshop U at least annually
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
um to uh to inform uh parents um and to
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions they have about
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
services and the uh Council should uh
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
produce a report at the end of the year
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
that goes to the school board um you
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
know it's important to deal with the
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
administration but uh the school board
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
should know what's uh going on um as
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
well and um there was um established
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
advisory councils and they have an
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
experiences unique perspectives and
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
expertise to influence the decisions and
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
help shape programs and policies at the
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
local level an effective local advisory
 
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
council is more than a meeting it is an
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
approach and a mindset that truly values
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
the advice of parents when parent
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
advisers are valued and engaged through
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
these local advisory councils they can
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
work together with School District staff
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
and community leaders to improve
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
education not only for those with
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities but for all
 
00:13:11.069 --> 00:13:11.079 align:start position:0%
children um and I I think that's uh a
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
great goal and really why I'd like to
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
see these advisory councils um each
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
School District um and uh the advocacy
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
and action has many tools available for
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
um the local advisory councils to get
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
started with including um sample mission
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
statements um and um even um startup
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
checklists and um Flyers uh to uh invite
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh parents to
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
participate so
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh I I think that this
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
legislation um when it comes to special
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
education and maybe is a step um in a
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
different direction than some of the
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
other legislation that we've had in the
 
00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:05.959 align:start position:0%
past and uh I ask your support thank you
 
00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:09.949 align:start position:0%
past and uh I ask your support thank you
very

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
much sorry yes thank you madam chair uh
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh coming here and uh
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
testifying well me testifying but uh but
 
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
question on a clarification on it line
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
four uh the word shall what do
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
particularly put sh instead of
 
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.150 align:start position:0%
particularly put sh instead of
me

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
um basically sha makes it a requirement
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
for the school districts to form such a
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
council um I believe there are some
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
councils in place in some districts uh
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
but I want to make sure that they are
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
parent driven and not um Administration
 
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.670 align:start position:0%
parent driven and not um Administration
Le

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
Le
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
councils thank you um representative
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair um thank
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking me a question um in the
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
event that there is a district without a
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
local parent teacher organization how do
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
we it is enumerated I think there on
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
lines nine and 10 how how would you
 
00:15:15.389 --> 00:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
suggest that folks would navigate that
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think uh an
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
organic uh establishment of a council um
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh I I see as as an option um if there
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
PTA uh representative Terry yes uh thank
 
00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
you representative uh cordelli for your
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
um very uh cachent and helpful uh
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
presentation um with respect to the
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill wondering if
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
you could tell us all um were there
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
other individuals or or groups that
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
contributed to your uh decision to bring
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
this bill forward could you characterize
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
for us um the the the ground swell if
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
there is any or any interest outside of
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
of this body right U it was just working
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
with um a number of uh special education
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
parents and Advocates that um I know
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
from um their uh frequent testimony um
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
before uh this and the previous
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
committee um so it was really
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
um parent
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
driven representative celik thank you
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
madam I have two separate questions if I
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
may um but I will ask for a followup
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate um the the first one
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
goes back to the comment about sh which
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the intent of sha I think
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
of school districts like the one in um
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
um Newington for example where they have
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
one Elementary School in the district
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it so would you be you know
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is up to 11 members I'm trying to
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
understand you know where they would
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
already potentially the you know the
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
parents of the school district's made up
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
of one principal they don't have a large
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
SAU or anything like that because it's
 
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:10.039 align:start position:0%
literally one k to five school um how
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
this would relate to those teeny tiny
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
districts without placing an undue
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
burden um since this is really an
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
organization of parents I I don't see
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
that it would be an uh a burden on the
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
uh School administration or the school
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
district itself um and um I that's why I
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
did not set uh a number of uh members of
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
the council because um of small uh
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
schools and uh districts that have just
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
um uh certain grade levels um such as
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
Newton or Quon and others may follow up
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
go ahead follow so again thinking of of
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
the um Newington School District you
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
know where there's 40 I think 47
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
children in the school so would you
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
think that having one parent would be a
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
sufficient number for a parent Council I
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
mean like I'm trying to think
 
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
proportionate Ely to my district which
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
has 2,000 students to create a
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
multi-member parent group works but
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
where there's only 44 kids or 40s
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
something and some of them are sibling
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
groups how you're going to find parents
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
who have the sufficient time and
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
capacity to do this
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that that would be a local um
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
a local issue but um I think that if
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
there are um parents um with uh children
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
for Disabilities um they would want to
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
um uh take part in this I I don't think
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
that um uh there will be a problem um in
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
finding parents to participate and it
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
could be you know two or three
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
parents you representative Murray thank
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
question um with regard to um the
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
requirement that a district provide
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
adequate B resources available um uh one
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that you have enumerated I
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
I would assume falls under this line but
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
it is in SE section um six on page two
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
line three and four um it talks about
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
answering questions with the regard to
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
the rights of parents so my question to
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
you would be uh in this in in what is
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
considered adequate resources would this
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
be also potentially legal council or
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
some other entity advising parents of
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
what legal rights there are under idea
 
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.230 align:start position:0%
what legal rights there are under idea
um

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily if there is a workshop
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
is outlined you know that could be um
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know those types of questions could
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
be answered at an annual Workshop um but
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
the uh ongoing resources are more in the
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
line of of space um and if uh if they
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to um uh live stream a meeting or
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
something uh something along those lines
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh issues that I put that in because of
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
issues that had come up with the state
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
um advisory Council and um issues um in
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
having resources at the uh Department of
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
Education uh
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
facility yes phip thank you madam chair
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
um and so and the other question I did
 
00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
have with with regard to the 11 or so
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
members as determined locally um how do
 
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
you determine how or how do you ensure
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
that a broad swath of um special
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
education needs are being represented
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
within this uh group of parent Advocates
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
there are a myriad of issues that um
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
parents deal with with children with
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
special ed needs so I you
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
know yeah I I didn't want to get into um
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know a number of parents with um
 
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
this category of disability child or
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
that I I would leave that up to uh local
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
decision-making but but hopefully they
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
would um Encompass um various um needs
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
children so I I I guess my curiosity is
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
then um are you asking parents to
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
self-disclose a a child's disability in
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
the application form or I I'm just
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that there is when
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about making sure that all
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
children are heard in a way that um
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
there there are so many different needs
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
with children idea sure um yes um um
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I uh um said that the meeting
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
should be open to all parents of
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities also so if um
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
there is uh someone with a particular um
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
child with unique situation um you know
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
they would be welcome um I I know I have
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
a daughter who's a special ed teacher
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
and for many years did life skills um
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
classes so that's definitely um a unique
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
uh set of students and uh um if there is
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
such a class I would hope a parent with
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
one of those childrens um would be uh
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
involved in the council as
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
well I'm gonna ask a question too do you
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
see any um connection at all between the
 
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
state advisory Council and any of these
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
councils um no
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
Direct a tie um you know perhaps the
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
local districts um could um provide
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
feedback to the state advisory Council
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe a good practice would
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
be for them uh someone from the local
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
Council to periodically uh be in contact
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
with the state Council or even appear at
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
their meetings and uh you know possibly
 
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
have the annual report uh sent to the
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
state advisory Council as well thank you
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative cel then thank you again
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about the makeup of parents as
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
those representing children who are have
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
varying types of learning disabilities
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
disabilities I I'm trying to understand
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
how we're not violating the privacy of
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
the student through this because you
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
know um teachers aren't allowed to
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
disclose who in a classroom has an IEP
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
or 504 students who are receiving
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
special education services in settings
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
outside of the regular classroom
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
obviously you're identifi ifed as going
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
to that room but I'm just concerned that
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
this for students um who may already be
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
struggling with the stigma around having
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
an IEP or a learning disability um and I
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
speak from a place of experience around
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
this um that that having other parents
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
CE oh so you're one of those parents and
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
so I just wonder how this avoids that
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
potential um yeah I I don't know how
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
specific um the organization has to be
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of um saying we want you know a
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
parent um you know with a child with you
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
know ex disability or ex uh um learning
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
impairment um and I don't know that at
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
the council meetings um you parents are
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
free to disclose what they want to
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
disclose I don't think think it's a
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
requirement um in any way that um their
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
child's situation need to be
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
disclosed um you so I I I'm sorry I
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't see it as a a problem really um
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock and then thank
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
you chairman good morning representative
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
qu again earlier morning CL I a couple
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
simple questions I'm assuming the
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty of the parent organizations
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
and the selection and the applic process
 
00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't say doesn't say here
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
who facilitates that of organizing that
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
and and I I know now that some local
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
organiz schools already have that I'm
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
not sure why we even need this but I
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
understand that but the part that I'm
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
assuming that's your intent that that
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
they'll sort of help up step up and help
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
out the part that concerned the cand is
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
is line 22 and
 
00:25:24.149 --> 00:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
23 um on the uh draft of this bill and
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
it talks specifically about this
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
organization being part of the
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation of District special education
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
programs and I'm not sure what that
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
means I'm not sure how a parent advis
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
committee should be in the official role
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
of evaluating School District programs
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh this program or any other particular
 
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
program and I don't know how it's going
 
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
to play out I think I just see that as a
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
conflict um between being advisory to
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
the board to the administration and they
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
say we're going to be the ones that are
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
going to help evaluate this that really
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
concerns me right um I view
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation um more in uh looking and uh
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
experience um with um the programs at
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
the school and the parents um advising
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
um based on their
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
experience um I I view that as the
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
meaning of evaluation their experience
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
and observations um of uh various uh
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
programs and services um you know if
 
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
there are um issues with uh um
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
you I certain uh certain meetings IEP
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
meetings um I would think that they
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
would want to make the district would
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
want to know parents opinions on um what
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
is taking place and uh ways that uh uh
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
things could be improved uh for uh the
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
parents as well and the children
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you m thank you representative
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you for taking the
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
question are you simply looking to give
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
these parents of children with special
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
needs of voice and would the 11 members
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
be completely
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh right participation is
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
voluntary yes and that's why I uh
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
started out by saying This was
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
parent-driven um you know I want parents
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
to have a um a voice um and uh provide
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
feedback um as um was outlined um by the
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
director of U advocacy and act action um
 
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
you know it should be um a teamwork
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
effort between parents and School
 
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
administration uh to make sure that uh
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
adequate uh services to those childrens
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
are are being
 
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.470 align:start position:0%
are are being
provided

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
followup again just confirming under the
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue since they are the parents
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
and it's volunteer it would be up to
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
them whether or not they share any of
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
what is going on within their child's
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
life that is correct thank you in my
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you representative Terry
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh just returning for a
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
moment to lines 22 and 23 could you
 
00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:16.350 align:start position:0%
moment to lines 22 and 23 could you
confirm

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
confirm
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
or disagree with my reading that the
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
role of the parents with respect to
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
these uh meetings and participation in
 
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Planning Development evaluation of
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
the District special education programs
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
that they would be the role of the
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
parents would be contributory and not
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
determinative because they don't have a
 
00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:38.799 align:start position:0%
vote and and they they're not charged
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
with making the decisions so we're
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
casting a wide net bringing in and I
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
hate to over use of the term
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but they're important
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
people and should be heard would you
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
agree with that yes um yeah I am I
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
reading that correctly yeah I I don't uh
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh anticipate or see that a value a
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
would um mean any kind of scorecard and
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
Grading of programs um anything like
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
that it's right based on experience
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Murray and then
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you madam chair um thank you
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question with regard to
 
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
line 28 on page one um the way I'm
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
reading this and correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
this is a council responsibility of this
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
11 person uh Council to serve as a
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
resource for parents is including
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
providing information on state and
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
federal rights to students is that what
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
you meant that the that that the body
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
itself provides its own information on
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
States and federal rights I I would
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
think that they would be uh they would
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
have um information available for
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
instance on um uh the parent information
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
center that they could provide um to uh
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
you know um you know websites phone
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
numbers those types of resources for
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
further information for parents uh
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center parent
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
information center those
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
organizations representative
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
Bon thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
for uh taking my question um as you know
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the state advisory committee is now
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
bit disbanded because of uh difficulty
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
in getting membership so starting again
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
at the beginning so uh part of my
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
concern is getting enough interested
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
parents to do this as a um and to just
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
go on them and also with the composition
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee itself um it in
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
advisory capacity um you have parents
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
who have a lot of individual experiences
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
and know a lot about the law and I
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
applaud the abil the the concept is
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
great I think that parents should be
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
involved um and the workshop is an
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
excellent idea to man mandate an
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
excellent Workshop giving them all that
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
information um but if it is an advisory
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee and you only have parents on
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
the committee with their knowledge um
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's no um people on that committee
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
that do have institutional knowledge on
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
it would it behoove the committee uh to
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
um put like one educational professional
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
on it as well thank you um I I would
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
certainly um see them inviting in um uh
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
professional people maybe uh maybe
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
someone from the disability rights
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
Center or
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
um uh even uh the special education
 
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate to come in and talk uh to the
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
parents and maybe answer questions that
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
they have um provide them some guidance
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I I don't see it as a
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
closed meeting between the parents um
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
but certainly being able to um invite
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
someone in um you know much like we do
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
with study
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
committees followup please followup
 
00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:00.519 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that I was just
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
wondering since it is phrase as an
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
advisory Council being on a school board
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
myself anytime we have any kind of
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
advisory committees to the school board
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh the school board is involved in the
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
selection of those members on the parent
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh teachers associations or that they
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
they serve a different Mission this is a
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
very specific Mission and um I would
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
think that you would want Schoolboard
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
members involved in uh deciding who
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
you were you looking for an for an
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
answer I I I took a different direction
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of the uh initial
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
organization representative Murray then
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative Paul thank you uh Madam
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
chair um with respect to the fiscal
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
analysis or the methodology it does seem
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
to indicate that there might be some
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
cost to the local um community and local
 
00:32:57.399 --> 00:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
cost to the local um community and local
expenditure

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
um so I was curious um because you are
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
requiring certain
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
um things to be provided by the district
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
I I wonder where we are at in
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
understanding the scope of what the cost
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
potentially could
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
be I I don't Envision um a large cost at
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
all um you know maybe at some point
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
there there might be some uh
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
copying um
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh I I I I don't see a large cost Factor
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure that I'm I'm right so the power of
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
this committee is really through the
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
parent teacher organization cor right in
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the makeup of the committee
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
they make the decisions on who serves it
 
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.669 align:start position:0%
they make the decisions on who serves it
on

00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
it I I think that there is a a section
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
I think there was something in here
 
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.029 align:start position:0%
I think there was something in here
about

00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies but it
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh the initial setup should should be um
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
Again by by parents I think um and the
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
membership should be parents I I
 
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
definitely want this um to be uh a
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
parent organization rather than a uh
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
District ad
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh District
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
organization followup
 
00:34:36.669 --> 00:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
followup um so and thank you for taking
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
my question again so they're making it
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
up so this the PTO is choosing the
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
people on this Council those PTO members
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
may not be special needs parents at all
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
and probably not and they are the ones
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to choose these folks
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
from from the um from the parents who
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
indicate interest in being on the
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
council yes so but but all of it the
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
makeup of the committee lies with the
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
parent teacher organization if you don't
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
have a parent teacher organization as
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
what mentioned earlier then that could
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
be problematic but okay thank you
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield no okay
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you madam
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
chair my other question is with regard
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
to like the PTO PTA status I mean as far
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
as how they operate generally is a like
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
a fundraising organization arm of school
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
does this potentially put any of those
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
efforts at risk because we're
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
co-mingling efforts between District
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
initiatives and yeah I I don't see that
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're just involved in um uh selecting
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
um parents who want to be on the council
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to be council
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
members um unless they have a child with
 
00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:51.710 align:start position:0%
members um unless they have a child with
a

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
disability all
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
right represent s um would you amend
 
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
this to to allow guardianship as well as
 
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
parents or does it have to be this
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
specifies parents and not Guardians yeah
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
it probably should include parents or
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
Guardians yes okay any other
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you oh representative
 
00:36:16.829 --> 00:36:16.839 align:start position:0%
Richfield thank you madam chair and
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
you be open to any other organizations

possible if you look at like disability
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
is diversity and if you look at a Field
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
of Flowers every single flower is
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
different but it still makes that
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
field so getting back to um the concern
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
of child privacy that was brought up by

representative Murray um and also
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
s my story when I tell my story it takes

back the power for my children and my
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
family Disability should not be shamed
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
it should be celebrated and if we use
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
Universal Divine then we can help
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
everybody benefits of a a CPAC help

barrier is off the table to be able to

for representative Cel and then
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
represent thank you so much and thank
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and for your
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
very impressive testimony um would would
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
you also encourage um if it's a school
 
00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
district that has more than one grade uh
 
00:49:20.789 --> 00:49:20.799 align:start position:0%
like like an elementary school but a
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
district that is multi- levels that this
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
say that should it be appropriate it uh
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
reflect a variety of age levels well and
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
I think that's how I read the bill was
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
that it was District by District so to
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
me being an exitor I'm siu6 and we have
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
five schools six schools in siu6 so to
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
me there would be representation from
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
all towns and schools on this parent
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
advisory committee representative
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
so much for sharing your story and for
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
my initial question which I think you
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
might have already covered um but
 
00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:03.799 align:start position:0%
initially when I looked at this and I
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
was seeing PTO I was kind of going down
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
the Avenue of should we actually have
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
maybe the school nurse be involved or a
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor because they know the
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
children's specific history versus
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
having it out there with the PTO
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
although I feel guilty saying that
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
because there is no shame in it and you
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
made a great point right um I'm just
 
00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
wondering if I could ask you as a parent
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
and as someone in the field how do you
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
feel about that do you do you feel PTO
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
or do you think maybe nurse guidance
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
counselor or I don't think the PTO has
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
um is at least in my lived
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
experience the experience I mean there
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
are members of my PTO that do have
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities and do have
 
00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:50.839 align:start position:0%
IEPs I'm not saying that but I cannot
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
say that a PTO is the expert on choosing
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
members for a special ed committee
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
to me it's by open
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
application and if we're building
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
involvement with
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers and special
 
00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:10.599 align:start position:0%
Educators and the people who are making
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
the policy then the parents do want a
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
voice in that so to me this this um CPAC
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
is building a bridge between the people
 
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
who are making the policies and the
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
people who live the
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
policies and having that com
 
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
conversation and having people with
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities and parents and families
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
and Guardians who have children with
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities express some of those
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
things that sound like a good idea but
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
really when you implement it it
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
backfires so really opening that
 
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
conversation and that's where I really
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
see this committee thriving is that it
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
gives way that as parent I'm not sitting
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
at a table with all these
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
professionals and I'm the expert of my
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
children right I'm also an occupational
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
therapist so I do demand my goals are
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
measurable and I I highlight so I have a
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
different Viewpoint um and I have more I
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
think validity because I'm a
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
professional where I think a lot of my
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
friends that are just parents feel like
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
oh I'm just the parent so I think a a
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
committee like this really puts
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
everybody at an even place
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're not making policy but we're
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
discussing policy we're getting
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
education we're we're bringing in pick
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
we're bringing in DD councel we're
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
bringing in information from um UNH
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
Institute of disability we're educating
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
this the staff we're educating the
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
parents and we're helping to just work
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
together and I think that is how I took
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
the point of this spill and I may be
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect but I have testified and and
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to know I'm not going to
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
tell horror
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
stories that you had mentioned but when
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
I tell my story people are like how are
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
you even
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
alive and I'll tell you right
 
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
now there were days I didn't want to be
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
because it's really hard thank you
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
follow followup thank
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
you two parts if I may so I just want to
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
confirm I heard you that you said open
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
application yep not through the PTO no
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
through the school board through the
 
00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
school board okay thank you and then um
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
I had just assumed the 11 parents would
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
be parents all parents of children with
 
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
special needs that's not how I read that
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay I read 11 parents and um to me uh
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
my perception would be I would I do want
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
I think because we're talking about
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
students in general disabilities and not
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities I think it's really
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
important that you have a myriad of
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
everybody with
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
expertise because ultimately we want
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
inclusion I don't want my my son or
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
daughter put in a
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
room with a teacher where they have no
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
social interaction except for at lunch
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
my kids haven't had friends since second
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
grade like peers feared my
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
children so to me if their needs were
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
met and their classrooms were set up in
 
00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
a way that benefited everybody
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
and you had you would actually be
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
creating opportunities for Te for
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
students to become and want to be OTS
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
pts speech and language Pathologists
 
00:54:41.470 --> 00:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
teachers principles because they are
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
then the peer teachers of children with
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities and then the benefits of my
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
children have friends and peers and
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
models so I think you know I wouldn't
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
say it has to be all parents with just
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh andard audience with disabilities I
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
think it I would request that half have
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
our families and or self- Advocates or
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
staff with disabilities because they
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
have the LED experience they know what's
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
wored what they've been through what
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't and to your point um and I
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
cannot remember who had said it but that
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
every every parent and every child with
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
experiences and we work the best when
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
we're collaborating and we're
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
brainstorming as a team I don't want to
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
interrupt but could you shut the doors
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
there please sure thank you any other
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:38.359 align:start position:0%
I do have
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
pass

00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%

four thank you I'd like to call Vanessa
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
Madam chair members of the committee
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing me today
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
my name is Vanessa blae and I serve as
 
00:56:13.029 --> 00:56:13.039 align:start position:0%
the Director of policy in planning at
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Council on
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities um and we
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
love it when parents come here and do
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
our job for us um we are here today
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
because we want to Second um our
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
concerns about the stipulations in this
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
policy um it's on its face it's a great
 
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
idea we want parents um with students in
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
supportive education to have their
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
voices heard um we believe that it's
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
very important in the advancements of
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
inclusion and integration in the
 
00:56:47.549 --> 00:56:47.559 align:start position:0%
education system um we have concerns
 
00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:49.799 align:start position:0%
about the membership stipulations or
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
what we think our lack of um I'll try to
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
be as brief as possible I members of our
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
staff and members of our Council sit on
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
many advisory committees um some of them
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
are successful and some of them are not
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times it really comes down
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
to how well the policy that formulated
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
that advisory committee is written um a
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
lot of times we go back to our statute
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
and we look and see what who what is our
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
committee supposed to be made up of um
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
what are are their goals what are their
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um so we really believe
 
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
that this um bill could use a little bit
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
more work in order to give the voices
 
00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
that we want to be heard a chance to be
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
heard um and we also want to keep in
 
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
mind that unfortunately there's a lot of
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
divisiveness in communities around
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
supportive education because a lot of
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
people think it's expensive um so we
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that when we're
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
creating an advisory committee that is
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
created in a way that demands respect
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
from the people who are involved um and
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
not something that is going to become
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
ineffective because of voices that are
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
drowning out um the other voices that
 
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
that should be heard because when we
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
improve supportive education we improve
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
education for all of our students and we
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
have to keep that in mind this is this
 
00:58:23.309 --> 00:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
is the aim for all of us we all want our
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
children to have the best education that
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
they possibly can have have um our
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
membership is made up of 60% of people
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
with the lived experience of disability
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
and or their parents or Guardians and
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
they are very happy to have the
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work um with legislators
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
on giving their input on what they feel
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
would be impactful legislation so please
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
feel free to reach out to our Council
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
anytime um and we are very happy to talk
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you madam chair and
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
clearly you you think the concept is
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
good but you're recommending some
 
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
changes other uh you just mentioned
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
really one specific one in terms of me
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh membership are there other um
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
suggestions you would make to make our
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
statute better um typically the council
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't directly make suggestions about
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment changes I can I can say that
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
we believe that um the application
 
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
process and the the theory of having
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
pto's um formulate the Committees um
 
00:59:46.829 --> 00:59:46.839 align:start position:0%
would not give leverage necessarily in
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
certain districts to the voices of
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
people who should be heard in
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
formulating the committee um we're also
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about the smaller districts
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
because you know New Hampshire is we're
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
a weird State we have big districts and
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
we have tiny districts and we want to
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that um if we're going to task
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
districts to um have this kind of
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and and respect this
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
advisory committee um that we have to
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
consider all of the different makeups of
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
the districts when we're when we're
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
creating this type of legislation I hope
 
01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
that answers your
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
question it does thank you
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative litfield thank
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
so I understand what you're saying about
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
smaller districts there are being issues
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
my question to you
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
is right now you're correct maybe in
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
certain districts there are certain
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
people that maybe they feel resentful
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
toward that special education budget and
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
maybe they need more education on that
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this be a great way to kind of
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
bring light to that and to bring the
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
groups together do you know what I'm
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
saying like in other words humanize the
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
situation where if you have let's say
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
six parents of children with special
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
needs and then six parents not or
 
01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:14.039 align:start position:0%
something on this committee but you're
 
01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
bringing them together where you may
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
Forge bonds or friendships or see things
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
in a different light that you may not
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
have before and it may even lead to
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness to something as simple as
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
a birthday party which which is not so
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
simple when you're in second grade
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
because it's all relative what is your I
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
just feel as though this bill might be a
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
great first step to breaking the ice and
 
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:37.640 align:start position:0%
I'm confused about the hesitation so I'd
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
love to hear your feedback on that the
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
the hesitation isn't necessarily about
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
forming the advisory councils it's it's
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
just cautioning that when we are
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
developing this type of legislation that
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
we want to take those things into
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
consideration of course we want all
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
parents to understand the benefits of
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
providing equal education for all of our
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
students um the smaller
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
districts it's it it can be difficult
 
01:02:11.470 --> 01:02:11.480 align:start position:0%
for parents because they are a target of
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
harassment um in certain places because
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the cost of of special education
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's it's something that happens it's
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um we're not we don't
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
believe it should stop this type of um
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for parents to be heard we
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we are not
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
creating an environment that would
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
harassment any other questions thank you
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate thank you and I'd
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for having me um you sit
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
real close to the mic sit real close
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um thank you very much for
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
inviting me up here
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
um I am 100% for this bill I have a
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
almost 9-year-old son um and hearing you
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
speak of your family um I know that
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
someone had mentioned about maybe having
 
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
someone had mentioned about maybe having
a

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
nurse I think it was you know choose I
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
come from a district that has um Four
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
elementary schools and it's all
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
considered one District there's not
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
different Wars in it um and I don't
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
think I I know you had also mentioned
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
where the school board um maybe could
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
help in choosing the parents for the
 
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
committee um I don't think all school
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
school boards are aware of what we're
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
being put through as
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
parents um I don't think I think it gets
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
to a point where and and with
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
confidentiality too when we're brought
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
in for an IEP meeting we have to meet
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
down in the lobby and then you get
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
walked up to the same room so everyone
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
knows why you're going to that room
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
because there is you've got the entire
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
IEP team in that room the door is closed
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
so they know you have someone with who
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
has an IEP or vial 4 so there's no way
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
of keeping that as I mean when you walk
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
through the school and you're brought up
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
to that room everybody
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
knows she's here because her son has
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
something my son has s
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities I've been fighting his IEP
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
since October of 23 we have not come to
 
01:05:03.319 --> 01:05:05.349 align:start position:0%
since October of 23 we have not come to
an

01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:09.309 align:start position:0%
an
agreement

01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
and I had to learn all this on my own
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
and then I did end up getting an
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
advocate from conquer um immediately
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
when the doctors had started noticing it
 
01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:22.839 align:start position:0%
I went and took every book out on
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
IEPs and 504s from the local library and
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
read every single one of them I've had a
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
neuros pych done on my
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
son this school district will not agree
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
to it 38 Pages he has 11 eye diagnosises
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
as well as six other diagnosises he's on
 
01:05:42.359 --> 01:05:43.829 align:start position:0%
as well as six other diagnosises he's on
the

01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:47.109 align:start position:0%
the
Spectrum

01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
and when you try to he is he has the
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
bigest heart he's not a behavioral he's
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
an introvert so he can't Express that at
 
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
school without being scared inside those
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
walls so and I know each parent has a
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
different I volunteered at his school in
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
the office and I know each parent has
 
01:06:15.269 --> 01:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
different they they see different
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
things do I think having someone from
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
the IEP team so to speak choose um which
 
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
parents no because they ultimately have
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
the final say you don't you can say what
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
you how you feel but ultimately they're
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
the ones who make up that IEP they're
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
the ones who say yes or no so I don't
 
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
think that they should be able to yes
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
they may know some of the things maybe a
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
special ed
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
teacher can join in on that I don't
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
think the nurse knows fully to what
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
extent they may know some of the medical
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
conditions But ultimately when it comes
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
down to it it's us parents who know what
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
we go through I
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
know and I'll give an example I I get
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
criticized because I don't ask my son
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
the minute he walks through the door how
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
was your day at
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
school I can't because that triggers him
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
and he's in his safe
 
01:07:23.549 --> 01:07:23.559 align:start position:0%
place so with this being said I I just
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
can't I think it would be great for
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
other for committee to be able to
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
discuss these things and have them maybe
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
meet up so I know with board meetings
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's the non-public board meeting
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
prior to maybe once a month have the
 
01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:44.839 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that of the parents
 
01:07:47.269 --> 01:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
meet up or have one's for the the
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
chairperson of that committee go in and
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
speak and speak the concerns because
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
right now you can't get into a non
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
board public meeting without going
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
through a very long process to get there
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and you could be denied when asking that
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
so in that aspect I
 
01:08:11.269 --> 01:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
think I like the fact of having some
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
parents that don't under don't have a
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
child with disabilities but they don't
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
all understand they could sit there and
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
look at you like why is he having a
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
meltdown all he did was trip
 
01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
but you as a parent know why he is
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
meltdown I know if my son comes home and
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
he has a
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
meltdown something happened at school
 
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
but I have to let him tell me I can't
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
pull it out of him so in that case I
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
guess with the the the Privacy there's
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
no privacy in our district because you
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
walk in like I said you walk into a room
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
and I am I am I embarrassed of myself
 
01:08:59.309 --> 01:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
son absolutely not because I chose at 40
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
to have this child that was a miracle I
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
myself have health
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
issues um but it is literally a
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
full-time job to advocate for
 
01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
them and I think that had I not gone and
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
learned what I did or read the laws in
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
the library I don't and I don't think
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
some parents have time to do that I only
 
01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
because I am disabled
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
I had time to go and do
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
it so in that case I 100% think it would
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
be amazing to have this type of
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to have them voice
 
01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that we're having I've been
 
01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
going to the budget meetings and the
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
school board meetings just to learn so I
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
could see what the schools are going
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
through maybe there's something I can do
 
01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
through maybe there's something I can do
to

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
help um so so in that case I I 100% for
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
this but as to who would choose
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
it I I don't know if I could go with
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
anyone from the I AP team let's see if
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
people have questions okay thank you
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for
 
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.430 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for
representative

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you thank you and thank
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
you for sharing and I do want to say
 
01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
that your son is a miracle and he's very
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
blessed to have you thank you thank you
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
for being here today
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
so my question to you is and I I heard
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
you say you don't really know who should
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
be the one to pick yeah I don't know
 
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
either I don't know if the rest of the
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
committee does my my gut feeling is not
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
PTO or PTA um I don't know if School
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
Board is best I had brought up nurse
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
only because of the confidentiality
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
Factor although you're right there
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
probably is no confidentiality would you
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
be comfortable with it being the school
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
board if the school board was well aware
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
of what issues going on with special
 
01:10:59.790 --> 01:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
education in within their
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
District I then I would feel comfortable
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
um with that I I I think there in that
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
case um there are a couple on our school
 
01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
board that would be wonderful to choose
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
from them because they do
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
um they do see that uh
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
they they're for the kids and it's not
 
01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
money thank you any other questions
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning thank you for
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
coming in it's always difficult to
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
testify something so personal we
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate your input early on in your
 
01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
conversation you indicated that I think
 
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
if I heard you rightly correctly um that
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
she'd go on to uh the the uh advocacy to
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
get an advocate in conget and my
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
question is did that work for you we are
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
still working he is amazing
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
The Advocate that I got so the
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
the man yes thank you so the process of
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
having a a Advocate that's already
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
provided that already knows the laws and
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
all things seems to be working Su
 
01:12:12.149 --> 01:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
success successfully in terms of more
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
particular perhaps better than a a local
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
organization of PTA
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
people um yes I'm also on the PTA for
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
our district so um I do a lot of
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
volunteering with that
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
um but with the advocate I know that
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
there is only a certain amount that
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
conquer has for the entire State okay so
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
it makes it difficult I mean he he
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
guides on Timothy's behalf but what we
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
want to say and I sorry I didn't mean to
 
01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
mention my son's name but on my son's
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
behalf he does advise on that but in the
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
beginning I didn't have an advocate I
 
01:12:56.669 --> 01:12:56.679 align:start position:0%
had to wait several months do yeah
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
different is okay thank you so much for
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you Mr any other
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that thank you very
 
01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much like to call
 
01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much like to call
Heather

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
Barker good morning thank you for
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
letting me speak I am the student
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
service director for nhsaa here in
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
conquer previously I was a director of
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
student services in a school district
 
01:13:29.189 --> 01:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
and before that I worked for many years
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
as an administrator and educator in a
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
large Middle School here in New
 
01:13:34.709 --> 01:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as both a general Ed and
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
administrator I actually love the idea
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
of um a parent advisory Council in fact
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
director I had one in the school
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
district that I worked in I would love
 
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
to say I would fully support this bill
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
however I think it does need some
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
reworking I think it's invaluable to
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
have parent voice in an advising way uh
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
I do think there is a separation between
 
01:14:06.590 --> 01:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
advocacy when a parent needs an advocate
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that that Avenue in special
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
education and procedural safeguards and
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
rights however I think as a director uh
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
when I came into my position there was
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
already an established Council they met
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
with the director and the superintendent
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
monthly uh it could be virtual as we
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
moved into that virtual place it would
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
be in person it was usually a
 
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
combination cuz some parents could not
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
leave they had things going on with
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
their children so it was flexible in
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
that manner we established they the
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
parents established sort of the uh
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
operations of it we didn't have a formal
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
secretary and all those pieces although
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
we kept notes and we shared those we
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
partnered it with a I ran a weekly
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
parent conversation which was a zoom
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
call for any parent to come into a live
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
zoom and talk about what was going on in
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
our district and things they wanted help
 
01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
with so really creating voice for all
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
parents but this advisory Council was
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
really crucial and if you look down at
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 22 23 24 25 and 26 27 and
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
28 okay they did a phenomenal job
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
advising me as to what was going on at
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
the different levels so we had a
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative for preschool we had a
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative for each of the levels in
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
our district there were three lower
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
elementaries an upper elementary a
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
middle and a high school and I also
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
included an at a District Parent because
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
I felt it was very important to hear
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
what their lived experiences were and to
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
find opportunities for those children
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
and youth to connect somehow in their
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
communities since this is where they
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
lived so in terms of membership and all
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
those pieces it was homegrown so I'm not
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting you want to leave it up to
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
Homegrown but I do think having if you
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
go up in that uh the paragraph two as
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
other members uh other folks have said
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
here today I love the idea of an
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
application process however it is very
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
hard to get people to join things so
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
some people these were all volunteers or
 
01:16:09.149 --> 01:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
we sought them out and I actually did
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
not seek out parents who were having a
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
wonderful experience with special
 
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
education in the district I was really
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing from parents who
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
were not having that experience I also
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
felt it was terribly important um to
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
understand as we were making policy or
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh transition between Grade
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
spans uh special education process
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
procedure forms as as simplest forms I
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
did not know that all the different
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
buildings had their own forms as a
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
parent moving through that it changed
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
every time you went to a new place so
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
without having had that advisory Council
 
01:16:47.629 --> 01:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have known that when we did
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
things like um at the high school when
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
kids would go home for testing midterms
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
and finals all of our students who are
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
in very specialized programs who were
 
01:16:59.790 --> 01:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
not participating that also went home I
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know about that till parents told
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
me that and we made the change so those
 
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
students and their program people
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
because all that staff was there we kept
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
them at school so there were wonderful
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
things that came out of having that
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
parent voice and that
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
participation with the student service
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
director and the superintendent I
 
01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
brought I had a weekly um administrative
 
01:17:24.629 --> 01:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
counsil of our entire District all the
 
01:17:27.669 --> 01:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
ad administrators we I had a standing
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
conversation there was a time every
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
single month when I talked about what
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
parents talked about what were some of
 
01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
their concerns and issues and we
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
addressed those so I came into that
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
culture and I kept it going but I found
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
it invaluable so for me if we looked at
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
um having the PTA I know just from my
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
own experience and working with in
 
01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
schools and also in the communities
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
where I have lived there's they're
 
01:17:56.910 --> 01:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
having trouble getting people even
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
attending PTA or PTO meetings so I'm not
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
sure that's the right Avenue um maybe it
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
is a school board member and the
 
01:18:06.430 --> 01:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
director I think not having the director
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
or someone like that participating to
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
understand and hear what the concerns
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
are even if you make them a listening
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
member I'm not sure um I think you're
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
going to miss out on that piece uh
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
because that's how that can be brought
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
to the district and actually have action
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
take place so this is an informing group
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
an advising group but if we actually
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
want to affect positive change for all
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
students and our most vulnerable
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
Learners we really need to have people
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
at that table who can actually bring
 
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
that forward to other places I also love
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
having the uh the reporting out to the
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
community having that quarterly meeting
 
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
with folks with the parents and
 
01:18:47.350 --> 01:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
attendance we did not do that that's a
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
great idea so I think this is a
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful idea and with either
 
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
amendments or some reworking some of the
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
language I would fully support this
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any other questions uh
 
01:19:02.590 --> 01:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
representative B Bon uh thank you madam
 
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
question um could you just uh I I'm
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
didn't quite get it at the beginning uh
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
what was your role in two things what
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
was your role and what was the size of
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
the district that you were working with
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
sure so um my role in The District was
 
01:19:20.189 --> 01:19:20.199 align:start position:0%
the student director of student services
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
so central office
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
administrator responsible for overseeing
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
all of the the special education in the
 
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
all of the the special education in the
school

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
district and the size of the district
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
was 3600
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
students you representative Murray um
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair thanks for
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if I heard you
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
correctly you said you would be in
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
support of stratifying perhaps the mix
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
of cohort of of participants to be
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
preschool elementary middle and high
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
school age Learners to make sure that
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
you're getting a broad section of a
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
lived experience for those Learners in
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
those age groups yeah let me respond to
 
01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
that so we our group was actually it was
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
six members they were all parents who
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
had children with disabilities I do love
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
the idea of including a couple I don't
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
know how many I see when you start to
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
get too big it's a challenge right but
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
having uh parents who do not have
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities is also
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
helpful having an educator there if you
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
could do that that would be great um or
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
other members we had people Flex in and
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
out of that group we invited people to
 
01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
come in fact we partnered with P the
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
parent information center we offered
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
parent evenings and did trainings based
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
on surveys that that group working with
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
me sent out to parents what do you want
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
more information about a lot of parents
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand the specialed
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
process to be able to Advocate better
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
for their child and IEP team meetings
 
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted training so we partnered
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
with pck I encouraged and the parents uh
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually became went through the
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
advocacy training that we made a
 
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
brochure that group made a brochure that
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
that went to out it was available at
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
parent nights and at the beginning of
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
the year and it was
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
online okay they had a they had a
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
Facebook page they had a social media
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
presence and they had their own contact
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
information so parents knew at each
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
building they could contact that person
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
for help and I often got phone calls
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
from those folks saying that a parent
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was Anonymous sometimes the
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
parent they connected me to a parent who
 
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
parent they connected me to a parent who
was

01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing difficulty around a
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
situation and I partnered with the
 
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
parent in the school right to wrap
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
around that situation so there are so
 
01:21:42.310 --> 01:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
many things positive things that can
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
happen from this I think truthfully it
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
depends on the size of the
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
district that's where I think there has
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
to be some leeway in the language of How
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
It's configured because that's going to
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
be important so again you can't say
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a rep of all those
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
places but in my district given its size
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
to me it was terribly important to have
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
all of those pieces so that you really
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
understood that one of the other values
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
was many of the parents who were in the
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
upper elementary middle and high school
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
had experienced preschool and the lower
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
elementary so there were some really
 
01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.709 align:start position:0%
elementary so there were some really
great

01:22:17.709 --> 01:22:17.719 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
conversations about either things that
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
had remained challenges or barriers or
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
things that had improved or things we
 
01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about about so I think
 
01:22:27.669 --> 01:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
when you start thinking about the that's
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
where I'm saying it might need a little
 
01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
where I'm saying it might need a little
more

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
work represent s thank you thank you
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for taking my
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
question sure um would would you be
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable if the makeup of the group
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
was made up of people who not only
 
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
volunteered to be on it but who had made
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
contact with whomever the special
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
services director was for that district
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
for the so that they would be able to
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
maintain whatever privacy they chose but
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
also in terms of you know abilities and
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
not or or challenges and then also um
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
ensuring that Brad her
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
overview so having listened to the
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that I heard I'm not sure all
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
parents would feel that the student
 
01:23:13.950 --> 01:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
services director if there was a
 
01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
conflict going on between the school and
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
the parent would feel that that's the
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
person so I'm not really sure for me it
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
was really very clear that I was very
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
open to having that parent voice and I'm
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
not s suggesting other directors are not
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
but I do think that that might create
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
hesitation how it initially worked was
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
um I sought
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
volunteers um they met with me very
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
briefly there was no interview nothing
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
like that I had other folks that were on
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
that advisory Council suggest parents um
 
01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
parents came to my office and said I'd
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
like to be on this so
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
that was how it happened but again this
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
was a Grassroots thing it was a local
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
thing um I an invaluable thing so I
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
think finding a pathway to create this
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for parents to have a voice
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
and to truly be our partners in special
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
education which will ultimately impact
 
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:13.709 align:start position:0%
education which will ultimately impact
right

01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
inclusion general education education
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
for all children we are certainly better
 
01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.110 align:start position:0%
for all children we are certainly better
together

01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
so good follow so would you potentially
 
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
recommend an amendment that would say
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
that each district should determine the
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
best strategy for creating the group
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
based on the size and needs of their
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
district with the caveat that perhaps
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
you have if you have a robust PTA
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
there's some membership from there
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
helping with that so that bridges that
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
concern that some parents might have
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
that oh I wouldn't be included because
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
I've been in Conflict something like
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
that I think there has to be some Avenue
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
for all parents to be able if they want
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
to participate to actually be able to if
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility I I would be
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
thrilled if this was there were so many
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
parents that wanted to do this I you
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
know that they were all applying I'm not
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
sure that will be the case that would be
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
great any other
 
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
Wilson good morning madam M chair
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony today uh for the
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
record Becky Wilson from the New
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association uh
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly share and support the
 
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
underlying premise of this bill to try
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there are Avenues and
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
good communication between school
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
districts School boards and parents with
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities um however to share some of
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns from previous speakers we'd
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
like to just offer uh we do have some
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
concerns about some of the language in
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
the bill and a few other points I just
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
would like to make um we'd like to just
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
REM as the previous speaker said many
 
01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:01.239 align:start position:0%
districts do have um I won't call them
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
parent advisory councils but student
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
family Partnerships Family School
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
partnership groups focused on uh the
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
provision for students with disabilities
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
in their districts I've shared similar
 
01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
experiences in the past as the previous
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
speaker where those groups were um from
 
01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
the ground up that were born out of
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
wanting to try to increase positive
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
communication between families who have
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and the
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
school district um multiple districts
 
01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
those were chosen in very different ways
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
um all of the groups that I worked with
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
during my time as a special ed director
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
prior to my time at the school boards
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
Association also had an outside agency
 
01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
or Association that facilitated those
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
groups so that there was some
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
equalizing um person either from the
 
01:26:47.550 --> 01:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
parent Information Center New Hampshire
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
family voices does a wonderful job of
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
helping facilitate those groups um and
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
those the role of the person from those
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
agencies was really to help the group
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
understand and decide how they were
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to make decisions um how they were
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to incorporate new members make
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
sure there were some processes in place
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
to protect student privacy things like
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
that um those groups also the members of
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
those groups offer to become Vol uh
 
01:27:14.189 --> 01:27:14.199 align:start position:0%
mentors to families who are new to the
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
district or new to the special education
 
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
process in the district so that those
 
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
people had additional roles the people
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that served on those committees all did
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
that as a volunteer um they were thought
 
01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
out in many different ways and the
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
makeup of those committees was very um
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
personalized depending on the district
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
in which those groups happened um so we
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest potentially the
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
consideration of having some other um
 
01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
training aspect for the group if these
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
were to go forward which we feel is a
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
very positive um aspect of making sure
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
that the group is functioning I think
 
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard in other uh testimony on
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
bills not this particular Bill about
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
large groups of people trying to
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate some of these conversations
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
and some of the challenges that can come
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
along with that so uh we also would just
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
want to be mindful of the fact that
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
school boards by Design are limited as
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
to what they can and cannot know in
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
terms of students with disabilities in
 
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:10.280 align:start position:0%
the district that is very intentional
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the school board is
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
also the entity that is uh involved in
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
student discipline hearings manifest
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
education hardship perhaps some other
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
types of hearings or information down
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
the road in terms of students with
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities in their District um um
 
01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.669 align:start position:0%
disabilities in their District um um
having

01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
them uh choose members of this committee
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
and whatever information would be
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
provided to the school board as a result
 
01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
of that application process could be of
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
concern I think when Schoolboard members
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
then perhaps down the line need to be
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
involved with these families in a
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
different manner um we would want to be
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
really cautious about uh the fact that
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
while we understand that these meetings
 
01:28:51.229 --> 01:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
would be public um and open to the
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
public and that there are minutes uh
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
according to this bill that are being
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
taken that are also going to be made
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
public to ensure somehow that those
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
meetings are again um there's some
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
training and facilitation around what it
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
means to have a public meeting with
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
parents of PE people with disabil or
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities things that
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
could be potentially shared at those
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
meetings how that would be um you know
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
captured in a way that would make sure
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
that there's not even parents or
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
students who are not part of that
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
committee that those cases are not being
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
discussed at the public meeting or how
 
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
are those being recorded in the minutes
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
to just be really cautious about all of
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
that and make sure that there's some
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
ways to do that um we also just want to
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that there are a
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
number of school districts in the state
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
that do not operate a school at least 10
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
I think at this point um so I'm not sure
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
they would definitely not have a PTO I
 
01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe nor would they have enough
 
01:29:45.790 --> 01:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
parents to make this group up uh this
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
bill is very specific about the fact
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
that it's for every school district so I
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
think that would need to be addressed in
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
terms of districts that don't operate a
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
school um um or how you would protect
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
against student and family privacy in
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
those situations just be mindful but uh
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
we certainly want to be clear that um
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
increasing positive communication
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
between families of students with
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the school district is
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
something that we greatly support uh
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
this has been very successful in other
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh districts that have done this on
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
their own there are a number of them uh
 
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee to sort of
 
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
reach out to your local school districts
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
and find out if you do have a family
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
school partnership team or some other uh
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
version of a special ed advisory
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
committee in your District because many
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
many districts do this already happy to
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions representative Murray
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I do have two
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
small questions so I'll I'll I'll ask
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
them in uh the first question I think
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
you and the previous speaker had talked
 
01:30:45.109 --> 01:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
about training in some mechanism would
 
01:30:46.590 --> 01:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
this be an outside organization that
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
would offer this at new charge or would
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
this be a charge to the Local District
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
how do you envision that training or
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
where where would that come from thank
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
think uh it depends on the district um
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
and what the needs are of the district
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
so there's been many occasions where
 
01:31:03.629 --> 01:31:03.639 align:start position:0%
there are broad trainings that would be
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
offered across the state and different
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
districts in regards to parental rights
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
and special education um the IEP process
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
the evaluation process things like that
 
01:31:13.629 --> 01:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
that are really General trainings there
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
are districts who might um as a result
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
of having this kind of group Identify
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
some areas of need in their District
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
such as um you know uh how to have a
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
collaborative team meeting what to do if
 
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
you get stuck as a team uh what are some
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
other area agencies that are available
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
to support families in your area those
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of trainings are really um built
 
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
from that committee making a decision
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
about what are the needs of the district
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
and then there are times where maybe you
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
have a district expert so to speak who
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
could present that alongside a parent or
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps you're seeking out somebody to
 
01:31:49.149 --> 01:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
come in and do that training um New
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire family voices in the past has
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
done trainings for districts on
 
01:31:55.229 --> 01:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
transition services for students who are
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh aging out of special education
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
post-secondary options post-secondary
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
planning we've done person- centered
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
planning we have done uh the right
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
question training in terms of helping
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
teams ask the right questions to get to
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
a resolve on something so it just really
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
depends on what the needs are of your
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
District um also different districts
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
depending on what's happening in their
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
district with initiatives like science
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
of reading for example um large school
 
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
district and and family training on what
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
is the science of reading how does that
 
01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
work in your District um you know those
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
some sort of the district initiatives
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
that are happening that would impact
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
both families with students with
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities and families without and a
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
Fallout and then my other question was
 
01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
around those smaller or there's 10
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
districts uh roughly that you mentioned
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
and also um those places where like doe
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
may already suppress data due to small
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
numbers or things like that so I I'm
 
01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
curious to uh understand how this
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
specific piece of legislation might
 
01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
impact that thank you for the question
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
um again I think the underlying premise
 
01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:02.119 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to make sure that
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
parents of and students with
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities have a voice at the table
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
with some of the things that they see
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
that are of concern in their District if
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
there are parents in those tiny
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
districts that have those
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
concerns the way this bill reads there
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
has there would have to be a council at
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
every single District I don't know if
 
01:33:22.590 --> 01:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
those families get incorporated into the
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
districts where they're students are
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
attending school perhaps or so I don't I
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
don't know how that would work um it's
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
just not addressed in the bill currently
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
if there's you know some amendments we'd
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
be happy to look at them and make sure
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
that that concern is addressed any other
 
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
questions say none thank you very much
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
that being the end I'm going to close
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll move on to the next bill
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
on the uh schedule for day today which
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%

studies in public schools to include the
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire I'm here in support of
 
01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and um reason is because I
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
asked around and many New Hampshire
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
students are unaware of how people with
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities have been subjected to mass
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%

01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
other acts intended to harm them as a
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
group in Nazi Germany people with
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities were the first group
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
targeted for
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
extermination um they started with
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
murdering children with disabilities and
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
based on their success um and and the
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
how they learned to be more efficient
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
with killing those children they moved
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
on to CH killing children and adults um
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
using poison gas and what they called

Holocaust Memorial Day celebration
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
ceremony I'm sorry um it became the
 
01:37:13.149 --> 01:37:13.159 align:start position:0%
model for the mass murder that would
 
01:37:16.390 --> 01:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
follow in the Nazi extermination camps
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
the Nazis murdered an estimated 275,000
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities but they are
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
considered to be the Holocaust forgotten

considered to be the Holocaust forgotten
victims

01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony I included a
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
horrifying story from a documentary
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
about one of the killing centers where
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
the workers celebrated um with beer wine
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
and cheese they essentially had a party
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
when the 10,000th person with a
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
disability was gassed to death I've also
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
included some examples with citations I
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
always I love citations um of other
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
attempts to harm or destroy people with
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities as a group um Ellie wiisel
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
wrote In his book Knight to forget the
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
dead would be akin to killing them a
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
second time people with disabilities who
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
were murdered during the Holocaust and
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
other genocides have been overlooked for
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
too long please recommend this bill
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass so they are no longer
 
01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:08.960 align:start position:0%

conversation right now as part of the
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
program from my understanding from
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
talking to students they're just silent
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%

to bring up house bills 76 FN relative
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
to tracking special education complaints
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
um we have uh uh two people from the
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
Department who have um have filled in a
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
card that's the only other uh testimony
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
that I see um would uh attorney Fenton
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
and Rebecca fet like to come up that you
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
can come up jointly uh or uh
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Rebecca fette Dana
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
Fenton just stepped out of the um room
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
quickly so she should be right back I am
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
the um administrator over the Bureau of
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
special education support at the
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um we did want
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
to um just point out a few things that
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
um might be of concern with the bill um
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
one of them was naming the school
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
district while we have lots of school
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
districts that are very small and have a
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
small number of students with
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities ities if we were to post
 
01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
some of those districts it could be
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
considered personally identifiable
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
information um so it would be on line 28
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
it says that we would post the name of
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
the school district I think that's the
 
01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.910 align:start position:0%
the school district I think that's the
right

01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
one and so that would be of concern for
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
some of those smaller districts um we
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
understand if it's a bigger District we
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
could definitely post them and we
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
currently do Post complaints they have
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
been um starting to post some of those
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
but our concern would be if it's a
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
really small District they only have
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
about five special ed students
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
um it might be personally identifiable
 
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
for for that District um the other other
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
concern was just that um turning around
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
a complaint within 30 days we would need
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
to redact everything and get everything
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
um make sure that there was no
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information and
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
it just might be a tight turnaround time
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
if it's just 30 days but those were the
 
01:42:46.750 --> 01:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
only two um things we do currently track
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
them through an Excel sheet and we also
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
do um Miss Fenton's office also does
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
post them online currently
 
01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions yes
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Thank You chair
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so do
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
you you think you do most of this
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
already um there are some data points
 
01:43:08.070 --> 01:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we probably don't post I would have
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
to confirm with um attorney Fenton just
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
for the data points but um I think I we
 
01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
do keep track of the date of the
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
complaint was filed the contact
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
information the respondents information
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe we track the name
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
of the law firm currently um we do have
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
a summary of the allegations we do keep
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
track of the dates for the complaint
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
process and the status of updates
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the process and the outcome
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
of the complaint so we do all of those
 
01:43:37.149 --> 01:43:37.159 align:start position:0%
things I think um the one thing that I'm
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
not sure that we keep track of is the
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
law firm for the school
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
district followup yes so is it not easy
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
to find or is there a is it easily
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
findable on the Department's website
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's just they just started posting them
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
within the last probably 3 to four
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
months okay thank you you're
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Bon thank you Mr
 
01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm assuming that um this bill
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
probably has arisen from some of the U
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
um recommendations from the audit on the
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
U the process which I losing my my
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
thought here um so on to this I I see
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
that there these these probably came out
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations some of these
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
here but I'm just
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
questioning why would why would the law
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
firm be an important thing to track you
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
would have to um thank you for the
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
question represent bbon you would have
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
to ask the um sponsor of the bill I'm
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure okay and just to
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
clarify you are concerned with some of
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
the Privacy implications by putting some
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
of that information out here y
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
specifically the smaller districts and
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
the district name yes thank you yep
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
R Mur uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:44:57.870 --> 01:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I just
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear because on the top
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
portion where it um lays out sort of the
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
types of data that's that are being
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
tracked on line eight it does say the
 
01:45:08.589 --> 01:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
complaintants contact information but
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
then further down below in section two
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
the complaintant information is not
 
01:45:15.790 --> 01:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
there so is that being shared out the
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
actual name of the complaintant as I
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
read it no um it looks like just this
 
01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
information starting on line 24 would be
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
what is shared out to the public thank
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%

i000 hi
 
01:46:55.790 --> 01:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so my question is the department has
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
U voiced some concerns uh with the with
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and do you share those concerns
 
01:47:02.910 --> 01:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
and are there other concerns that you
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill well I I agree with the issues that
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
were identified I don't like the term um
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
having some concerns because as I have
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
explained previously the department is
 
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
here to provide technical assistance to
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
identify areas of concern um but we
 
01:47:28.669 --> 01:47:28.679 align:start position:0%
don't support or oppose bills as you
 
01:47:28.679 --> 01:47:29.390 align:start position:0%
don't support or oppose bills as you
well

01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
know um I'm sure that uh my colleague
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
covered that currently the department
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
and special ed um special ed complaints
 
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
we do redact the decision letters and we
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
have posted those on our website that
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
was found in the audit last year and so
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
we have um taken steps to rectify that
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
audit finding and so I think currently
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
on our website you can find the letters
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
currently that have been issued in
 
01:47:57.520 --> 01:47:59.070 align:start position:0%
currently that have been issued in
25

01:47:59.070 --> 01:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
2024 and
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
2023 and we anticipate that the letters
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
that were issued in 2022 will be on our
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
website uh as of mid-February so give or
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
take a couple of weeks there but we are
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
currently in the practice of in the
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
process rather of posting those those
 
01:48:16.639 --> 01:48:18.510 align:start position:0%
process rather of posting those those
letters

01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
letters
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer any technical
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
question questions as it relates to this
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill as currently
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
drafted representative Cornell thank you
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question and
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
I know it's not your bill but would you
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
see any reason why the name of the law
 
01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.109 align:start position:0%
see any reason why the name of the law
firm

01:48:38.109 --> 01:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
firm
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
would provide any
 
01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I think
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's probably a question better posed
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor however uh I would guess
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
and this is pure speculation which is
 
01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
never a safe area to go into on public
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
testimony but I think the reality is
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
this there's this is a small state and
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are very few law firms that
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
represent school districts and there
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
could be people that find that
 
01:49:24.589 --> 01:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
information just helpful in terms
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
of what districts are getting support
 
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
from from what uh Law Firm so I can see
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
why someone might be interested in that
 
01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:36.159 align:start position:0%
information um a
 
01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
anecdotally people will often ask the
 
01:49:40.270 --> 01:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
department what law firm would you
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
recommend is there an attorney you would
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
recommend and so I think uh and to be
 
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
clear we do not provide that information
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
we are a state agency we cannot
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
recommend certain attorneys but I can
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
just tell you um as an attorney and as a
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
citizen and sometimes from the outside
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
looking in if you're not familiar with
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
lawyers it can be a little daunting so
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
knowing what firms represent what
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
districts I can see why someone might be
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
interested in that anything further than
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
that and again that's pure speculation
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
on my part um I would redirect your
 
01:50:16.589 --> 01:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
question to the sponsor thank you but I
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you further
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%

01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%

01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%

01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%

01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%

partment you may have some information
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
for the deal for the constituency of all
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
of us to have this impact well thank you
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
um in terms of technical
 
01:51:37.030 --> 01:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
advisories we are always willing as an
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
agency to put out air to put out
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
advisories to address areas of concern
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
that people are raising um I have not
 
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
heard nor have I received a directive to
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
put out a a technical advisory for that
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
particular area but obviously as a state
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
agency We Stand ready to provide that
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
information so I'm happy to have that
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
conversation with the commissioner and
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
see if if drafting a technical advisory
 
01:52:04.589 --> 01:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate um as you know on
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
our website we have numerous technical
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
advisories about wide variety of
 
01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
subjects so that is not an area that we
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
are uh we shy away from at all it is
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
however I will say a process so I always
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
just tell people technical advisories
 
01:52:23.189 --> 01:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
takes take time typically I draft them
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
or someone else in the department drafts
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
them and then they go through a revision
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
process uh so it's unfortunately not
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
something that we can turn around in a
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
day or two but that is an area that we
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
take a lot of pride in um in issuing
 
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
those technical advisory so I'm happy to
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
have that
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
conversation thank follow thank you um
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe I use that as a two formal of
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
a a term and I appreciate the fact that
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
you people do those and get them out
 
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
there in the public uh but really just
 
01:52:54.030 --> 01:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
something to the the districts out there
 
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
now who are I mean they just
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
significantly concerned is at least the
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
something to give me direction before
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
pending technical advisor because
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
they're concerned and nervous that's all
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that feedback I will
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
happily talk to the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
and commissioner about that and see what
 
01:53:12.069 --> 01:53:12.079 align:start position:0%

01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
that one of my colleagues has moved up I
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's in response to this

Department of Education we finally

01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um regarding the

out to all of the school leaders to give

them background information and to

federal order that was placed yesterday
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%

bill for and it would not it would just
 
01:55:37.870 --> 01:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
be illegal anyway for context in

01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
mandates are very expensive to
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
administer and the Ida legislation
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
originally proposed funding at
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
40% however Congress has
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
only appropriated a fraction of the
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
promised funding resulting in an
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate and shifts the costs
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%

01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:02.440 align:start position:0%

each state compiles specific data and
 
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.440 align:start position:0%

data what information is currently
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
collected and reported as required by
 
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
this bill for example the reporting that
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
is already in progress and would be um
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
available through this bill include
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
basic statistics about the number of
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
students with IEP in section 4 504 plans
 
01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
and progress the number of special
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
education Personnel in the district and
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
total costs costs for contracted

number of special education dispute

resolution cases and total revenue
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
received for special education so why is
 
01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
this bill necessary well some school
 
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
school districts could do a good job in
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
providing this data at the local level
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
not all school districts provide this
 
01:59:02.669 --> 01:59:02.679 align:start position:0%
important information about special
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
education to school boards and
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers this Common Sense bill would
 
01:59:11.310 --> 01:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
ensure uniformity and transparency about
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
special education expenditures that are
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
easily accessible to the
 
01:59:20.069 --> 01:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
public you may ask will this bill
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
increase administrative burd
 
01:59:25.229 --> 01:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
no because the reporting requirements
 
01:59:28.109 --> 01:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
outlined in this bill are already
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
mandated by federal and state laws to
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
comply with the idea
 
01:59:37.149 --> 01:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions while researching this bill I
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
had phone conversations with our New
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education commissioner
 
01:59:45.069 --> 01:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
regarding overall State reporting
 
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
requirements I discussed reporting
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
details with the uh with several in the
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh special educ ation office and had
 
01:59:57.069 --> 01:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
phone conversations with Washington DC
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
based Ida administers administrators to
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
discuss the Ida program and federal
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
reporting guidelines no issues or
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
concerns with the parameters of this
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
bill were raised during these
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
discussions and I did this because I am
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
not an expert in this area and I wanted
 
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the parameters of the
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill um were correct
 
02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
as special education costs continue to
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
escalate access to current information
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
will be crucial for school boards and
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to accurately assess budget
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
and make difficult decisions therefore I
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
request ought to pass for this Common
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
Sense Bill thank you thank you and um
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
when we're finished if if you would pass
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
your written testimony up through the um
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
through the membership of course clerk
 
02:00:56.990 --> 02:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
any questions for the sponsor
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
no represent bbon thank you Mr chair and
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um as
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
you've already indicated you said the
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
this information is already being
 
02:01:10.750 --> 02:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
collected and I believe posted on
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not all school districts
 
02:01:16.109 --> 02:01:16.119 align:start position:0%
post this information I couldn't get it
 
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
for my school
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
district followup please followup um
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
but but you just said it was required
 
02:01:27.629 --> 02:01:27.639 align:start position:0%
it's required at the to it's the
 
02:01:30.430 --> 02:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
information is collected and required at
 
02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
the state and federal level so this bill
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
would take that data and uh make it
 
02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
available to school boards and more
 
02:01:41.750 --> 02:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
importantly post it on a school district
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
website or have this information
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
accessible to taxpayers so that that's
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
where the disconnect is we have the data
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to make it more access
 
02:01:53.950 --> 02:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
because for example in my school
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.189 --> 02:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
data thank you we maray thank you Mr
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
chair and I think maybe this might be a
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
question for the Department perhaps then
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Bon's
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
question um so I don't know if if it's
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
not you then then let me know um I did I
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
I immediately asked whether or not this
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
this information is already reported to
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and by any
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
one of new IE portals of of air are
 
02:02:26.350 --> 02:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
available to be viewed by the districts
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
and also then
 
02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
transferred by the districts to to their
 
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
information and reports that the
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
district communicates with one another
 
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
so that's question one and then uh with
 
02:02:38.069 --> 02:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
regard it seems like you're creating an
 
02:02:39.709 --> 02:02:39.719 align:start position:0%
additional re if I'm understanding
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
correctly a requirement for the district
 
02:02:45.149 --> 02:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
to post this data and is there any
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
concern with um again those smaller
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
districts where suppressions or
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
identifiable information would
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
potentially be there because the the
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
size of the the sample size of those
 
02:02:59.030 --> 02:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
available for 504s are IEP plant is
 
02:03:01.950 --> 02:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
under 11 or something like that and this
 
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
bill is requiring that information to be
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
shared on the district website right
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
right there is no identifiable
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
information um in the bill there's no
 
02:03:14.069 --> 02:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
identifiable information and although
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
the um information may be available on
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
various uh State websites the problem is
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
is it's just very difficult for
 
02:03:27.390 --> 02:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to try to piece all of it
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
together so this is just a simple report
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
that is showing taxpayers school boards
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
you know where where this data a
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
snapshot of this data in a very simple
 
02:03:45.149 --> 02:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
um EAS uh easy Toof find
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
format follow up thank you Mr share uh
 
02:03:50.310 --> 02:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
my question isn't necessarily
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
identifiable information say my my
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
question is about the sample size of
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
individuals who who would receive
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
services are under that threshold and
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
then being required to be posted on the
 
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
district website regardless of what
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
other information may be redacted I'm
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
talking about sheer sample size of
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
participants so if I understand your
 
02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
question I'll certainly defer um so if
 
02:04:18.549 --> 02:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
it's a small school district and there's
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
two students with IEPs
 
02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
the information would reflect the two
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
that the number two students not
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
anything specifically identifiable for
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
them so then we could look at you know
 
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
different um parameters to understand
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
what the cost of special education is
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
District represent bbon uh thank you Mr
 
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:04:53.229 --> 02:04:53.239 align:start position:0%
question on line 23 of first page you
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
are requesting the number of new special
 
02:04:59.390 --> 02:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
education complaints and number 24 the
 
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
number of current alternative dispute
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
resolution cases uh going down again uh
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
you want legal costs um um I just
 
02:05:14.350 --> 02:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in my district you're talking
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
about cases that do only involve one or
 
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
two students so even if you're not
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
personally identifying them
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
directly they're in the community and
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
you're actually putting that information
 
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
out there and it could cause a lot of
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
um disrupt I mean divisiveness in terms
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
of parents against parents in terms of
 
02:05:41.229 --> 02:05:41.239 align:start position:0%
whose child is taking up all the money
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
for special ed
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
services do you I guess my question is
 
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
do you do you see it that way no of
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
course we're not trying to cause any um
 
02:05:54.189 --> 02:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
concerns or issues within the district
 
02:05:57.310 --> 02:05:57.320 align:start position:0%
but legal expenses are continuing to
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
escalate and that is a part of the
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
overall special education funding so for
 
02:06:06.549 --> 02:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
example when we see our costs escalating
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
year-over-year and these these programs
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
are mandated at a federal and state
 
02:06:15.629 --> 02:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
level um taxpayers and school boards
 
02:06:18.189 --> 02:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
just need to understand where that
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
increased funding is is um required so
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
is it additional Services because we
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
have additional students that are
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
participating or is it these escalating
 
02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
Leal fees that are um utilizing a lot of
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
these precious resources and I think
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
that is important information for you
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
know School boards and taxpayers to
 
02:06:45.109 --> 02:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
balance thank you uh if I may ask a
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
clarification question so are you
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the legal fees that the
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
districts are seeing and the increased
 
02:06:58.270 --> 02:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
ones are entirely from Special Services
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
students as opposed to contract
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
resolution disputes or negotiations or
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
other any of the Myriad of other areas
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
where School boards May reach out to
 
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
their attorneys for guidance such as if
 
02:07:14.510 --> 02:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
there's a federal cut to their food
 
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
funding and needing to find guidance for
 
02:07:18.189 --> 02:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
how to make sure that they can continue
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
to feed their children not not for this
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
specific bill it really is trying to
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
look at the totality of special
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
education um costs and of course
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
transportation and legal fees have
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed over the past few years so
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's to get a better clarification on
 
02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
it's to get a better clarification on
those

02:07:38.390 --> 02:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
areas repesent Murray thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and thank you
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question I there are
 
02:07:48.990 --> 02:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
census numbers change very frequently
 
02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
and depending on the student body so I'm
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
a again concerned a little bit do or do
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
you share the same concern that I have
 
02:07:57.589 --> 02:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
with potentially identifying a learner
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
or a new Community member uh by the
 
02:08:02.589 --> 02:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
Cadence in which you are requesting this
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
information uh and and some of the ways
 
02:08:06.189 --> 02:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
that you're asking it to be enumerated
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
such as quote new students to the
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
district if we I personally think that
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
it's information that is very important
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
to explain to taxpayers where they're
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
obviously property taxes are going to uh
 
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
pay for a lot of these services and we
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
have seen especially in my town a
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase in our property taxes
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to figure out you know
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
where is this additional spending and um
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately one area that um doesn't
 
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
get we don't have a lot of data for is
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
in the growing area of special ed we
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
know the bottom line numbers that are
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
increased ing but I think it's important
 
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
for taxpayers to know what you know what
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
portion and what different um areas are
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
in that growth area so that we could you
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
know they can make decisions about how
 
02:09:09.750 --> 02:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
to balance out their school budgets repr
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman quelli good
 
02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for bringing this
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
forward uh I let fall I may on
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bon's commentary on
 
02:09:22.109 --> 02:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
sections three this information that's
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
public record um this public document
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that the reason this
 
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
bill is here is because your
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent wouldn't give you that
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
information there are many different
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
school districts um in the state of New
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that don't provide this
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
information readily in one Consolidated
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
format to school districts and again
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
more uh importantly to the average
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer that you know would just like
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
to see okay where you know what what is
 
02:09:55.470 --> 02:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
the school spending and I just want to
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
be able to have that breakdown
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
understand it would be very difficult to
 
02:10:02.589 --> 02:10:02.599 align:start position:0%
find some of the it was difficult for me
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
to find some of this information follow
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
just just clarification I think I heard
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
you saying your testimon because you
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it from your school
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
district as an example okay thank you
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
and just the last part if I may the the
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
other ones in hi j k whatever those
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
numbers are on those letters that is all
 
02:10:19.950 --> 02:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
information that would be dialogue
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
during the school budget process and
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
your school board would be asking the
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
special a director what's his cost
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
what's that cost and and that's a public
 
02:10:29.549 --> 02:10:29.559 align:start position:0%
meeting that people go to and then you
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
want on the budget so it's available it
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
just it seems to me that this bill is um
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps not necessary as it's just
 
02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
duplicating what you could get uh at
 
02:10:40.589 --> 02:10:40.599 align:start position:0%
your own school board by just asking was
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
that a question no yeah was no thank you
 
02:10:46.589 --> 02:10:46.599 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it was a comment okay um see
 
02:10:49.069 --> 02:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
no further uh thank you very much thank
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
you uh the next uh um uh person up is
 
02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.910 align:start position:0%
you uh the next uh um uh person up is

02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr chairman committee members
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Friedman living Bridgewater I
 
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
speak in support of this bill
 
02:11:18.030 --> 02:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
um as already been mentioned special ed
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
is extremely expensive it's like a and
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
getting bigger all the time it's like a
 
02:11:27.069 --> 02:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
big black hole and um and so it's time
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
see you just see like a couple figures
 
02:11:33.149 --> 02:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
on the like we're going through the
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
budget uh we have the deliberative
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
session this coming uh Saturday and so
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
one of the people who's really
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
interested in U asking a lot of
 
02:11:47.030 --> 02:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions U I saw her list I'm leaving
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
the school district we broke away so I
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
can't even participate in it but I'm
 
02:11:53.950 --> 02:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
still in part of the the district so I'm
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
interested anyway she sent a big long
 
02:11:58.950 --> 02:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
list of questions to the superintendent
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
and there were a bunch of them
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
specifically about special ed and it's
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
true other than you just look at a
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
couple figures on a spreadsheet you're
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
not really getting much detail how many
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
teachers do we have devoted to this how
 
02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
many students um you know you got to
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
know the specifics looking at a few
 
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
figures 1 million 1. 8 million it
 
02:12:23.950 --> 02:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't really mean much other than it's
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
a big figure so she wrote this email to
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and him and the
 
02:12:32.669 --> 02:12:32.679 align:start position:0%
business manager they mentioned we're
 
02:12:34.910 --> 02:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
working on getting the answers to you
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is silly so this to me should be
 
02:12:41.470 --> 02:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
automatically available to the P that's
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
what this bill is about it's all about
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
transparency they've got most of the
 
02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
information right there um and they're
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
just uh so you answer her well then
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
somebody else might ask why not just
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
have it all up on the website or if you
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
don't want the the burden of collecting
 
02:13:02.589 --> 02:13:02.599 align:start position:0%
all that information again put up the
 
02:13:05.470 --> 02:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
reports that they already do which that
 
02:13:07.629 --> 02:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
covers almost everything it doesn't
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%
cover um I think it's h through J or
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
whatever it is about the uh
 
02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
complaints uh
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
denials uh legal expense things like
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
that which there shouldn't be that much
 
02:13:24.350 --> 02:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh but definitely the taxpayers would
 
02:13:26.030 --> 02:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
want to know about and I actually heard
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
about a school district that spent more
 
02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
in legal expense fighting a family that
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
wanted the services they spent more in
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
legal expense than the actual cost of
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
what the services would have been and I
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
think taxpayers would definitely want to
 
02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:44.559 align:start position:0%
know about that so I don't think that
 
02:13:48.189 --> 02:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
part of the things that it's asking for
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be that much extra
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
information most most of it can be done
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
if they don't have time to collect it
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
all over again just uh those reports
 
02:13:58.589 --> 02:13:58.599 align:start position:0%
that they file with the Department of
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
Education just have the superintendent
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
present them to the school board and
 
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
then the then there'll be public
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
information and that's good enough and
 
02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
then you don't have interested uh
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that that want to get to the
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
bottom of things um emailing the
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent they have plenty of other
 
02:14:18.030 --> 02:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
things to do so this should be just put
 
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
it up transparency is a good thing
 
02:14:25.549 --> 02:14:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh what else did yeah it's um I I I say
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's basically a transparency Bill and U
 
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
making things
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
available they're not that they're
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
trying to hide things but people really
 
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
want to know
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh what are we spending and is it
 
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
actually accomplishing anything that's
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
part of the thing too is the results so
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
just spending an endless amount of money
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
even if you find out how your the
 
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:52.559 align:start position:0%
details of it are these making any
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
improvements or should we just continue
 
02:14:57.229 --> 02:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
spend more and more what are the results
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's part of it too is are you
 
02:15:02.669 --> 02:15:02.679 align:start position:0%
accomplishing anything so I think um you
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
really can't go wrong with more
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
transparency and that's why I support
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you
 
02:15:10.109 --> 02:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
much for being here thank you uh Karen
 
02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:21.750 align:start position:0%
much for being here thank you uh Karen

02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
good morning I had to look at the clock
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
to see if it was still morning I'm Karen
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center where the
 
02:15:30.470 --> 02:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
state's protection and advocacy system
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
for students and actually all
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who experience disability
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
and we do receive a lot of inquiries
 
02:15:38.549 --> 02:15:38.559 align:start position:0%
from parents of students with
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities so I'm here to um testify
 
02:15:44.669 --> 02:15:44.679 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this spill because I
 
02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:47.559 align:start position:0%
have some very serious concerns about it
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
um two and in and and I don't know which
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
is most important so you'll either one
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
of them one I think it's patently
 
02:15:56.109 --> 02:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
illegal I think it would violate federal
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
law because um as particularly in small
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
towns when you're looking at some of the
 
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
um data that would need to be released
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
it would inadvertently identify students
 
02:16:13.709 --> 02:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
and we both under idea and furpa um
 
02:16:15.910 --> 02:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
there are protections for student
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and prohibitions against
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
releasing records that would either
 
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
intentionally or unintentionally reveal
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
students identity so that is a big
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
concern um and I don't know that we want
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
to put our federal um idea money at risk
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
by passing a law that you know would
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
contradict what the Federal Law requires
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of protection protecting
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
confidentiality secondly um from a you
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
know putting the law aside even if it
 
02:16:48.750 --> 02:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem that we'd be violating
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
federal law I have con concerns about
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
the impact of the release of information
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
that could easily be um trained so that
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
a parent or someone in the community
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
could identify who's costing what and
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're our schools are established to
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
educate all children right children with
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities children without
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the way that our
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
funding system works which is imperfect
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
you all have another committee dealing
 
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
with that doesn't distinguish between um
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know what doesn't doesn't well it
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
hasn't looked at what it costs to
 
02:17:27.070 --> 02:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
educate a particular child um with a
 
02:17:30.429 --> 02:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
disability or scrutinize how much it
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
costs to identify them and in terms of
 
02:17:34.349 --> 02:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
the federal funding mechanism we wish
 
02:17:37.389 --> 02:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
the federal government contributed more
 
02:17:39.389 --> 02:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
we the amount that New Hampshire
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
receives is based on a child count and I
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
think the think the thinking behind that
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
is is that well it doesn't all come out
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the wash it should all come out in
 
02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
the wash but some students will um it'll
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
be less expensive and some it'll be more
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
but basically we're charged with
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
educating all students and ensuring that
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
all students have available to them a
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
free and appropriate public education
 
02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
and I understand that it's difficult as
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer to look at your property tax
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
bill and your school Bill and see those
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
bills going up I'm a property owner I
 
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
see those bills um but I think we need
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
to look at you know how what what can we
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
do where to address education and
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
education funding in a way that um
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
recognizes Our obligation to educate
 
02:18:26.910 --> 02:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
everyone and doesn't f divisiveness
 
02:18:29.309 --> 02:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
among our neighbors our friends our kids
 
02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
peers and their families so for all
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
those reasons I um highly hope that you
 
02:18:38.429 --> 02:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
will recommend that this ought to be
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
determined and expedient to legislate
 
02:18:42.549 --> 02:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
you might have any
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent
 
02:18:53.150 --> 02:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
Morris good rson Mor go ahead I just had
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
a question in relation to where on here
 
02:18:57.190 --> 02:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
um would it breach federal law just so I
 
02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
can kind of idea so the first thing to
 
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
know is that under um so you know that
 
02:19:05.070 --> 02:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
under idea and under fura there are
 
02:19:07.870 --> 02:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
protections against the disclosure of
 
02:19:10.190 --> 02:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
per student identifying information
 
02:19:12.629 --> 02:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
correct um and so and the way that
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's defined includes information that
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
would not just that would have like a
 
02:19:19.669 --> 02:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
name and a student ID number but I'm
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
just reading from idea for for example a
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
list of personal characteristics or
 
02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
other information that would make it
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
possible to identify the child with
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable certainty right so that's an
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
example under idea these are the kids
 
02:19:33.629 --> 02:19:33.639 align:start position:0%
were talking about so now if you look at
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
the bill um things like I'm on
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
page one I guess we one so I'm looking
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
at this list from the quarterly report
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
the cost of contracted services within
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
the district by type of service and
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
number of students receiving such
 
02:19:51.990 --> 02:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
contracted services so in a small town
 
02:19:54.190 --> 02:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be difficult to figure out
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
like if you see a certain bus going by
 
02:19:58.030 --> 02:19:58.040 align:start position:0%
for example and you can see the kids in
 
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
the bus who's riding that bus um who are
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
the students the number of so there's
 
02:20:04.830 --> 02:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
actually a transportation one right
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
after that um or you might know that a
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
student is blind and requires certain
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
interventions but how many blind
 
02:20:13.230 --> 02:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
students are there going to be in a
 
02:20:15.990 --> 02:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
district so if you got a report that
 
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
included you know services for the blind
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
from a particular you know Ider that's
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
known to serve blind children then you
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
would know how much it's costing and it
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
would identify that particular child um
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
same with you know students who are in
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
extended school year depending how big
 
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
the school is that could reveal um
 
02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
enough information to know who the kids
 
02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
are um so those are just a few examples
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and some of this information like the
 
02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
aggregate information that is provided
 
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education is
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
available under with a 91a request our
 
02:20:55.190 --> 02:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
right to no law um one thing to consider
 
02:20:56.510 --> 02:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
would be if the department of I'm sure
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education people are
 
02:21:00.150 --> 02:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
going to throw daggers at me but since
 
02:21:02.790 --> 02:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
they are please don't they have the you
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
know since they are the repository for
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
all this information and they have a
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
website that and they post a lot of data
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
already um perhaps that would be
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
something that they could post because
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're already posting a lot of data
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
around um the programs they operate and
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
school and you know measured success in
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
education assessments and things like
 
02:21:26.670 --> 02:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
that so that might be a way to get that
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
information um I think information
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
around attorney's fees also might be
 
02:21:32.349 --> 02:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
something not that the Department of
 
02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
Education would have but that individual
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
districts could make available I mean
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
they might have to under our right to no
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
law thank you represent of
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:21:47.469 --> 02:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so for me
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
transparency equals accountability
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and no one can have details due to
 
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
privacy not the Schoolboard not the
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers my concern is if not this bill
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
then what what do you suggest that we do
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
because these folks I agree we educate
 
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
every child I have no problem with that
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
but these families are choosing to use
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
public tax dollars this is not private
 
02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
insurance they're utilizing every single
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
other budget line the school board and
 
02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
the public has an opportunity to go
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
through and I know as a school board
 
02:22:23.150 --> 02:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
member there were times when I would
 
02:22:25.389 --> 02:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
push back on budget lines for special
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
education and first of all people are
 
02:22:29.790 --> 02:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
angry you're ostracized you're evil if
 
02:22:32.030 --> 02:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
you question it no I'm just trying to do
 
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
right by that student and the taxpayer
 
02:22:35.309 --> 02:22:35.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's something better that
 
02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
we can do for that student that no one
 
02:22:38.510 --> 02:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
is thinking of it just it's viewed as
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
this big black hole so what do you
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
suggest that we do just to make it
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
better and to make it transparent well I
 
02:22:48.190 --> 02:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
think some things just may not be able
 
02:22:49.950 --> 02:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
to be as transparent as you want them to
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
be and I'm sorry about that I think that
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
like it students records and students
 
02:22:58.590 --> 02:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
services and individualized education
 
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
programs are just that and our Federal
 
02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
Law requires that a lot of that
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
information about a student be kept
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
confidential but we do have laws that
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
Define what an adequate education is for
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
students what a free and appropriate
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
public education is for students with
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities and that they must be
 
02:23:17.870 --> 02:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
educated in the least restrictive
 
02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
environment according to their needs and
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
we have processes that are in place both
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
at the school district level where we
 
02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
have the IEP teams which you're probably
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with and who go through a
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
process to determine what it is a
 
02:23:32.830 --> 02:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
student needs to receive a free
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education we have um
 
02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities for parents to dispute
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
that um and for schools um if there's
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
issues with what a student needs we have
 
02:23:47.950 --> 02:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
um monitoring and oversight by our
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in terms of
 
02:23:51.389 --> 02:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
whether students are getting their needs
 
02:23:54.429 --> 02:23:54.439 align:start position:0%
met appropriately or not and schools are
 
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
facing Financial challenges right we
 
02:23:59.309 --> 02:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
know this so there's not like a built-in
 
02:24:01.790 --> 02:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
incentive for schools to try to spend
 
02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
more money they need to operate within
 
02:24:07.230 --> 02:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
their budgets and budget constraints so
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of factors that
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
can limit and do limit the amount of
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
money that expended for education for
 
02:24:19.710 --> 02:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and um and I
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
think that there are mechanisms in place
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
like Department of Education oversight
 
02:24:28.830 --> 02:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
like the um you know this the the harsh
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
reality that schools have to operate
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
within budgets that's really tough and
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
so I know from our perspective as you
 
02:24:37.750 --> 02:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
know the disability rights Center we end
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
up representing parents who feel that
 
02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
their children are not getting enough
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
right and so um or that they're not
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
being educated in the least restrictive
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
environment and and it is and you know I
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
think schools do their best to make sure
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
they're providing what the student needs
 
02:24:56.510 --> 02:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
within the you know their ability to do
 
02:24:59.309 --> 02:24:59.319 align:start position:0%
this and I think that there but like I
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
said sometimes we more more often than
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
not the cases we get we feel that
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's not enough being um not enough
 
02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
Services thank you representative Marie
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is with
 
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh regard to page one uh lines 13 and 14
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to sort of um tie this
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
back to L or least restrictive
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
environment with respect to par uh
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
enumerate and naming the par
 
02:25:28.750 --> 02:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
Professionals in number and specialist
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
by discipline um is it possible that by
 
02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:33.880 align:start position:0%
um providing the least restrictive
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
environment and then reporting this data
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
we could be also identifying a
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
student um I don't know I suppose it is
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
possible although I know that
 
02:25:49.389 --> 02:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
um as I so I I live in Manchester and I
 
02:25:51.550 --> 02:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
know that it's it's really not very
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
difficult because this they publish a
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
list of all the state all the um city
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
employees on the website and all their
 
02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
titles so it's really super easy to find
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
out like you could find out all of these
 
02:26:04.950 --> 02:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
this information just on their website I
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that every city or town does
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
that but you could get that information
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
and I hadn't thought about whether it
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
would identify a student I guess if you
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
were doing it by school that might um
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
inadvertently do that follow up quickly
 
02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:20.950 align:start position:0%
inadvertently do that follow up quickly
please

02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
and my my other question then is um
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment just
 
02:26:27.309 --> 02:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't always necessarily mean lit
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
mainstream correct oh no no there's a
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
whole under um idea individuals with
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities Education Act there needs
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
to be a range of placements available so
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
um the least restrictive environment
 
02:26:42.750 --> 02:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
would be to be in the general education
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
classroom with your peers with the
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
student PE all the time 100% of the time
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then um next might be that you're
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're pulled out our students pull out
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
like 20% of the time or a little over
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
20% of the time going down to you know
 
02:26:59.269 --> 02:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
maybe the student requires um services
 
02:27:02.070 --> 02:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
that are not you know that like a very
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
small setting that's just not available
 
02:27:05.469 --> 02:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
in the school so there's they might need
 
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
a separate classroom for part of the
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
time it's really an in that's why
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
they're called individualized education
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
programs and so one students um right to
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
a least restrictive environment may not
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
be the same as others but New Hampshire
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
does a really good job actually at
 
02:27:22.269 --> 02:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
making the L share of our students are
 
02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
being educated in our Public
 
02:27:27.389 --> 02:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
Schools represent selig thank you very
 
02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
much and thank you for taking my
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
question just thinking about the process
 
02:27:34.670 --> 02:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
of a student entering into special
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
education services and some capacity um
 
02:27:41.710 --> 02:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
can you characterize the time that that
 
02:27:45.389 --> 02:27:45.399 align:start position:0%
often takes for a family and and and the
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty um I'm just wondering how's
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
that related to our bill if we're saying
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
sorry um if we're saying that we're
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to identify the different costs
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
for all of these different
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
components if if there's a child with a
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
very with with a more complex learning
 
02:28:03.389 --> 02:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
disability or a higher a harder to
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
diagnose disability they may require far
 
02:28:09.550 --> 02:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
more extensive testing than a child who
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
has like you know a very easily
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
identifiable one so wouldn't those
 
02:28:15.950 --> 02:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
things end up Co demonstrating different
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
costs that are going to go into here
 
02:28:19.269 --> 02:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
that are going to further isolate and
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
distinguish the child
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
is there a quick
 
02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
answer I I I think it's possible I don't
 
02:28:28.590 --> 02:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
know I mean the process can be it it
 
02:28:31.190 --> 02:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
really depends on the child the school
 
02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
district I mean there are a lot of
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
factors there are evaluations that need
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
to happen there there's a lot that goes
 
02:28:39.309 --> 02:28:39.319 align:start position:0%
into identifying a student as eligible
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
and identifying what their needs are um
 
02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
yeah because we want to make sure that
 
02:28:45.790 --> 02:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
we're not you know there there are
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
factors we don't want to over identify
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
children we don't want to identify them
 
02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
as having the wrong disabil we want to
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that our programs are tailored
 
02:28:55.950 --> 02:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
to meet their needs thank you quick
 
02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:56.870 align:start position:0%
to meet their needs thank you quick
question

02:28:56.870 --> 02:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
please would you believe that not going
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
to do any what what do you believe I'm
 
02:29:05.710 --> 02:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
sorry that's not a proper question okay
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
question then how I don't know how to
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
word it I was in a district where there
 
02:29:16.910 --> 02:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
was a special bus impacting 12 students
 
02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:17.550 align:start position:0%
was a special bus impacting 12 students
at

02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
$93,000 a year going door too were
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
waking up the students and if they got
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
in the bus quickly to get to school on
 
02:29:26.790 --> 02:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
time they would get
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
dunks and what do you mean Dunkin Donuts
 
02:29:32.670 --> 02:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
and when when I when I had pushed back
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
on special education saying what what do
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
we do I'm sorry I don't see how that
 
02:29:40.110 --> 02:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
applies to this it it was I was just
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the bottom of the
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
transparency because the push back was
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
they could end up at Crotched Mountain
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
if they're not getting to school on time
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
and being transparent okay than thank
 
02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for being here
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
Dunham thank you um I'm sorry if I'm
 
02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
just combobulated I wasn't planning to
 
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
speak so I have I'm GNA have to turn my
 
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
paper around and around to read my my
 
02:30:19.389 --> 02:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
chicken scratching um I am from Bonnie D
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
from marac New Hampshire and I am so
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill um I was hoping
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
when I first read it the smidgeon of
 
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
hope that the purpose was to figure out
 
02:30:31.990 --> 02:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
how special education for children with
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities could be improved how we
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
could identify some best practices what
 
02:30:37.790 --> 02:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
was working and what wasn't working that
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
bubble was quickly burst um when the
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
words budget cost um came up way more
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
often than the words children and
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
students um one of the things was the
 
02:30:53.230 --> 02:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
somebody said the budget um that this
 
02:30:54.590 --> 02:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
information would allow the budget
 
02:30:57.150 --> 02:30:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee to make difficult decisions
 
02:30:59.309 --> 02:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
decisions like whether a child goes to a
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
residential placement whether they get
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
extended school year Services whether
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
they get special Transportation are not
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
made by the budget committee or the
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
school board they're made by the IEP
 
02:31:11.710 --> 02:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
team based on the child's individualized
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
needs and then they're included in the
 
02:31:18.389 --> 02:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
IEP and and other documents so it I kind
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
of had a flashback to when I heard from
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
a school governance Association that had
 
02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
been newly formed and they provided a
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
list of questions which included how can
 
02:31:29.269 --> 02:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
we get out of providing special
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
education what if we refuse federal
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
funds do we still have to educate them
 
02:31:36.190 --> 02:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
how can one of the shouldn't a school
 
02:31:39.550 --> 02:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
board member be on every IEP team um so
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
that they can make decisions and that's
 
02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
not how it works and then it doesn't
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
work that way for a really good reason
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
um there are other problems with the
 
02:31:50.469 --> 02:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
with the bill um
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
one is that it asks to have reports on
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
the number of students with 504 plans
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
making ad adequate progress towards
 
02:31:57.479 --> 02:31:58.230 align:start position:0%
making ad adequate progress towards
their

02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
goals children on 504 plans don't have
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
goals that's what makes them different
 
02:32:06.750 --> 02:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
from IEP it's one of the things um also
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether they're making
 
02:32:09.910 --> 02:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
adequate progress even if they have an
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
IEP um by adequate progress the is the
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
meaning sufficient to achieve the goal
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year or because that's
 
02:32:19.870 --> 02:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
the sufficiency statement that's requ
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
fired in every IEP progress report or
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
what exactly does it mean um the number
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
and cost of students placed outside of
 
02:32:31.590 --> 02:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
the district really easy to to identify
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
kids in many school districts that way
 
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
um there in especially in small school
 
02:32:37.710 --> 02:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
districts aren't a lot of them and then
 
02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
when you get into dispute resolution
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
issues I spoke a couple of years ago to
 
02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
a family who had a child in a wheelchair
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
in a small school district who was
 
02:32:50.070 --> 02:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
filing complaint was planning to file a
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
complaint because the school had
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
redecorated the cafeteria and bought
 
02:32:56.990 --> 02:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
tables that were not accessible for a
 
02:32:59.790 --> 02:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
wheelchair when asked to change that
 
02:33:01.469 --> 02:33:01.479 align:start position:0%
they said it would ruin the Aesthetics
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
of the cafeteria that was the only child
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
in a wheelchair in that little town if
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
if if someone said so a complaint was
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
filed about accessibility um for a child
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
in a wheelchair you know who that child
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
is and that family probably already goes
 
02:33:19.269 --> 02:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
to budget committees having people
 
02:33:21.469 --> 02:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
meetings in Schoolboard meetings having
 
02:33:23.269 --> 02:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
in town meetings having people point to
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
them saying you're the reason our taxes
 
02:33:27.670 --> 02:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
are so high any bill that would further
 
02:33:31.269 --> 02:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
that is just unacceptable to me and I
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
hope would be unacceptable to you as
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
well in terms of um is this is spending
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
all this money accomplishing anything
 
02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that children with disabilities
 
02:33:43.550 --> 02:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
are graduating at pretty high numbers
 
02:33:45.870 --> 02:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire are going out to
 
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
the world of employment competitive paid
 
02:33:49.240 --> 02:33:50.349 align:start position:0%
the world of employment competitive paid
employment

02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:33:52.510 --> 02:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
and are going on to postsecondary
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
education that's the data that will
 
02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
answer that question and that is readily
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
available on the department of
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
education's website through the um
 
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
annual performance report that's it
 
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:05.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you oh
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions repent Murray thank you Mr
 
02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
question with regard to 504 plans um is
 
02:34:14.110 --> 02:34:14.120 align:start position:0%
your understanding that most of them
 
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
revolve around Medical Health needs no
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
or excuse me and
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
was that so medical and health
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions not necessarily related to a
 
02:34:28.830 --> 02:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
specific disability so sometimes a child
 
02:34:30.830 --> 02:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
will have a 504 plan because it's to
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
provide equal access to programs and
 
02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
activities so a child may have a health
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
plan Health needs that are addressed to
 
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
a 504 plan sometimes a child who has
 
02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
attention deficit disorder just needs a
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
few accommodations so that they can have
 
02:34:47.510 --> 02:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
that same opportunity they need
 
02:34:49.110 --> 02:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
preferential seating they need to take
 
02:34:51.510 --> 02:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
tests in quiet room um and so it's not
 
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
so much a medical issue it's an access
 
02:34:55.830 --> 02:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
issue having a special bus for a child
 
02:34:57.790 --> 02:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
who uses a wheelchair to get to school
 
02:34:59.230 --> 02:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
because they can't get on the regular
 
02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
bus that's something that would be in a
 
02:35:04.030 --> 02:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
504 plan if that child didn't also need
 
02:35:06.269 --> 02:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
special education services thank you
 
02:35:08.030 --> 02:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying thank you um
 
02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay and we have one
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
more uh person uh Kristen
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
manami uh the office of special
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
education Advocate thank you for being
 
02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:21.190 align:start position:0%
education Advocate thank you for being
here

02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
thank you good
 
02:35:25.590 --> 02:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
morning um as representative cordelli
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
said I'm Kristen monani with the New
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Office of the advocate for
 
02:35:33.269 --> 02:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
special education um I am testifying in
 
02:35:35.269 --> 02:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and uh much of
 
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
what I would say would reiterate what
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
both um Miss Dunham and uh Miss
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg have already testified too so
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
I'll try not to repeat all of that
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
um I I think that cost of special
 
02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
education are definitely a very Salient
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
issue unfortunately um our local
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
Education Agency representatives are are
 
02:35:59.030 --> 02:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
feeling themselves constantly
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
constrained by this so I want to
 
02:36:02.429 --> 02:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
emphasize that it it is not that this is
 
02:36:04.670 --> 02:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
not on the minds of those in the school
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
district there are a lot of trade-offs
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're aware of that end up being made
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
in the budget between you know if we
 
02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
have to go down this path and have these
 
02:36:14.269 --> 02:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
additional costs for special ed it has
 
02:36:16.150 --> 02:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
to come from somewhere but I think this
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
is a a question more appropriately dealt
 
02:36:20.269 --> 02:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
with um even I think tomorrow there are
 
02:36:22.429 --> 02:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
a couple of bills being heard on special
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
education costs um adequacy funding and
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
I hope to be here to talk specifically
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
to costs um this does definitively um
 
02:36:35.269 --> 02:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
have numerous ways to identify students
 
02:36:37.389 --> 02:36:37.399 align:start position:0%
um couple of examples um when we talk
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
about out placements there are fewer
 
02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
than 400 students probably in that
 
02:36:44.230 --> 02:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
category in the state um many of our
 
02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
districts would have one or zero and um
 
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
I I was recently involved in a process
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearing and had the opportunity to find
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
out that some of our larger districts
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
have actually very small numbers of
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
outplay students so so 100% personal
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
identifiable and these are very high
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
costs so for a family um these are also
 
02:37:04.469 --> 02:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
costs actually that do appear in line
 
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
items in the school district budgets um
 
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
so there are ways to get it information
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
but to to quarterly report on something
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
like that or to the types of service you
 
02:37:15.550 --> 02:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
know again as has been said absolutely
 
02:37:17.469 --> 02:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable and really
 
02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
detrimental I think to family
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
um families are not necessarily choosing
 
02:37:25.269 --> 02:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
ADT into using taxpayer dollars for
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
special education just like every other
 
02:37:29.469 --> 02:37:29.479 align:start position:0%
family with a student you know we we
 
02:37:32.190 --> 02:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
think of that being you know you use
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
public education families sometimes opt
 
02:37:36.030 --> 02:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
out of using public education but
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're not opting into taxpayer dollars
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
or or you know even the concept of
 
02:37:43.469 --> 02:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
choice to use taxpayer dollars for
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
special education I think has some
 
02:37:48.590 --> 02:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
problematic elements to it um just for
 
02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
the sake of understanding as well or or
 
02:37:54.190 --> 02:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
Clarity um Miss Dunham touched on this a
 
02:37:56.790 --> 02:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
bit but reporting on the number of
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
students making adequate progress toward
 
02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:00.429 align:start position:0%
students making adequate progress toward
IEP

02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
IEP
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
goals you know as the advocate for
 
02:38:05.190 --> 02:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
special education I think um you know I
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
would love to see our superintendent
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
really focused on that but I want to be
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
clear on what that would entail um and I
 
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
don't know that the legislature you know
 
02:38:15.230 --> 02:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
if the legislature feels it prudent to
 
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
do this I think that would be great but
 
02:38:18.910 --> 02:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
really you know the only people with
 
02:38:21.269 --> 02:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
that information on whether a student is
 
02:38:23.429 --> 02:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
making adequate progress to the I goals
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
which is the standard would be um case
 
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
managers for every IEP team for every
 
02:38:31.469 --> 02:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
student in a district so you would be
 
02:38:34.269 --> 02:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
asking superintendents to quarterly have
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
those discussions with every case
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
manager which might be a good thing um I
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
I personally think our superintendents
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
and Schoolboard members need to um
 
02:38:45.309 --> 02:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes know quite a bit more about
 
02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
the special education in their districts
 
02:38:49.469 --> 02:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
but I don't think this is um the way to
 
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
accomplish that uh and again seconding
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
much of what has already been said in
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the um person identifiable
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
nature and the inappropriateness of
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
focusing on costs because those costs
 
02:39:05.830 --> 02:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
are simply compliance with Federal you
 
02:39:09.269 --> 02:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
know and state laws and you know we need
 
02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
to look separately in a different way at
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
cost of special education um not through
 
02:39:16.990 --> 02:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
public disclosure because it's not a
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer decision about whether or not
 
02:39:22.030 --> 02:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
those costs get allocated that way and
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
with that I would be happy to take any
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
02:39:28.269 --> 02:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
representative Morris thanks for taking
 
02:39:30.269 --> 02:39:30.279 align:start position:0%
the question thanks for let me answer Mr
 
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
chair um so I just had a quick question
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
because I keep getting a range of
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
different numbers from various different
 
02:39:37.150 --> 02:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
school districts as well as par
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
professionals so when it comes to
 
02:39:41.710 --> 02:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
average cost for student with special
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
needs I've heard numbers anywhere
 
02:39:46.190 --> 02:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
between 50,000 all the way up to 250,000
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
per year do you have like a is that kind
 
02:39:52.590 --> 02:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
of accurate to say um so I'm going to
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
try to answer that somewhat specifically
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
and then also say I think um I am going
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
to try to answer that in in some of the
 
02:40:01.990 --> 02:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
bills dealing with the adequacy funding
 
02:40:04.110 --> 02:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
um that are also coming up but we have
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
multiple categories of students with
 
02:40:09.070 --> 02:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
disability um that are reported I think
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of doe but um the vast majority of
 
02:40:13.469 --> 02:40:13.479 align:start position:0%
our students we have about 30,000 plus
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
students in the state um with special
 
02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:16.990 align:start position:0%
students in the state um with special
education

02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:40:19.910 --> 02:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
IEPs um the vast majority of those let's
 
02:40:23.309 --> 02:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
call it above 25,000 are in the category
 
02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
of lowest need so that 50,000 number Etc
 
02:40:28.830 --> 02:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
would not be applicable there and again
 
02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's the vast majority of students um
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
it is a number probably above any
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding currently then you have
 
02:40:38.590 --> 02:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
another category which are your students
 
02:40:41.309 --> 02:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
who are receiving you know a significant
 
02:40:42.990 --> 02:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
number of services pulled out of the
 
02:40:45.870 --> 02:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
regular education classroom category B
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
fewer than 5,000 students your category
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
is your highest cost and when you're
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
talking about numbers that go up you
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
know above 50 or 75,000 you're probably
 
02:40:59.230 --> 02:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
talking about that category C and those
 
02:41:00.910 --> 02:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
numbers can go very high right those
 
02:41:04.349 --> 02:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
numbers can easily be 75 to
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
250,000 and higher um very small number
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
of students so it really to understand
 
02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
it you have to get into the breakdown of
 
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
those categories of students that we
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
have um for cost analysis
 
02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:20.550 align:start position:0%
have um for cost analysis
thank

02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:41:23.309 --> 02:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
02:41:25.150 --> 02:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
very much for being here today thank you
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm sure uh uh you'll be seeing
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
around tomorrow with those
 
02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:33.269 align:start position:0%
around tomorrow with those
bills

02:41:33.269 --> 02:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
so that ends our morning hearings and um
 
02:41:41.389 --> 02:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
we have until 1:30 which is our next
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing so you have plenty of time to
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
lunch yes I'm going to go check the
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%

03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:52.399 align:start position:0%
um we're going to get started with our
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
first bill I just mention in case anyone
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
is here for our last bill um which is
 
03:55:03.990 --> 03:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
571 uh the Constitution Day bill at
 
03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:05.550 align:start position:0%
571 uh the Constitution Day bill at
4:00

03:55:05.550 --> 03:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
4:00
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
um um it it's is going to take a little
 
03:55:11.870 --> 03:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
longer than expected so and the prime
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor is busy in another committee um
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
so what we will do is just introduce it
 
03:55:21.229 --> 03:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
at 4:00 and recess it uh to a date uh
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
probably the week after
 
03:55:25.990 --> 03:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
next um that way can all get home a
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
little earlier
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
also so
 
03:55:33.389 --> 03:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
um representative kab were you going to
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
introduce this one great so this is
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
677 requiring schools to maintain a
 
03:55:44.590 --> 03:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
supply of EpiPen injectors for use in
 
03:55:47.389 --> 03:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
the event of an emergency and uh
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative cutab welcome thank you
 
03:55:52.429 --> 03:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
for having me here today for the record
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
my name is representative Caitlyn cab
 
03:55:57.309 --> 03:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 17 I'm
 
03:55:59.950 --> 03:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of this bill unfortunately
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor couldn't be here he's
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
out uh plowing plowing people out of the
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
snow so he regrettably couldn't make it
 
03:56:09.910 --> 03:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
I hope that this bill will be a breath
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
of uh fresh air from the normal partisan
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
bills that this committee typically
 
03:56:18.510 --> 03:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
um which committee does that happen
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:26.189 --> 03:56:26.199 align:start position:0%
dreams um up until last year it was up
 
03:56:29.229 --> 03:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
to um parents to provide the epinephrine
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
to the school districts and that law
 
03:56:34.990 --> 03:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
last year enabled the districts to
 
03:56:37.990 --> 03:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
provide a stock of EP epinephrine
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
however it didn't require them to this
 
03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
bill is requiring them to because it is
 
03:56:44.910 --> 03:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
a life-saving
 
03:56:47.830 --> 03:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
it is a life-saving medication
 
03:56:50.110 --> 03:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately in New Hampshire we
 
03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how many kids have needed it
 
03:56:53.550 --> 03:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire schools this bill would
 
03:56:55.830 --> 03:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
require the the tracking data we
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
currently require that if the districts
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
use it that they keep a report but
 
03:57:01.710 --> 03:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
they're not required to send that report
 
03:57:03.510 --> 03:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere nor post it anywhere so we just
 
03:57:06.269 --> 03:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
simply don't have the data to to suggest
 
03:57:08.670 --> 03:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
although this would provide us with that
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
data but when you look at National
 
03:57:14.750 --> 03:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
averages about there's about six uses
 
03:57:17.550 --> 03:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
per year per 100,000 pupils and so to
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
put that into perspective Massachusetts
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
does track the data and in one school
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
year recent school year it was uh 263
 
03:57:27.229 --> 03:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
students that required the use of
 
03:57:30.149 --> 03:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis and of
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
those there were um 66 students that did
 
03:57:36.990 --> 03:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
not have a prescription for epinephrine
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
and used the school's stock
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
epinephrine and um so about 25% of the
 
03:57:47.070 --> 03:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
time when e is given there is no known
 
03:57:49.990 --> 03:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
allergy and there are currently programs
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
available through both this is also
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
adding in the ability to use nephy spray
 
03:57:56.389 --> 03:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
new product instead of having to use the
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
injector unfortunately right now it's
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
only available for probably with the
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
weight range it is probably for fifth
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
grade and above although there is from
 
03:58:10.429 --> 03:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding um an emergency
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
application to allow that for younger
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
kiddos but it's not yet been approved um
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
so there are programs available that
 
03:58:18.990 --> 03:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
actually offer this to the districts for
 
03:58:20.990 --> 03:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
free and the districts only have to fill
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
out one form for the entire
 
03:58:25.710 --> 03:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
District um with the medication provider
 
03:58:28.349 --> 03:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
and they will give them a stock of up to
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
um they'll give them two up and effs per
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
age age group that they may need so you
 
03:58:33.309 --> 03:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
might have an elementary school that
 
03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
needs you know the the Junior and the
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
adult version and they'll give them both
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
for free as well as the nephy the nephy
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
also offers that as well so these can be
 
03:58:44.990 --> 03:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
provided at Absolut no cost to the
 
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
districts and if a district doesn't have
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
a phys provider in there our state
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
physici has agreed to uh provide any
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
District that needs it a prescription so
 
03:58:58.870 --> 03:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
there would be no no reason that this
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
would end up costing the district's any
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
money utilizing these programs and again
 
03:59:05.910 --> 03:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is a life-saving medication and
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of times that first
 
03:59:09.870 --> 03:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
allergy happens the parents had no no
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
idea that it was going to happen so my
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
now four-year-old daughter about a year
 
03:59:13.880 --> 03:59:15.269 align:start position:0%
now four-year-old daughter about a year
ago

03:59:15.269 --> 03:59:15.279 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:59:18.389 --> 03:59:18.399 align:start position:0%
had some Nutella at my in-law's house
 
03:59:20.389 --> 03:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
and I was in the Next Room over and
 
03:59:21.910 --> 03:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
about a minute after she started eating
 
03:59:26.149 --> 03:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
it I hear her go cedo my my throat is
 
03:59:29.189 --> 03:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
really itchy and um of course I get up
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
and as as I walk out I see like all
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
around her face is red and my husband is
 
03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
upstairs another level who's a physician
 
03:59:37.950 --> 03:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
so I grab her and I'm like let's get
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
upstairs go see Daddy and by the time we
 
03:59:42.110 --> 03:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
get up she's covered in Hive so it just
 
03:59:45.630 --> 03:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
it happens so quickly and particularly
 
03:59:48.149 --> 03:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
in districts that might not have EMS
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
that close by even in Windam like it's
 
03:59:52.790 --> 03:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a drive you know you it
 
03:59:54.229 --> 03:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
literally could be the difference
 
03:59:55.870 --> 03:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
between life or death and so all
 
03:59:57.469 --> 03:59:57.479 align:start position:0%
districts really should have this
 
03:59:59.670 --> 03:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
medication available I'm happy to take
 
04:00:03.590 --> 04:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
any questions uh thank you very much uh
 
04:00:06.229 --> 04:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you Mr chair um
 
04:00:07.750 --> 04:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this bill forward
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
as the parent of a child who has also
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
had to have EP an epinephrine injection
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
um done on them I empathize I'm curious
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
um to know whether or not there is any
 
04:00:22.830 --> 04:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
possibility of getting adult doses
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
because often times my understanding is
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
even the junior dose even with little
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
guys is not necessarily enough so would
 
04:00:32.590 --> 04:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
they have access to a varying range of
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
like the Junior and the regular dosing
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of age thank you for taking
 
04:00:41.070 --> 04:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so this
 
04:00:43.710 --> 04:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
would enable the the nurse to determine
 
04:00:45.349 --> 04:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
the quantity and type that the school
 
04:00:49.030 --> 04:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
should maintain so assuming that there
 
04:00:51.630 --> 04:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
is most schools would probably have both
 
04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
because you could technically also use
 
04:00:55.630 --> 04:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
this for staff so even if you only had
 
04:00:57.550 --> 04:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
kiddos that were under you know the
 
04:00:59.229 --> 04:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
weight limit they I assume that they
 
04:01:02.910 --> 04:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
would also have the adult dosage however
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
typically using something like you would
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
you the nurse would would likely be
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
guesstimating looking at the child if
 
04:01:11.229 --> 04:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
they needed this one or that one but in
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
terms of giving a child that they knew
 
04:01:17.189 --> 04:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
was under the weight limit for the adult
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
one they would probably give the
 
04:01:19.870 --> 04:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
juvenile one and then they would give a
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
second dose if that was needed but I
 
04:01:23.349 --> 04:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
don't think that this would allow them
 
04:01:23.359 --> 04:01:24.750 align:start position:0%
don't think that this would allow them
to

04:01:24.750 --> 04:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:27.229 --> 04:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
just for liability reasons typically
 
04:01:29.710 --> 04:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
unless your doctor gives you one that is
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
kind of you know using it off label the
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
label would say that the weight limit is
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
you know whatever it is and it' be up to
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the nurse to determine
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
in that moment which they have to
 
04:01:41.309 --> 04:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
estimate weights for for many things in
 
04:01:42.910 --> 04:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
in many other cases so I think they'd be
 
04:01:46.030 --> 04:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:48.510 --> 04:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative try thank you Mr chairman
 
04:01:50.910 --> 04:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question with the
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
aeds we've been trying to place them in
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
a place where they are easily accessible
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
not behind a locked door things like
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
that is there any reason that we should
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
maybe have to put this into this bill
 
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
too to be make it be
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
accessible so I that's a great question
 
04:02:08.389 --> 04:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
so I actually did ask this of the
 
04:02:10.149 --> 04:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
districts and I was the way it was
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
explained to me was that often times
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
they are in the nurse's office and not
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
usually locked they're not locked when
 
04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
the nurse's office is open um and then
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
if the nurse has to leave the building
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
there are some districts that share
 
04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
nurses across the different schools and
 
04:02:27.469 --> 04:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
so they kind of go to do med passes when
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
that happens they have like a red bag
 
04:02:30.389 --> 04:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's kind of their jump kit and they
 
04:02:32.910 --> 04:02:32.920 align:start position:0%
stick that into the principal's office
 
04:02:34.830 --> 04:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
so that it's available through there so
 
04:02:37.070 --> 04:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
that at no time it's really the kids
 
04:02:39.870 --> 04:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't accidentally get into it um but
 
04:02:42.750 --> 04:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
that um it's not like left out on the
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
Shelf either I guess if that kind of
 
04:02:49.389 --> 04:02:49.399 align:start position:0%
answers because I think with an AED you
 
04:02:52.429 --> 04:02:52.439 align:start position:0%
can't if you're not in if you're not in
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
an abnormal Rhythm even if you were to
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
put that on to somebody it won't allow
 
04:02:58.349 --> 04:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
you to shock the person but with this
 
04:03:00.189 --> 04:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent somebody from
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
using it if it was just in a box like
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
that I that's a follow up thank you I
 
04:03:07.229 --> 04:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
think yes I think I understand that part
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that even with qualified
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
user and a qualified recipient um it the
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
access is timely and um and we've been
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
seeing that some of these kind of things
 
04:03:22.750 --> 04:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
are triggered outside and so with a with
 
04:03:24.550 --> 04:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
a locked principal's office or a locked
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
school um it's just kind
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
of not not a great not accessible how
 
04:03:32.910 --> 04:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
about that I agree with you completely I
 
04:03:34.670 --> 04:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
think for the stock one you have to
 
04:03:36.110 --> 04:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
probably leave it in at a centralized
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
location I know for my daughter it
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
actually says that it can't be in a lock
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
location and has to be with her like
 
04:03:45.149 --> 04:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
accessible to her at all times so um
 
04:03:46.750 --> 04:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
currently she's in preschool so when she
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
goes out onto preschool like onto the
 
04:03:50.790 --> 04:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
playground they have to carry their jump
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
bag outside to the playground with her
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
and so I think the students their
 
04:03:56.349 --> 04:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
Physicians could
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
write that it has to be with the student
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
and not in a locked nurse's office I I
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
would guess but for the stock one I'm
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
not sure how that would work because
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
they would have to maybe stock many
 
04:04:09.429 --> 04:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
multiple of them if you are you asking
 
04:04:11.149 --> 04:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
for the stock one or for the individual
 
04:04:13.870 --> 04:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
student I asking for the stock one yeah
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
so depending on the size of the school I
 
04:04:19.269 --> 04:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
would I'm not sure like are you are you
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
suggesting like if if the kids are
 
04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
outside like also having one like in the
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
playground area we haven't gotten that
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
far with the aeds but it might be good
 
04:04:30.630 --> 04:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
of us to consider them at the same time
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
because they're used in similar kind of
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
situations that makes sense
 
04:04:38.149 --> 04:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
I having you know having multiple you
 
04:04:39.670 --> 04:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
know especially if if there's a big
 
04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:41.159 align:start position:0%
district and it takes a while to get
 
04:04:42.670 --> 04:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
from the nurse's office you know to a
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
playground or whatnot
 
04:04:46.349 --> 04:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
that that would be a reasonable option
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
and and the districts can this does
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
enable them to determine the quantity
 
04:04:52.830 --> 04:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
that they need so they could stock
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
multiple in there that's that's a really
 
04:04:56.790 --> 04:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
great Point that's a good point too
 
04:05:00.670 --> 04:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you r s thank you and
 
04:05:03.229 --> 04:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I I
 
04:05:05.070 --> 04:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
having had to administer an EpiPen to a
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
kindergartener when I was a teacher I
 
04:05:09.469 --> 04:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate the value of this bill um I'm
 
04:05:11.750 --> 04:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
curious where this committee will be
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
later I don't know if it's today or next
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
week um hearing bills that make it so
 
04:05:18.670 --> 04:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
that School nurses can't prescribe uh
 
04:05:21.269 --> 04:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
any medication or recommend any
 
04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
medication how this bill would fit in
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
with those bills would whether they
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be contradict because they seem to
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
be contradictory bills that we're
 
04:05:31.070 --> 04:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
hearing and how that matches up in terms
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
of Concepts if you have any idea I have
 
04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
not reviewed those bills but now that
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
You' brought it to my attention I'll
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
definitely review and ensure that we
 
04:05:42.429 --> 04:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
have an exception in there for this as
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
well as um for albuterol because I know
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
that those are the two medications in
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
this statute that we allow the nurses to
 
04:05:53.670 --> 04:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
stock and so there I mean those are both
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
again life-saving medications that we
 
04:05:56.990 --> 04:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that there's exceptions
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
for so thank you for bringing that to my
 
04:05:59.590 --> 04:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
attention I will definitely check but
 
04:06:00.910 --> 04:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the answer to the question
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head follow thank you
 
04:06:06.030 --> 04:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
and then the title of the pill specifies
 
04:06:09.389 --> 04:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
epipens um which is a name brand which
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
tends to be rather expensive compared to
 
04:06:14.189 --> 04:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
the um generic
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
versions the content of the bill doesn't
 
04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
seem to specify that it has to be an
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
epip pen and I just wonder about um
 
04:06:24.309 --> 04:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
finding the balance where I know you're
 
04:06:25.670 --> 04:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
saying that currently there are programs
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
that would fund this but if at some
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
point it doesn't especially where they
 
04:06:31.149 --> 04:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
expire after a certain number of months
 
04:06:33.349 --> 04:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
and have to be replaced I know from
 
04:06:34.510 --> 04:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
parents in my community they're
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive when you have to
 
04:06:38.630 --> 04:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
replace them thank you for the question
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
so EpiPen is just as part a part of the
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
title but it's not at all a part of the
 
04:06:44.670 --> 04:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
statute that would be implemented and
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
the statute piece does say epinephrine
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
Auto injectors and then it does further
 
04:06:52.830 --> 04:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
Define that an epinephrine auto injector
 
04:06:52.840 --> 04:06:53.870 align:start position:0%
Define that an epinephrine auto injector
also

04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:06:58.630 --> 04:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
includes um nasal spray um in the in in
 
04:07:00.269 --> 04:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
part four
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
section yeah right on line 2022 so I
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
think that's just the ti unfortunately
 
04:07:07.389 --> 04:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
sponsors co-sponsors don't get to choose
 
04:07:10.149 --> 04:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
the titles with these OS kind of takes
 
04:07:12.750 --> 04:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
the Liberty to put but the um statute
 
04:07:14.510 --> 04:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
itself definitely does say it's epine
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
and auto injectors because that is a
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
really great point it they can be really
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
expensive by brand name so that wouldn't
 
04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's kind of just for the bill
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
purposes but then once the statute gets
 
04:07:27.910 --> 04:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.030 --> 04:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
pen any further
 
04:07:32.389 --> 04:07:32.399 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent Cornell Thank
 
04:07:34.349 --> 04:07:34.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
does this have to be administered by a
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
nurse or can other people in the
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
building be trained to do it I I
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear that's a great question so
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
other other others that are trained in
 
04:07:49.070 --> 04:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
this can also administer just like they
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
can for a kiddo that has an allergy and
 
04:07:52.510 --> 04:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
I know you know sometimes people will
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
ask well if it's not prescribed to the
 
04:07:56.670 --> 04:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
child How would how would the teacher
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
know that the child needs it well the
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
symptoms for an allergy are going to be
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
the same rather the child's diagnosed
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
with it or not so you need the teachers
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
that are trained in this need to be able
 
04:08:07.389 --> 04:08:07.399 align:start position:0%
to identify if there is an emergent
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
situation and I had never seen an
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
allergy like that in my life and I was
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
able to quickly identify it it's very
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
obvious um so others that have been
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
trained can can do it it's just the
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
nurse that's that's deciding determining
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
the quantity of the medication but in
 
04:08:23.950 --> 04:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
terms of giving it it would be um
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
anybody that was trained in it followup
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
yes follow do you know anything about
 
04:08:31.149 --> 04:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
the training is it just a simple
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
training no no in representative dry
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
might know more about it but the Nurses
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
Association does have quite the training
 
04:08:41.550 --> 04:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
on it um and I believe it's like a 2hour
 
04:08:43.469 --> 04:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
training but I'll let representative dve
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
I am a an CPR instructor trainer yes um
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
anybody can give it to somebody who it's
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
prescribed to you can help them with
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
their medication and um since this is
 
04:08:58.309 --> 04:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
now under a blanket authorization there
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any problem with that if
 
04:09:03.309 --> 04:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
the symptoms are there and um 911 an
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
emergency is always helpful and you can
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
get medical control for doing that
 
04:09:11.550 --> 04:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
too thank you represent Murray and thank
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you thank you for
 
04:09:15.189 --> 04:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question I do know I just want
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure as far as I'm aware every
 
04:09:21.229 --> 04:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
anytime there is epinephrine used um the
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
child immediately goes to either the
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
emergency room or follows follows up
 
04:09:25.910 --> 04:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
with a doctor so this is not like this
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
life-saving uh instance where somebody
 
04:09:31.590 --> 04:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
is trained some of these injectors also
 
04:09:33.550 --> 04:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
will talk to you and tell you what to do
 
04:09:37.469 --> 04:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
with them so um I just and there one
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
small point about them being stored
 
04:09:40.389 --> 04:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
outside they're heat sensitive some of
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
them so wherever they would be I just
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
04:09:47.109 --> 04:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
um where it makes sense for them to be
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
where they are um so to that point I
 
04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
guess I was what I was trying to ask was
 
04:09:55.870 --> 04:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
um with regard to these um there's
 
04:09:57.790 --> 04:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
there's usually a followup after the
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
incident correct with EMS or something
 
04:10:03.670 --> 04:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
else yeah and so that would be that is
 
04:10:05.550 --> 04:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
there is a piece you know in the statute
 
04:10:07.149 --> 04:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
that says that it would obviously have
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
to be immediately reported to the nurse
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
um and then their training obviously
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
requires them to immediately cont
 
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
usually they'll contact EMS first and
 
04:10:16.790 --> 04:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
then the parent or simultaneously if
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
there's two nurses in the in the office
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's covered under
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
their training which that New Hampshire
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association does have and it
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
actually does state in the bill that a
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
designated assisted Personnel shall be
 
04:10:32.189 --> 04:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
identified um so that all so that as
 
04:10:33.670 --> 04:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
many hours of the school day are covered
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
by at least one person so if the nurse
 
04:10:37.109 --> 04:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be there that there is
 
04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
somebody that's trained on this that's
 
04:10:41.229 --> 04:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
always on
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
site great see no further questions
 
04:10:47.950 --> 04:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for coming in for
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
this um I think we have one more card
 
04:10:51.439 --> 04:10:59.790 align:start position:0%
this um I think we have one more card
Nancy

04:10:59.790 --> 04:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
Beerman it has been a very busy medical
 
04:11:06.189 --> 04:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
day today um Nancy Beerman um just to
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
let you know because I'm testifying
 
04:11:09.309 --> 04:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
about something medical that I am on the
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rare disease advisory
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
Council I'm speaking for myself and not
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
the council
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
and not for the council today sorry
 
04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um I have a different uh I
 
04:11:21.990 --> 04:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
first of all I approve of this bill um
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
but I have a point of view because I
 
04:11:26.349 --> 04:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
have a child that needed an epip pen I
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
had um a sibling that has um had an epip
 
04:11:32.469 --> 04:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
pen and I have been a teacher in the
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
classroom with a child um that had an
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
epip pen um so um the scariest of all of
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
them um wasn't my daughter it was the
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
child in the classroom because um all
 
04:11:47.070 --> 04:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
she had to do is touch something and she
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
could go into an allergic reaction um
 
04:11:53.349 --> 04:11:53.359 align:start position:0%
and for that parent um paying for the
 
04:11:55.790 --> 04:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
epip pen or any kind of auto injector
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
was very expensive and she couldn't have
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
multiple ones most parents have one in
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
the school nurse's office and one at
 
04:12:04.670 --> 04:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
home she can only afford one so we would
 
04:12:07.030 --> 04:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that um we had a bag
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we literally passed back and forth
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
to each other each time so for that
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
parent um you know it was very
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
concerning the one day that oops we
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
forgot the bag and I had to ask my
 
04:12:19.469 --> 04:12:19.479 align:start position:0%
administrator permission I'm like can I
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
go zip this home during my lunch break
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
to this poor child um um so they had it
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
um thankfully we never had to use it but
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
um that child's allergies were very very
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
severe um um as far as having a child
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
with it um it is um difficult to
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
um figure out exactly what you're
 
04:12:43.189 --> 04:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with the upy pen um I got
 
04:12:44.870 --> 04:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe about 5 minutes training from the
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
doctor here's an epip pen read the
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
insert and good luck and hope you don't
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
ever have to use it um an EpiPen is a
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
stop Gap measure it's just supposed to
 
04:12:57.389 --> 04:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
stop the allergic reaction until EMS can
 
04:13:00.349 --> 04:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
arrive um and a lot of times if your EMS
 
04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
is from far away and I used to be a
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
lifeguard and they taught us this too if
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
the EMS is far away you're going to have
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
to give double dose um if the reaction
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
starts occurring again until they can
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
get there
 
04:13:14.590 --> 04:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
um there is also um another bill
 
04:13:18.830 --> 04:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
h63 um that was heard in uh Health and
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
Human Services and it was in regards to
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
the um Auto injectors that were the
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
nasal spray so that was heard um on
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:33.600 --> 04:13:36.309 align:start position:0%
 
included

04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
included
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
um just so that you guys are all on the
 
04:13:41.469 --> 04:13:41.479 align:start position:0%
same page um this bill allows authorized
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
entities includ entities including
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
schools camps and daycare facilities to
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
possess and administer epine and nasal
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
spray to treat
 
04:13:52.710 --> 04:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
anaphylaxis um the law currently uh
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
permits FN fnf Administration through
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
utter injectors so they're um so you
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
might want to look into house bill
 
04:14:00.840 --> 04:14:03.550 align:start position:0%
might want to look into house bill
63

04:14:03.550 --> 04:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
63
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:13.670 --> 04:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
63 I was telling representa cordelli I'm
 
04:14:15.830 --> 04:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
like there's another bill out there
 
04:14:17.790 --> 04:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
trying to keep track of all these is is
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely crazy so um um but again um
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
we were fortunate our health insurance
 
04:14:25.870 --> 04:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
company provided two epipens so uh my
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
daughter was um allowed to have one at
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
the nurse's office and we kept one at
 
04:14:30.510 --> 04:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
home and so we didn't have to do the
 
04:14:33.389 --> 04:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
whole traveling thing um I also have um
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
a relative that has severe allergies and
 
04:14:38.550 --> 04:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
she was a school teacher herself and uh
 
04:14:40.910 --> 04:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
she had to make sure she had one on and
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
um she actually had to use it one day um
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
while she was at school and her um
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
allergies are very um mysterious we
 
04:14:50.429 --> 04:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
never know when she's going to react she
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
can react to foods and she can react to
 
04:14:55.670 --> 04:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
smells and um so if there's an odor in
 
04:14:58.109 --> 04:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
the air she can also go into anaphylaxis
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
and she's had two episodes of that and
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
the doctors can't figure it out but
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
thankfully we have the FIP pen and and
 
04:15:07.790 --> 04:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
medical um people there immediately to
 
04:15:09.229 --> 04:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
help her
 
04:15:14.189 --> 04:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you questions represent
 
04:15:15.910 --> 04:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as well
 
04:15:20.429 --> 04:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
um I I the student that I taught the
 
04:15:22.269 --> 04:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
smell of peanut butter two classrooms
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
away was sufficient to send them into
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
anaxa so I recognized the terror of that
 
04:15:29.229 --> 04:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
we had to have a peanut free school and
 
04:15:32.269 --> 04:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
among other things but um for people who
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
experience this level of allergic
 
04:15:35.870 --> 04:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
reaction um or at least in your
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
experience of people who've had this
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
level of allergic reaction how quickly
 
04:15:42.109 --> 04:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
do they go from fine to um anaphylaxis
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
which is you know blocking their ability
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
to breathe in in what you've seen and I
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
recognize you're not a medical expert
 
04:15:51.870 --> 04:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
yeah no I have my mom degree um is what
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
I say when I talk to doctors
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
um it would depend if that person had
 
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
had that um trigger prior but sometimes
 
04:16:04.510 --> 04:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
triggers can go from Z to 60 and nobody
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
knows why it's a mystery they don't know
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
why someone will get a be sting and be
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
fine and another person gets a beting
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
and need an an EP pen immediately and
 
04:16:15.550 --> 04:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
another one will have just a mild
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
reaction um my daughter's um condition
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
um is called you toara and so sometimes
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
she can interact with something that's
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
cold touching drinking being out in the
 
04:16:29.870 --> 04:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
air whatever sometimes she can go and
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
she won't have any kind of reaction and
 
04:16:33.790 --> 04:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
then another time she'll be something
 
04:16:35.710 --> 04:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
that I think is benign and not a problem
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
and she'll have a she'll have a big
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
reaction and I'm like why um it's the
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
human body is a mystery and they don't
 
04:16:45.309 --> 04:16:45.319 align:start position:0%
know and um so you literally have and
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
the Mt expert can tell you you have 6
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
minutes um without if the throat is
 
04:16:52.349 --> 04:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
closed and that person is not breathing
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
if six minutes till brain damage starts
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
to occur so it's you know dire to have
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
it but unfortunately you know and with
 
04:17:02.109 --> 04:17:02.119 align:start position:0%
if you have the auto injectors um the
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
temperature thing is not going to be an
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
issue as much as the auto um the liquid
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
version of the epinephrine so yeah the
 
04:17:11.229 --> 04:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
nasal spray it's because it's a powder
 
04:17:13.189 --> 04:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
like substance so you're not going to
 
04:17:14.670 --> 04:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
have so much of a temperature issue
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
concern with having it on site but more
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
and more people are having allergic
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
reactions every day
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
and can't explain it any further
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
questions no yep no thank you very much
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
done we'll uh close the hearing on um uh
 
04:18:10.990 --> 04:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%

to Alternative dispute resolution and
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
individual individualized education plan
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
team meeting facil itation the prime
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative ball was unable
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
to be here today due to unforeseen
 
04:38:20.590 --> 04:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances we do have someone that is
 
04:38:22.109 --> 04:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
here to
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
testify yes thank you thank
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
Dunham thank
 
04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
you once again I am the constituent who
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
has for this um my name is Bonnie Dunham
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
and I live in marac New Hampshire I'm
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
here as a private citizen app parent um
 
04:38:52.029 --> 04:38:52.039 align:start position:0%
this bill is pretty simple it just moves
 
04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
IEP team facilitation from the list of
 
04:38:58.189 --> 04:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolutions or ADR
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
um options that are in RSA 186
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
c23 comma Roman r i to its own new
 
04:39:07.470 --> 04:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
section right below that this is
 
04:39:10.310 --> 04:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
important because ADR procedures like
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
mediation probably the people are most
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with are subject to certain
 
04:39:16.109 --> 04:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
requirements that cannot apply to a
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
facilitated IEP team meeting for example
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution um
 
04:39:22.949 --> 04:39:22.959 align:start position:0%
proceedings must be confidential and no
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
record can be kept of the proceedings
 
04:39:27.551 --> 04:39:27.561 align:start position:0%
but a facilitated IEP team meeting is
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
just like any other IEP meeting it's a
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
regular IEP meeting but there's a
 
04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
trained facilitator who's impartial and
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
helps the meeting run more smoothly um
 
04:39:37.708 --> 04:39:37.718 align:start position:0%
and helps the parent and the school
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
district to work together to reach
 
04:39:41.030 --> 04:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
agreement sometimes on issues that were
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
in dispute other times they're asked to
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
participate before there's a dispute to
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
help people to reach um reach agreement
 
04:39:51.270 --> 04:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
more quickly and and easily using
 
04:39:52.990 --> 04:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
effective collaboration and
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
communication it's a best practice IEP
 
04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
team facilitation can help IEP teams to
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
reach agreement early in the process and
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately reduce the need for more
 
04:40:05.070 --> 04:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
adversarial and almost always expensive
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
um adver um Regular dispute resolution
 
04:40:10.510 --> 04:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
procedures like a due process hearing
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
any IEP team meeting whether there's a
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
facilitator there or not requires a
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
record of the proceeding including What
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
was decided the reasons for the decision
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
a list of the evaluations assessments
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
records or reports used as a basis in
 
04:40:25.470 --> 04:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
making the decision any other options
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
that were considered and why they
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
weren't adopted um and any other
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
relevant factors this is not allowed
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
under the alternative dispute resolution
 
04:40:35.270 --> 04:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
procedures those restrictions that are
 
04:40:38.830 --> 04:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
listed in 186c um comma 23 Roman numeral
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
4 this issue was actually first
 
04:40:43.190 --> 04:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
identified in
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
2015 um when Senate Bill 166 removed
 
04:40:50.110 --> 04:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
facilitated IEP um Team meetings from
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
the um RSA 186 c23 where it had been
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
inserted a few years before um and in
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
the house calendar for the date when
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
that um hearing was was being voted on
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
the education committee re um explained
 
04:41:05.390 --> 04:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind their unanimous oop
 
04:41:08.350 --> 04:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation writing regular IEP
 
04:41:10.590 --> 04:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
team meetings are informal procedures
 
04:41:12.430 --> 04:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
and during these meetings actions or
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
discussions leading to decisions are
 
04:41:17.628 --> 04:41:17.638 align:start position:0%
recorded a facilitated IEP meeting has a
 
04:41:19.830 --> 04:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
trained facilitator assisting in meeting
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
the pro and meeting procedure idea and
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
RSA 186c demand confidentiality and
 
04:41:27.628 --> 04:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
preclude recordkeeping during these
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
meetings this bill will remove
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
facilitated IEP team meetings so they
 
04:41:34.788 --> 04:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
it's they'll remove it from that section
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
um it won't be an alternative dispute
 
04:41:38.430 --> 04:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
resolution option any longer but it will
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
still be a dispute resolution option
 
04:41:42.430 --> 04:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Education will
 
04:41:44.110 --> 04:41:44.120 align:start position:0%
make available to parents in school
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
districts who wish to utilize it in
 
04:41:49.750 --> 04:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
order to um come to to come to agreement
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
more readily um and so it really is just
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
fixing a mistake and I thank you for
 
04:41:58.830 --> 04:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
supporting it I'm just assuming you
 
04:42:01.230 --> 04:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
will that seemed a little preemptive I
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you um any questions for
 
04:42:05.878 --> 04:42:06.948 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you um any questions for
Miss

04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
Dunham uh I just am wondering um in uh
 
04:42:18.510 --> 04:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
c23 is room Roman numerals 2 3 4 Etc
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
right uh does any of that also apply to
 
04:42:23.788 --> 04:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
mediation I'm just wondering there are
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
time frames Etc um are those different
 
04:42:32.470 --> 04:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
because mediation has its own section uh
 
04:42:32.480 --> 04:42:34.150 align:start position:0%
because mediation has its own section uh
c24

04:42:34.150 --> 04:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
c24
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
so any alternative dispute resolution
 
04:42:38.390 --> 04:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings like um mediation and
 
04:42:40.230 --> 04:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
neutral conference is the other one
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
available in New Hampshire
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
are required to be confidential no
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
record they also whatever is um whatever
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
is discussed at the meeting can't be
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
used in a later proceeding with certain
 
04:42:52.750 --> 04:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
exceptions things like that but then
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
they have another section on mediation
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
and another section on neutral
 
04:42:59.310 --> 04:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
conference that get add some more uh
 
04:43:02.510 --> 04:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
procedure specific
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
requirements does that answer that okay
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
I think so I just wanted to make sure
 
04:43:13.708 --> 04:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
that nothing in Romans uh 2 three four
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh five um apply to um mediation um that
 
04:43:21.628 --> 04:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
needs to be um adjusted also but you
 
04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
know looking through it I don't see
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
offhand the word um
 
04:43:30.510 --> 04:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
mediation um in those sections no it was
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
just facilitated IEP meetings was the
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
only problem there thank you thank you
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
um further
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
fet good afternoon representative
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you um we
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
just she go like where'd you go um so we
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
had last year asked for this to be
 
04:44:16.510 --> 04:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
placed back into the alternative dispute
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
resolution um language in 186 c24 um not
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
c24 c23 um this was part of our
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
legislative audit from last year that it
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
was not in rules that need to be placed
 
04:44:29.510 --> 04:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
back in there we placed it here because
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
it is um recognized as an alternative
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution it is recognized by
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
the federal office of special education
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
programs as an alternative dispute
 
04:44:41.230 --> 04:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
resolution and it is um when we work
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
with our TA provider Cadre it is also
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
recognized as an alternative dispute
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
resolution so while I I hear the
 
04:44:50.830 --> 04:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
concerns that were expressed um it maybe
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
we need to look at it slightly
 
04:44:53.590 --> 04:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
differently and and change some of the
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
language to address the concerns
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
regarding IEP facilitation but it is an
 
04:44:58.948 --> 04:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution and that
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
was why we placed it here in the last
 
04:45:00.560 --> 04:45:03.430 align:start position:0%
was why we placed it here in the last
legislative

04:45:03.430 --> 04:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.440 --> 04:45:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
session

04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:45:09.030 --> 04:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Cornell thank
 
04:45:10.590 --> 04:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
04:45:12.550 --> 04:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
but I got I just got confused are you
 
04:45:15.270 --> 04:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
for it or against it um the department
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
does not go do for or against so um it
 
04:45:19.830 --> 04:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
we just were explaining why we had
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
placed it here last year when we put it
 
04:45:23.070 --> 04:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
through for legislation it had come in
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
our up in our audit so that was why we
 
04:45:27.910 --> 04:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
placed it in this section it should be
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
with alternative dispute resolution but
 
04:45:30.990 --> 04:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to look at changing
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
something possibly changing some of the
 
04:45:34.430 --> 04:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
other language rather than moving it to
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
a completely separate
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
section represent try thank you and
 
04:45:41.788 --> 04:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if we
 
04:45:43.910 --> 04:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
move it like this bill suggests will
 
04:45:47.230 --> 04:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
your next audit turn up the same
 
04:45:52.030 --> 04:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
problem that's a good question I'm not
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
sure represent SEL thank you and I
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge I got a little Tangled Up in
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
the different components of of how you
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
were explaining things so this specific
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
process the department moved because of
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
an audit if I'm understanding correctly
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
and it's possible that there's some
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
concerns the the way it's currently
 
04:46:13.590 --> 04:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
written in terms of privacy because of
 
04:46:16.110 --> 04:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
the way mediation works or that we maybe
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
need to change the language I'm just
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
trying to understand sure I I got
 
04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
confused so um last year we um went
 
04:46:24.670 --> 04:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
through an a legislative audit for the
 
04:46:27.708 --> 04:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution processes which are
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
under um attorney Fenton and in that
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
process it they told us that um IEP
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
facilitation which had been in rule um
 
04:46:37.190 --> 04:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
had been taken out and we but we
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
continued to operate IEP facilitation
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
and they suggested that we put it back
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
into law so that it was we could
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
continue to operate it it's a very good
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
like it it is extremely helpful to
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
districts extremely helpful to parents
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
um it is being used more frequently as
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
we talk about it more it gets used more
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
frequently um and it and it is
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
considered an alternative dispute
 
04:46:58.430 --> 04:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
resolution process I believe what um
 
04:47:00.030 --> 04:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Dunham had shared was that some of
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
the language in 2 three 4 um in that
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
that same section do not apply to I IEP
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
facilitation um and only apply to the
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
other two pieces okay thank you very
 
04:47:11.200 --> 04:47:12.310 align:start position:0%
other two pieces okay thank you very
much

04:47:12.310 --> 04:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
sure representative Woodcock chairman
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good to see you um if my
 
04:47:19.750 --> 04:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
assumption then based on what you're
 
04:47:21.390 --> 04:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
saying now is
 
04:47:25.510 --> 04:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
that given the bill as it presented you
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
you don't think it's best to supported
 
04:47:29.470 --> 04:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
based on the audit and my second
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
assumption is if you don't then you're
 
04:47:32.910 --> 04:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
talking alternative language would the
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
department be prepared to provide
 
04:47:37.990 --> 04:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:41.548 --> 04:47:41.558 align:start position:0%
used yeah so I am suggesting that it
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
stay under alternative dispute
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
resolution because it is an alternative
 
04:47:47.310 --> 04:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution we had we had placed
 
04:47:48.990 --> 04:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
it back in because of the audit but we
 
04:47:50.670 --> 04:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
chose to place it back in that spot
 
04:47:53.070 --> 04:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
because federally it's recognized as an
 
04:47:55.150 --> 04:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution if you
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to leave it there and are asking
 
04:47:58.548 --> 04:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
if we would work on language then we
 
04:48:02.510 --> 04:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.110 --> 04:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
yes yes um for the questions resident
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair so I just want
 
04:48:12.150 --> 04:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
to double check and that I'm
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
understanding in rules there was a
 
04:48:16.830 --> 04:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
change that removed this no in law it's
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
so this is no sorry sorry sorry yeah it
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
was placed in rules though it was
 
04:48:24.190 --> 04:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
removed out of Statute and placed and
 
04:48:26.830 --> 04:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
granted rule making Authority it was not
 
04:48:29.390 --> 04:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
in any it was not in law or rule but it
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
was a practice that was being provided
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
to parents and so through the
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
legislative audit they said we needed to
 
04:48:36.868 --> 04:48:36.878 align:start position:0%
put it into law and then we are
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
currently working on rules for it so it
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
will be in both thank you very much it
 
04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't anywhere it had been and it was
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
taken out and then they said we needed
 
04:48:47.350 --> 04:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
to so the first step was the law and
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of working on the
 
04:48:50.910 --> 04:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
rul thank you for the clarification Yeah
 
04:48:52.430 --> 04:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
question of the chair representative
 
04:48:55.350 --> 04:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
Hall first thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so to be clear
 
04:49:00.310 --> 04:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
could you just talk one more time about
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
how different it is than what Miss
 
04:49:05.548 --> 04:49:05.558 align:start position:0%
Dunham talked about so how IEP
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
facilitation is different from the other
 
04:49:08.910 --> 04:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
two processes the whole everything
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
you're saying and what she said her Comm
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
compared to you like just you know
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
compare otherwise I'd have her come back
 
04:49:17.590 --> 04:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
up here tell us again um I believe the
 
04:49:19.230 --> 04:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
concern that Miss Dunham expressed was
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the other pieces of the legislation
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
so at 186 c23
 
04:49:28.230 --> 04:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
2345 um do not should not apply to IEP
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
facilitation I don't want to speak for
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
her but that they should not apply to
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
IEP facilitation because it a different
 
04:49:35.788 --> 04:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
process and some of those things should
 
04:49:39.788 --> 04:49:39.798 align:start position:0%
not apply to IEP facilitation which yes
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
it should not be conf IAL it is an it's
 
04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
a regular IEP team meeting the only
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion we are saying is that it is
 
04:49:47.310 --> 04:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
an alternative dispute resolution and
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
that was why we placed it in this piece
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
of the law and if we needed to rather
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
than create another whole section for
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing maybe consider changing
 
04:49:58.310 --> 04:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
some of the language to address her
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding IEP
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
facilitation thank you okay yes of the
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
chair so would it be appropriate as a
 
04:50:09.548 --> 04:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
committee to make a direction for the
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
rules process around this rather than
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
that I I would think that you know we
 
04:50:18.788 --> 04:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
could work with the Department um if
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
section if Roman 2 3 and 4 do not apply
 
04:50:22.480 --> 04:50:23.868 align:start position:0%
section if Roman 2 3 and 4 do not apply
to

04:50:23.868 --> 04:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
mediation um I think we could jointly
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
that would would uh would the department
 
04:50:38.750 --> 04:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
be willing to work with us yes on y some
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.628 --> 04:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
yeah would we be able to invite Miss
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
Dunham to participate in that meeting to
 
04:50:55.230 --> 04:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you yes represent I think I'm
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
still a little confused it's it's the
 
04:51:02.910 --> 04:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
right thing but it's in the wrong place
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
so it's in the right place but some of
 
04:51:07.350 --> 04:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
the pieces in that place do not apply to
 
04:51:07.360 --> 04:51:08.750 align:start position:0%
the pieces in that place do not apply to
IEP

04:51:08.750 --> 04:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
IEP
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
facilitation so neutral conference
 
04:51:13.628 --> 04:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
mediation and IEP facilitation are all
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
forms of alternative dispute resolution
 
04:51:17.350 --> 04:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
they're all recognized as forms of
 
04:51:19.070 --> 04:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution however
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire law as Miss D pointed
 
04:51:25.070 --> 04:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
out section 234 all only apply to
 
04:51:27.750 --> 04:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
neutral conference and mediation and so
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
she had wanted to move it out of here
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
and give it a separate section um I had
 
04:51:33.430 --> 04:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
suggested that because it is an
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution that it
 
04:51:37.150 --> 04:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
stay here and we look consider changing
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
some of the other language to address
 
04:51:44.670 --> 04:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
just going
 
04:51:49.110 --> 04:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
back just going just going back to your
 
04:51:51.708 --> 04:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
initial my initial question before then
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
F repr cordelli said so
 
04:51:56.350 --> 04:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
basically the department would be
 
04:51:59.230 --> 04:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
willing to create the additional caveat
 
04:52:02.030 --> 04:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
or car out or so that we could make both
 
04:52:03.310 --> 04:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
pieces happen that's why I asked you
 
04:52:08.910 --> 04:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.470 --> 04:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
right I think you know maybe we can uh
 
04:52:17.270 --> 04:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'll work on a resolution on a simple
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
resolution to this and uh actually um
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
pass a
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill maybe

okay we'll see what happens in the exact
session

04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:52:34.110 --> 04:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
right great thank you very much um with
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
that uh no one else that I see for this

room house bill
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%

um and then as I mentioned you know
 
04:53:01.948 --> 04:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
we'll just have someone introduce 571
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
and uh be on our way and I'll reschedule
 
04:53:04.200 --> 04:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
and uh be on our way and I'll reschedule

bill which is House Bill

governing air quality and temperature
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
issues in schools and um representative
 
05:21:56.910 --> 05:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
Sullivan is uh all set to go it looks
 
05:22:01.548 --> 05:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:05.788 --> 05:22:05.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Brian Sullivan um
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
representing Sullivan County uh District
 
05:22:10.990 --> 05:22:11.000 align:start position:0%

05:22:17.230 --> 05:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
um the
 
05:22:24.350 --> 05:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
um back in 1981 through 91 um I was
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
teaching in um uh the city of Berlin and
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
um it was little while ago um and I had
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of having a classroom that
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh faced the South um and um I have very
 
05:22:44.590 --> 05:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
distinct Recollections of being in that
 
05:22:45.990 --> 05:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
classroom when the temperatures really
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
started to sore and
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
um things have not gotten any better
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
since um HB 329 is a fairly simple bill
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
it U
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
modifies a current statute that deals
 
05:23:10.470 --> 05:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
with um air quality in schools RSA 2 200
 
05:23:10.480 --> 05:23:11.628 align:start position:0%
with um air quality in schools RSA 2 200
colon

05:23:11.628 --> 05:23:11.638 align:start position:0%
colon
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
48 and what it does is it adds air
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
temperature to the um uh air quality um
 
05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh components that should be uh looked
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
at When developing School District
 
05:23:29.708 --> 05:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
policy what what this requires a school
 
05:23:34.030 --> 05:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
board to do is to Simply think about
 
05:23:36.948 --> 05:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
ways of mitigating um high temperatures
 
05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
and other air quality issues
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
um in schools um and in thinking about
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
it they should write it into their
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
policy um the more they can do to uh
 
05:23:51.270 --> 05:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
mitigate um high temperatures um or low
 
05:23:53.548 --> 05:23:53.558 align:start position:0%
temperatures in schools the more they
 
05:23:57.310 --> 05:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
can do to make a uh environment that's
 
05:23:59.948 --> 05:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
conducive to to learning it's well known
 
05:24:02.830 --> 05:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
that as temperatures rise and get above
 
05:24:08.548 --> 05:24:08.558 align:start position:0%
80 85 90° in the classroom um the uh the
 
05:24:13.510 --> 05:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
learning declines rapidly so um this
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
does not require the school district to
 
05:24:18.990 --> 05:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
do anything specific it simply requires
 
05:24:20.910 --> 05:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
a school board to spend some time
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about the problems that are
 
05:24:25.548 --> 05:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
created by um high temperatures in
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms um so with that um I submit
 
05:24:31.868 --> 05:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'll take any questions
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions representative
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
Terry uh thank you uh sir um I have a
 
05:24:41.470 --> 05:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
recollection that a bill similar to this
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
one came before Commerce uh last session
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
were you involved with that and if so if
 
05:24:49.150 --> 05:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
or you have any knowledge of that would
 
05:24:52.110 --> 05:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
you explain uh to what extent this bill
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
is different than the one that we looked
 
05:24:56.548 --> 05:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
at last term um there was a bill last
 
05:25:00.190 --> 05:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
year um I'm somewhat familiar with it I
 
05:25:02.470 --> 05:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
was not involved with it directly seem
 
05:25:06.030 --> 05:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
very similar um but it it actually um
 
05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
was far more specific with with with
 
05:25:10.548 --> 05:25:10.558 align:start position:0%
regard to the uh various temperatures
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
where things would kick in and various
 
05:25:14.708 --> 05:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
things would have to happen this one is
 
05:25:17.868 --> 05:25:17.878 align:start position:0%
is far less specific and is simply as I
 
05:25:19.990 --> 05:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
said I'm requiring the school board to
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
think about ways of mitigating um the uh
 
05:25:25.230 --> 05:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
air temperature issues um without
 
05:25:27.430 --> 05:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily um dictating exactly what
 
05:25:29.628 --> 05:25:29.638 align:start position:0%
they have to do I think there's more
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
dictating in in the former Bill thank
 
05:25:36.030 --> 05:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:25:38.030 --> 05:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you and thank you for
 
05:25:39.868 --> 05:25:39.878 align:start position:0%
taking you my
 
05:25:43.070 --> 05:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
question can you please help me out on
 
05:25:46.430 --> 05:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
page two on line
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
three um where well it starts on line
 
05:25:50.910 --> 05:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
one the Department of Education shall
 
05:25:53.110 --> 05:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
notify every Public School in NH how to
 
05:25:55.830 --> 05:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
access the EPA tools for school's
 
05:25:57.868 --> 05:25:57.878 align:start position:0%
program and shall require public schools
 
05:26:00.190 --> 05:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
to implement the program exactly what
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
does that mean and how would that impact
 
05:26:06.350 --> 05:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
things um is there a financial impact as
 
05:26:09.390 --> 05:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
well yeah the Tools for Schools is um
 
05:26:12.670 --> 05:26:12.680 align:start position:0%
a program that's been uh in place for
 
05:26:16.548 --> 05:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
quite a long time and um it is uh I
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
believe it's and I believe someone
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
behind me could perhaps give more
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
information on this it's been a while
 
05:26:26.470 --> 05:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
since I dealt with it um in fact I think
 
05:26:28.390 --> 05:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
I'll defer the entire question if you
 
05:26:28.400 --> 05:26:30.390 align:start position:0%
I'll defer the entire question if you
don't

05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:26:32.830 --> 05:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
mind further
 
05:26:35.230 --> 05:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:40.638 --> 05:26:48.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:26:48.670 --> 05:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:48.680 --> 05:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
Damon

05:26:54.830 --> 05:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.840 --> 05:26:59.150 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

05:26:59.150 --> 05:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:01.628 --> 05:27:01.638 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you chair Celli and
 
05:27:03.548 --> 05:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
committee good afternoon to everybody
 
05:27:05.110 --> 05:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm state representative
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
hope Damon I serve the nine towns of
 
05:27:09.510 --> 05:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan District 8 I am a co-sponsor of
 
05:27:11.788 --> 05:27:11.798 align:start position:0%
this bill and I would appreciate your
 
05:27:14.510 --> 05:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
exploration and hopefully
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
support I think this is fairly simple
 
05:27:18.670 --> 05:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
legislation to understand it requires
 
05:27:20.868 --> 05:27:20.878 align:start position:0%
school districts to do three things
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
establish a policy governing air quality
 
05:27:25.190 --> 05:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
and temperature issues in schools the
 
05:27:27.150 --> 05:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
air quality part is probably already in
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
place because that's already in statute
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh secondly specify approaches to
 
05:27:34.910 --> 05:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
preventing heat illness and third Define
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
an emergency response plan the policy
 
05:27:39.948 --> 05:27:39.958 align:start position:0%
according to the proposed statute would
 
05:27:41.670 --> 05:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
need to consider methods of minimizing
 
05:27:43.868 --> 05:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
or eliminating poor indoor air quality
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
and temperature conditions a bill does
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
not require any structural improvements
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
in buildings or expense it's just a
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
first step to require districts to look
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
at what concerns there might be
 
05:27:57.708 --> 05:27:57.718 align:start position:0%
regarding temperature and air quality
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
and what mitigating approaches might be
 
05:28:03.190 --> 05:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
considered I think probably everybody
 
05:28:04.590 --> 05:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
here has personally experienced the
 
05:28:06.590 --> 05:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
challenges of unhealthy warm
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
temperatures distracting from our
 
05:28:10.670 --> 05:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
concentration I know I did that in this
 
05:28:13.070 --> 05:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
very broom last June when the sun was
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
pouring in and it was late afternoon and
 
05:28:17.230 --> 05:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
sort of felt like the brain was
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
cooked similarly an unreasonably cold
 
05:28:21.230 --> 05:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
environment is not compatible with
 
05:28:23.788 --> 05:28:23.798 align:start position:0%
focusing on learning and we know that we
 
05:28:25.708 --> 05:28:25.718 align:start position:0%
have many aging school buildings that
 
05:28:28.548 --> 05:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
were not designed for ventilation for
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
the high temperatures that are
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
increasingly common at the beginning and
 
05:28:34.110 --> 05:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
the end of our Academic Year in
 
05:28:36.910 --> 05:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
September of 23 Stevens High School in
 
05:28:38.470 --> 05:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
Claremont one of the community I
 
05:28:40.990 --> 05:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
represent sent students home at midm
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
morning because the heat index in the
 
05:28:45.470 --> 05:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
building was unsafely high for the third
 
05:28:48.190 --> 05:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
day in a row I think it is likely that
 
05:28:50.470 --> 05:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
if the heat index policy were in place
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
school would have been cancelled for the
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
day not unlike snow days thus saving the
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties of closing abruptly and
 
05:29:00.270 --> 05:29:00.280 align:start position:0%
having students some of them lacking
 
05:29:03.270 --> 05:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
transportation and other
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
challenges this bill will help schools
 
05:29:06.750 --> 05:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
make plans
 
05:29:09.310 --> 05:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
proactively this might partly answer
 
05:29:12.788 --> 05:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
your question the USA sorry US EPA
 
05:29:15.350 --> 05:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
indoor air quality Tools for Schools
 
05:29:18.628 --> 05:29:18.638 align:start position:0%
action kit that's referenced on page two
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
is online you can look it up and find it
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
very very readily um and it is designed
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
it specifically says in the intro to
 
05:29:31.110 --> 05:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
help inove indoor error problems
 
05:29:33.910 --> 05:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
practically at little or no cost saving
 
05:29:36.270 --> 05:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
with straightforward activities and
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
in-house um staff
 
05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
I am not going to say that I read the
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
entire thing I've looked through it and
 
05:29:45.110 --> 05:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated that there are in
 
05:29:47.270 --> 05:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
fact I I would actually characterize
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
some of them as old-fashioned me
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
measures I think about my mom being very
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
conscious of you draw the shades or
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
blinds or whatever window covering you
 
05:29:58.430 --> 05:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
have on the west side and the South Side
 
05:30:02.070 --> 05:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
midafternoon and you open up windows at
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
night and let the cooler evening air
 
05:30:06.670 --> 05:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
come in and I realized for security
 
05:30:07.750 --> 05:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to open the windows on
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
the ground floor of a school but for
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
instance Steven's High School is three
 
05:30:13.708 --> 05:30:13.718 align:start position:0%
stories tall you probably could leave
 
05:30:16.548 --> 05:30:16.558 align:start position:0%
the third floor windows open partly and
 
05:30:19.548 --> 05:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
let cool air come in no cost no risk or
 
05:30:22.510 --> 05:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
little so just it's not all that simple
 
05:30:24.190 --> 05:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
but there are some simple measures that
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
we could kind of get more um focus
 
05:30:33.390 --> 05:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
on and I also will just call out from
 
05:30:35.868 --> 05:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
the um indoor air quality Tools for
 
05:30:39.150 --> 05:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
Schools kit they specifically comment
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
that teachers can involve students and
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
teach them about environmental
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
principles when applying and they're
 
05:30:46.270 --> 05:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
talking about applying things indoors
 
05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
and out this bill is only about indoors
 
05:30:50.990 --> 05:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
but I like that focus of saying well as
 
05:30:52.948 --> 05:30:52.958 align:start position:0%
we explore what's going on in our school
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to temperature and air
 
05:30:55.750 --> 05:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
quality let's make it a learning
 
05:30:58.548 --> 05:30:58.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students as well and
 
05:31:01.750 --> 05:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
then finally just to note it's not just
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
about Comfort it's about health
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
productivity and that we really should
 
05:31:08.990 --> 05:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
be creating an environment in which kids
 
05:31:10.110 --> 05:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
can do their best
 
05:31:17.070 --> 05:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:21.190 --> 05:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
questions see representative
 
05:31:23.670 --> 05:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
dry thank
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
taking this question so we've been
 
05:31:30.590 --> 05:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
looking at aeds and EP pens in the last
 
05:31:33.548 --> 05:31:33.558 align:start position:0%
couple of um sessions and with an
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
emergency action plan for those kind of
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
things because there's medical
 
05:31:38.430 --> 05:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
emergencies but they have tools
 
05:31:41.110 --> 05:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
that we want to have available to use I
 
05:31:43.430 --> 05:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't really recall any tools for heat
 
05:31:45.548 --> 05:31:45.558 align:start position:0%
illness emergencies and an emergency
 
05:31:47.070 --> 05:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
action plan so I'm wondering what that
 
05:31:48.230 --> 05:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
would look
 
05:31:50.548 --> 05:31:50.558 align:start position:0%
like thank you for the question it's an
 
05:31:50.558 --> 05:31:52.270 align:start position:0%
like thank you for the question it's an
excellent

05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
question my thinking
 
05:31:58.628 --> 05:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
about um prevention of heat illness went
 
05:32:00.948 --> 05:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
along the lines of educating and
 
05:32:02.708 --> 05:32:02.718 align:start position:0%
communicating about
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
hydration about layered or lighter
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
weight clothing lighter or heavier as
 
05:32:10.948 --> 05:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate I frankly find it amazing
 
05:32:10.958 --> 05:32:12.150 align:start position:0%
appropriate I frankly find it amazing
how

05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:32:12.160 --> 05:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
how
infrequently

05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
infrequently
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
people adjust their dress to the
 
05:32:18.990 --> 05:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
different environment that they're in I
 
05:32:21.230 --> 05:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
mean to me the same weighty jeans that
 
05:32:22.350 --> 05:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
are comfortable in the middle of the
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
winter are not what I want to be wearing
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
in June um not that we by any means are
 
05:32:28.190 --> 05:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
going to dictate to kids or staff what
 
05:32:30.590 --> 05:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
they should wear but just a nudge hey
 
05:32:31.548 --> 05:32:31.558 align:start position:0%
it's going to be really hot here
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow you know you might think about
 
05:32:35.948 --> 05:32:35.958 align:start position:0%
wearing shorts or a skirt and queuing
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
hydration especially with younger kids
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
as a dietitian I am very aware that
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
thirst is not
 
05:32:46.868 --> 05:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
as um vigorous a sense as the other
 
05:32:49.070 --> 05:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
senses we basically experience thirst
 
05:32:51.190 --> 05:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
when we already should have gotten more
 
05:32:53.708 --> 05:32:53.718 align:start position:0%
hydrated so that could be helpful to
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure there's much more for
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
preventing heat Illness but those are um
 
05:33:00.910 --> 05:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
not tools in the sense of a tangible
 
05:33:03.628 --> 05:33:03.638 align:start position:0%
item thank
 
05:33:06.910 --> 05:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
you questions see none thank you very
 
05:33:06.920 --> 05:33:11.948 align:start position:0%
you questions see none thank you very
much

05:33:11.948 --> 05:33:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.990 --> 05:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:30.628 --> 05:33:30.638 align:start position:0%
Tuttle thank you Mr chair is it okay if
 
05:33:33.110 --> 05:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
um Brian Hawkins is with me thank you um
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
so chairman uh cordelli members of one
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the House Education committees from
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Megan tutle I'm
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
president of Nea New Hampshire we
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
represent about 17,000 Educators across
 
05:33:44.708 --> 05:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I do say Educators
 
05:33:46.868 --> 05:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
because we represent teachers and any
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
number of the ESP the education support
 
05:33:51.788 --> 05:33:51.798 align:start position:0%
professionals across um I'm an 18year
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
veteran e8th grade social studies
 
05:33:55.190 --> 05:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
teacher and I do have three children in
 
05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
the conquered School District in public
 
05:33:58.030 --> 05:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
schools and this is all relevant to the
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm about to give I will um
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
submit my written testimony online
 
05:34:03.868 --> 05:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
because there are some links to some
 
05:34:06.430 --> 05:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
studies and if we did it in you know
 
05:34:07.948 --> 05:34:07.958 align:start position:0%
paper format there would be almost a
 
05:34:09.390 --> 05:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
book so that'll be submitted this
 
05:34:10.510 --> 05:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon for you and you can click on
 
05:34:12.788 --> 05:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
the links to the different studies um
 
05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
I'll keep this short
 
05:34:17.070 --> 05:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
basically you know as the um
 
05:34:18.868 --> 05:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan said before this
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
is the start of a conversation two years
 
05:34:23.708 --> 05:34:23.718 align:start position:0%
ago September of 2023 is when this
 
05:34:26.070 --> 05:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
really first started that week there was
 
05:34:27.430 --> 05:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
that one week of school the temperatures
 
05:34:30.270 --> 05:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
were horrific it was 90 plus every day
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
humidity it was it was awful
 
05:34:35.830 --> 05:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
um nobody's learning in that environment
 
05:34:36.990 --> 05:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
nobody's teaching in that environment
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
nobody's learning that uh conquered
 
05:34:40.590 --> 05:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
actually had a couple other situations
 
05:34:42.150 --> 05:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
that were going on at the same time the
 
05:34:45.190 --> 05:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
water had uh high levels of lead so the
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
water bubblers and the schools weren't
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
working at the same time so it was kind
 
05:34:49.670 --> 05:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
of this huge you know just perfect storm
 
05:34:50.830 --> 05:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
of everything that was happening that
 
05:34:52.708 --> 05:34:52.718 align:start position:0%
week that wasn't good so we're in full
 
05:34:57.708 --> 05:34:57.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:59.868 --> 05:34:59.878 align:start position:0%
329 sorry I'm just looking through this
 
05:35:02.590 --> 05:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't just last year we had
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
instances this year as well where in the
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school year the
 
05:35:08.708 --> 05:35:08.718 align:start position:0%
temperatures were reaching 80 859 de I
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
do want to point out you know as uh
 
05:35:12.910 --> 05:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative Damon said nobody is
 
05:35:14.590 --> 05:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable in those situations nobody's
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable in those temperatures hot or
 
05:35:18.150 --> 05:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
cold last year I think it was in
 
05:35:19.590 --> 05:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
September the same week the House and
 
05:35:21.230 --> 05:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
Senate actually shut down because the
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
air conditioning broke so we weren't wen
 
05:35:25.590 --> 05:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
at work here you weren't at work here um
 
05:35:28.190 --> 05:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
if you were here in that uh that week
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
but the teachers the Educators support
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
staff students were all still in school
 
05:35:34.750 --> 05:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
and that's just really not a good way um
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
for children to be learning teachers to
 
05:35:38.470 --> 05:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
be in the schools
 
05:35:41.470 --> 05:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
other states have um implemented and
 
05:35:44.350 --> 05:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
enacted laws that are much more strict
 
05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
than what this is asking for just a
 
05:35:48.470 --> 05:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
policy other states uh New York is one
 
05:35:49.708 --> 05:35:49.718 align:start position:0%
that is implemented where they actually
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
have some ranges of the temperature so
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
the classrooms have to be between
 
05:35:54.670 --> 05:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
certain temperatures we're looking
 
05:35:56.350 --> 05:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
really for this to start the
 
05:35:58.110 --> 05:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
conversation and let the districts come
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
up with what their policy will be we do
 
05:36:02.110 --> 05:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
know that every District's different we
 
05:36:03.868 --> 05:36:03.878 align:start position:0%
know that even within one District
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
conquer for example some of the schools
 
05:36:07.628 --> 05:36:07.638 align:start position:0%
are much newer some are older and we
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of the school buildings
 
05:36:11.628 --> 05:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um they're aged and so
 
05:36:12.708 --> 05:36:12.718 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that has to be
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
done for different reasons but the air
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
quality and the temperature really needs
 
05:36:18.750 --> 05:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
um to be addressed this is it's it's
 
05:36:22.470 --> 05:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
just not good um it's not just the heat
 
05:36:24.430 --> 05:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
in runlet Middle School a few weeks ago
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
I had an email from one of my son's
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
teachers telling me that it was going to
 
05:36:28.830 --> 05:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
be hot in his classroom they were fixing
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
the heat and so I thought okay you know
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
an email went out this is fine so I
 
05:36:33.670 --> 05:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
picked up my son from school how was
 
05:36:35.270 --> 05:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
school today I was asking questions and
 
05:36:37.350 --> 05:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
he said oh you know so and so's class it
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
was really hot I said yeah we got the we
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
got the email we knew it was going to be
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
really hot because of the heat he said
 
05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah but then I went to the next
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
classroom it was 57° so even within one
 
05:36:48.190 --> 05:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
build yeah 57 to sit and learn um and so
 
05:36:50.150 --> 05:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
even taking layers off adding layers I
 
05:36:52.430 --> 05:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
mean this was in the month of December
 
05:36:53.788 --> 05:36:53.798 align:start position:0%
so this wasn't even in the beginning of
 
05:36:55.390 --> 05:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
the school year from outside yes it was
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
something that was happening but the
 
05:36:58.110 --> 05:36:58.120 align:start position:0%
temperature in the classroom was still
 
05:37:01.270 --> 05:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
80 in one and 57 in another um in Berlin
 
05:37:03.390 --> 05:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
last year the heat wasn't working in one
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
part of the high school and so they
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
blasted the Heat and then they just put
 
05:37:08.390 --> 05:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
fans in to say let's try and get heat in
 
05:37:09.470 --> 05:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
the other half of the building that
 
05:37:11.470 --> 05:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the ideal way to learn in any
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
school it's not the ideal place to work
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
and if we think about students you know
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
their job is to go to school and learn
 
05:37:18.070 --> 05:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
not a good environment for them um so
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're really looking to get this
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
starting to get this talked about um so
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we can make sure that you know any
 
05:37:25.788 --> 05:37:25.798 align:start position:0%
student who's going to school does have
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
those ideal conditions and it's a
 
05:37:28.830 --> 05:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
starting point right we're not looking
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
for those ex you had mentioned the bill
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
from last year um that was more strict
 
05:37:34.590 --> 05:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
than this one um it did have some
 
05:37:36.070 --> 05:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
parameters on it that we don't have in
 
05:37:38.830 --> 05:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
this one so that's the between the two
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
um and I think this one you know I think
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple to be honest um so
 
05:37:45.230 --> 05:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's what I have I can take any
 
05:37:46.830 --> 05:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions but I also have Brian Hawkins
 
05:37:47.910 --> 05:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
here he's the government relations
 
05:37:49.948 --> 05:37:49.958 align:start position:0%
director for any New Hampshire um to
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
either add anything or to answer
 
05:37:54.590 --> 05:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:57.430 --> 05:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
me the only thing I would add is just to
 
05:38:00.510 --> 05:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
add to uh president T's response to
 
05:38:02.350 --> 05:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative Terry's question which is
 
05:38:04.670 --> 05:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
last year the uh Bill actually
 
05:38:08.150 --> 05:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
specifically prescribed uh
 
05:38:08.160 --> 05:38:09.708 align:start position:0%
specifically prescribed uh
fahrenheit

05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
fahrenheit
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
temperatures uh in the bill obviously
 
05:38:16.590 --> 05:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
this does not um and so uh just just as
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
an example of uh this not being as
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
prescriptive as the bill that you saw
 
05:38:26.270 --> 05:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:38:30.070 --> 05:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
so yes represent M thank you Mr chairman
 
05:38:32.590 --> 05:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um so
 
05:38:35.430 --> 05:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
on the last page where it talks about uh
 
05:38:39.468 --> 05:38:39.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
of of the program Tools for Schools um
 
05:38:47.230 --> 05:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
is there does that require action I mean
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
is it sounds like that would be
 
05:38:50.788 --> 05:38:50.798 align:start position:0%
something that would make requirements
 
05:38:52.548 --> 05:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
not just kind of think about but
 
05:38:54.270 --> 05:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
actually do do you know what they'd have
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:59.868 --> 05:38:59.878 align:start position:0%
do well so for example I think
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative Damon touched on this a
 
05:39:04.910 --> 05:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
little bit I mean uh the the toolkit has
 
05:39:08.190 --> 05:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
different um AIDS depending on what your
 
05:39:10.510 --> 05:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
role in the school Community is so if
 
05:39:12.070 --> 05:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
you're an administrator if you're a
 
05:39:15.628 --> 05:39:15.638 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher um some of it is uh
 
05:39:20.510 --> 05:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
related to the uh par excuse me um the
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
part of the current statute uh relative
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
to the investigation of air quality
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's done in each building um so a
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
good example I think in the in the tools
 
05:39:31.868 --> 05:39:31.878 align:start position:0%
for schools program is what's the
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
checklist of things that you're going
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
through when you're looking specifically
 
05:39:39.070 --> 05:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
at temperature and not just you know uh
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
General air quality um and so um and I
 
05:39:45.190 --> 05:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
think as representative Sullivan said in
 
05:39:49.590 --> 05:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
his um introduction of the bill um
 
05:39:51.670 --> 05:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
having a deliberate approach to looking
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
at those things that won't necessarily
 
05:39:57.390 --> 05:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
be a cost item to you know there there
 
05:40:02.190 --> 05:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
are different uh approaches to that can
 
05:40:04.750 --> 05:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
that can make significant impact on you
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
know the temperature in Building
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
represent David mentioned a few of them
 
05:40:11.310 --> 05:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
shading um and and really having the
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
sort of proactive mitigation strategies
 
05:40:19.070 --> 05:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
um which can go a long way to
 
05:40:19.080 --> 05:40:20.750 align:start position:0%
um which can go a long way to
avoiding

05:40:20.750 --> 05:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
avoiding
 
05:40:23.628 --> 05:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
um these kinds of conditions short of
 
05:40:25.788 --> 05:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
you know installing an air conditioning
 
05:40:28.510 --> 05:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
system where there wasn't one before um
 
05:40:30.948 --> 05:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
and and we're
 
05:40:34.628 --> 05:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh we'd be happy to provide the
 
05:40:36.750 --> 05:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
complete link to the toolkit to the
 
05:40:38.510 --> 05:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee as as well so you can look at
 
05:40:40.868 --> 05:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
all of the recommendations that they
 
05:40:43.830 --> 05:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
have I ask a followup followup yes okay
 
05:40:46.230 --> 05:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
so and I'm just looking it it's because
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's required that's big that's a big
 
05:40:51.708 --> 05:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
word to me implementing it it it looks
 
05:40:52.990 --> 05:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
like the department of Ed is then
 
05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure people know
 
05:40:57.190 --> 05:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
it and then there's immunity if you did
 
05:41:01.230 --> 05:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
a good faith effort in it is that
 
05:41:05.830 --> 05:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
correct yes so this uh current statute
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
um uh I not sure why originally it was
 
05:41:08.878 --> 05:41:09.708 align:start position:0%
um uh I not sure why originally it was
just

05:41:09.708 --> 05:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:41:12.510 --> 05:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
encourage um because I think as
 
05:41:14.070 --> 05:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative D said I think there's a
 
05:41:17.788 --> 05:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
lot of common sense items in this um and
 
05:41:20.628 --> 05:41:20.638 align:start position:0%
as we said school districts um are going
 
05:41:24.030 --> 05:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh Implement these in in
 
05:41:26.590 --> 05:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
different ways um so not all the the
 
05:41:28.788 --> 05:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
toolkit plan is you must do this you
 
05:41:31.310 --> 05:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
must do this you must do this is uh here
 
05:41:34.990 --> 05:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
are the things that you need to uh uh
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
look at when you're considering um you
 
05:41:41.350 --> 05:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
know uh areas areas of the building for
 
05:41:42.910 --> 05:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
example there are going to be problem
 
05:41:46.750 --> 05:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
you know problems for um extreme heat
 
05:41:49.350 --> 05:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
one more yes okay and I just want to
 
05:41:50.708 --> 05:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
make sure because we're writing this
 
05:41:54.750 --> 05:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
down is if you're requiring it and the
 
05:41:56.670 --> 05:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
department of Ed notifies them about it
 
05:41:58.590 --> 05:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
is the Department of Ed responsible for
 
05:42:00.868 --> 05:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
making sure that people are doing
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
this uh they uh as as I read it they are
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
05:42:13.468 --> 05:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
uh notifying them um and
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh I would think that there would have
 
05:42:18.030 --> 05:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be a submission of the plan that the
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
school has in order to um uh confirm
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that they are um are implementing the
 
05:42:26.160 --> 05:42:28.750 align:start position:0%
that they are um are implementing the
the

05:42:28.750 --> 05:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:32.830 --> 05:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
plan represent Terry so with respect to
 
05:42:35.590 --> 05:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
um last year's bill but also with
 
05:42:37.190 --> 05:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
respect to this year's Bill and you've
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
describe the the differences between the
 
05:42:43.390 --> 05:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
two um is is it the view of your your
 
05:42:48.990 --> 05:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
members that this legislation would be
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
be helpful in the sense that it would uh
 
05:42:56.270 --> 05:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
move forward concerns and uh goals that
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
they have that they
 
05:43:01.830 --> 05:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
cannot um Advance at this time because
 
05:43:04.868 --> 05:43:04.878 align:start position:0%
of certain constraints financial and and
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise and that that in effect they
 
05:43:10.110 --> 05:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
need need a nudge let's say from U the
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
state by way of state law in order to be
 
05:43:15.150 --> 05:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
able to make the schools a safer place
 
05:43:17.110 --> 05:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
let me just give the rehearse back to
 
05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
the example of the school I think it was
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh the representative Damon site in
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
Claremont where um the forecast no doubt
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
was was going to be a very very hot day
 
05:43:29.948 --> 05:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
um the the students the teachers the
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
staff came in in the morning it it was
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
um virtually close to unbearable at that
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
time but so unbearable that they were
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
sent home uh at um at the noon time at
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
midday um is your sense that for example
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
in with with respect to that example
 
05:43:49.350 --> 05:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
that the school
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
administrators I I don't know about the
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
teachers if if they had a vote but is it
 
05:43:55.468 --> 05:43:55.478 align:start position:0%
your sense that they that they felt that
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
they had to do that but they would have
 
05:44:00.990 --> 05:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
preferred not to do that and didn't have
 
05:44:02.708 --> 05:44:02.718 align:start position:0%
the power to be able to say we're not
 
05:44:04.350 --> 05:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
going to come in today because the
 
05:44:07.150 --> 05:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
forecast is because I I can remember you
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
years about about uh want to go on the
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
way back machine that school was called
 
05:44:15.510 --> 05:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
off because um it was flurrying in the
 
05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
morning but the forecast was that by
 
05:44:19.788 --> 05:44:19.798 align:start position:0%
midday there were going to be 4 to 6
 
05:44:22.548 --> 05:44:22.558 align:start position:0%
inches of snow and more by time 3:00
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
rolled around so the administrators took
 
05:44:26.590 --> 05:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
the made the decision we're not going to
 
05:44:29.030 --> 05:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
have school today but now we have a
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
school that brings the staff and the
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
students in uh and and and they know
 
05:44:35.270 --> 05:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
from the forecast that it's going to be
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
unbearable by midday and have to send
 
05:44:39.788 --> 05:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
everybody home um so they've wasted half
 
05:44:43.030 --> 05:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
a day they've lost half a day when it
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
probably would have been more prudent
 
05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
for them to call off school but that
 
05:44:47.310 --> 05:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
they felt that they needed to do that
 
05:44:50.190 --> 05:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
anyway and now we need whereas in my day
 
05:44:52.590 --> 05:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
the the superintendent had enough sense
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
to so we say make the decision we're not
 
05:44:56.750 --> 05:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
going to have school today but now we
 
05:44:58.868 --> 05:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
have administrators who are saying no we
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
need the state to help us do that and
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
the question is now we need the state to
 
05:45:05.788 --> 05:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
help us do that uh thank you for the
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
question we state law
 
05:45:08.910 --> 05:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that yeah at the beginning
 
05:45:09.830 --> 05:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
of the question you had asked about the
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
members and I can only speak about what
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
my members can tell me I can't speak for
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
the superintendent um I do think this is
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
going to help and the the questions
 
05:45:19.230 --> 05:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
concerns pictures I'm getting from my
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
members is that even early in the
 
05:45:23.430 --> 05:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
morning on some of those mornings the
 
05:45:25.190 --> 05:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
temperature was already 70 something in
 
05:45:26.590 --> 05:45:26.600 align:start position:0%
their classrooms and so we have pictures
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
from last year I have some pictures from
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
this year of classroom temperatures of
 
05:45:31.510 --> 05:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the thermometers in the classrooms
 
05:45:33.430 --> 05:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
so for my members yes I definitely think
 
05:45:36.468 --> 05:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
this would help because um it would it
 
05:45:38.110 --> 05:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
would be already set there would be
 
05:45:39.430 --> 05:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
something that was already there for
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
them to know what would happen um and I
 
05:45:43.390 --> 05:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
think that little nudge as you pushed as
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
you put it would definitely help um you
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that was brought
 
05:45:49.468 --> 05:45:49.478 align:start position:0%
up last year in the testimony for this
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
for the bill last year was we'll just
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
have the teachers get fans okay I taught
 
05:45:56.070 --> 05:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
18 years in the classroom and I bought
 
05:45:59.590 --> 05:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
fans and it's still hot I mean at that
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
point when we're when we're dealing with
 
05:46:01.670 --> 05:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
the temp I'm not just talking about a
 
05:46:03.350 --> 05:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
regular hot day right 70 degrees is
 
05:46:05.310 --> 05:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
still hot out but you can manage that a
 
05:46:06.510 --> 05:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
little better if you put fans in the
 
05:46:08.628 --> 05:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
morning blow the cold air in it's not as
 
05:46:10.910 --> 05:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
bad when we're talking about 70
 
05:46:12.230 --> 05:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
something in the morning before you even
 
05:46:13.788 --> 05:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
get into the classroom and you try to
 
05:46:15.390 --> 05:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
put the fans in all you're really doing
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
I apologize all you're really doing is
 
05:46:18.430 --> 05:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
blowing that hot air around and it's not
 
05:46:20.110 --> 05:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
doing anything so by the time eth period
 
05:46:21.670 --> 05:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
comes around and again I taught eighth
 
05:46:23.670 --> 05:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
grade so you have kids coming up after
 
05:46:25.350 --> 05:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
gym class I mean you can imagine you hit
 
05:46:26.910 --> 05:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
the second floor going up the stairs
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
there's a spot where the air just
 
05:46:30.510 --> 05:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
becomes so thick so stifling you can't
 
05:46:32.548 --> 05:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
even breathe in it and then you add in
 
05:46:34.468 --> 05:46:34.478 align:start position:0%
all those children coming in from other
 
05:46:37.788 --> 05:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
classes Etc um I do think that this bill
 
05:46:40.468 --> 05:46:40.478 align:start position:0%
and then potential future ones will help
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
that and and my members do want this um
 
05:46:45.990 --> 05:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know they they they want something
 
05:46:48.430 --> 05:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
that is going to give them that you know
 
05:46:50.110 --> 05:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
assurance that we're not going to be
 
05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
having to work in 90degree classrooms
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:59.670 --> 05:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
point repr Murray um thank you Mr chair
 
05:47:00.990 --> 05:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
05:47:02.670 --> 05:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure should a distri
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
district already be exploring these
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
issues have gone down this road to sort
 
05:47:09.830 --> 05:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
of develop these action plans that would
 
05:47:12.110 --> 05:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
not this would not uh require them to
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
start at zero correct they could
 
05:47:16.830 --> 05:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they have already
 
05:47:18.708 --> 05:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
proceeded so far or can you explain to
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
me how that might work if someone's
 
05:47:21.708 --> 05:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
already down that path yeah thank you
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
for the question and um I don't if Brian
 
05:47:27.390 --> 05:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
want yeah I can start it um my
 
05:47:28.750 --> 05:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes they would continue
 
05:47:30.190 --> 05:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
down what they're doing if it's not a
 
05:47:31.990 --> 05:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
formalized policy then I think this
 
05:47:33.468 --> 05:47:33.478 align:start position:0%
would just have them write it down into
 
05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
a formal policy um and and you know the
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
good thing or what I like about the way
 
05:47:39.628 --> 05:47:39.638 align:start position:0%
this is written is that we know that
 
05:47:41.310 --> 05:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
there are schools who are already are
 
05:47:42.788 --> 05:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
already looking at things we know that
 
05:47:44.110 --> 05:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
there are schools that yeah some of the
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
classrooms do already have air
 
05:47:46.430 --> 05:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
conditioning because they're either
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
facing a certain direction and they know
 
05:47:49.948 --> 05:47:49.958 align:start position:0%
the Sun comes in it's a science lab they
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
need you know whatever it is um but this
 
05:47:53.830 --> 05:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
would allow all the other ones that are
 
05:47:55.830 --> 05:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
not doing that yet to make those plans
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
or to make those policies um and it does
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
let it be catered to that District in
 
05:48:03.030 --> 05:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
that school within a district if they're
 
05:48:07.708 --> 05:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
different yeah okay thank you
 
05:48:09.510 --> 05:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you
 
05:48:12.830 --> 05:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon afternoon maybe
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
we see you four as well
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
um my question deals with the the timing
 
05:48:22.430 --> 05:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
um having been when I moved to New
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the person called
 
05:48:27.468 --> 05:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
design uh and that design application
 
05:48:29.230 --> 05:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
typically happened after school was out
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
the youngsters were gone in the summer
 
05:48:34.468 --> 05:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
um when we had air quality issues uh
 
05:48:37.468 --> 05:48:37.478 align:start position:0%
like a a surprising amount of faculty or
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
youngsters out of the building and C all
 
05:48:42.350 --> 05:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
the same time we buy if the union
 
05:48:45.150 --> 05:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
intervened we typically do a air quality
 
05:48:46.990 --> 05:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
they' calling people but pretty much
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
based on the union saying you know soon
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
people are sick forget the kid soon
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
people are sick um and then by the time
 
05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
they getting to be done already that
 
05:48:57.750 --> 05:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
issue dissipated so I'm looking at this
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
as and I'm not suggesting this is bad
 
05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting that the the timing when
 
05:49:07.070 --> 05:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's June and the teachers are gone the
 
05:49:09.510 --> 05:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
students are gone the staff are gone the
 
05:49:11.230 --> 05:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
kitchen's open everything's all nice and
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
clean the windows are open and we do our
 
05:49:16.830 --> 05:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
design check so I just that's the the
 
05:49:19.830 --> 05:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
reality of that is is what I find is is
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
I don't understand what we're doing here
 
05:49:23.070 --> 05:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
I know represent Lad last year when
 
05:49:23.910 --> 05:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're talking the building
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
construction of all the new pieces you
 
05:49:28.350 --> 05:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
know that looking the forward and the
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
hearing applications all those things
 
05:49:31.750 --> 05:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
but in our old buildings even new
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
building we have now um that that's the
 
05:49:37.270 --> 05:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
part that that that concerns me that we
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
check the a when it's the perfect time
 
05:49:42.270 --> 05:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if you find that your
 
05:49:43.468 --> 05:49:43.478 align:start position:0%
school districts the districts you
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
worked in I just know when I was
 
05:49:46.670 --> 05:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
designated that's when we did
 
05:49:50.670 --> 05:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:52.430 --> 05:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
annual yeah no thank you for the
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
question I I honestly don't know when
 
05:49:55.590 --> 05:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
they did it in the school the two
 
05:49:57.070 --> 05:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
schools that I worked at it wasn't
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
something that Administration came to
 
05:50:00.708 --> 05:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
the teachers for anything for that I was
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
part of so
 
05:50:06.910 --> 05:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Lichfield thank
 
05:50:09.788 --> 05:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:50:11.548 --> 05:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand why we're I
 
05:50:13.390 --> 05:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a worthy cause but working
 
05:50:16.830 --> 05:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
from the top down at the local level has
 
05:50:19.310 --> 05:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
this been presented um pretty frequently
 
05:50:20.830 --> 05:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
to school boards and they're not
 
05:50:23.430 --> 05:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
addressing it and or during contract
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations have the conditions adverse
 
05:50:29.670 --> 05:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
conditions been brought up and not
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you for the question um
 
05:50:35.548 --> 05:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
we're not always in favor of top down um
 
05:50:37.708 --> 05:50:37.718 align:start position:0%
but for something like this I think it
 
05:50:40.430 --> 05:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
almost has to be because if we leave it
 
05:50:42.708 --> 05:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
um up to the local to do something or
 
05:50:45.468 --> 05:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
not do something the chance is they
 
05:50:47.548 --> 05:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
won't always do something um with
 
05:50:49.468 --> 05:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
negotiations it's it would have to be
 
05:50:52.430 --> 05:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
negotiated obviously right so it might
 
05:50:54.830 --> 05:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
not end up going through and so the the
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
chance is greater that you're still
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
going to have some schools that are
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
having temperatures this high or that
 
05:51:01.750 --> 05:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
low right because you know part of this
 
05:51:03.310 --> 05:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
isn't just the the extreme temperature
 
05:51:05.110 --> 05:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
of the the heat we're also talking about
 
05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
the cold um and so that's why I do think
 
05:51:08.910 --> 05:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
this one should be topped down just so
 
05:51:11.670 --> 05:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
everywhere well and just just that as
 
05:51:16.548 --> 05:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
I'm sure these are learning conditions
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
for students and so if we're if we're
 
05:51:22.708 --> 05:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
talking about having you know this be a
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
com a component that every school
 
05:51:26.350 --> 05:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
district looks at as far as having a
 
05:51:28.750 --> 05:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
plan around these issues um it shouldn't
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
be just for Berlin it should be for
 
05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
conquer and exer and all the towns in in
 
05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:38.120 align:start position:0%

05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
for the record Becky Wilson of the New
 
05:52:10.110 --> 05:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association um
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to this bill the way that
 
05:52:14.830 --> 05:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
it is currently written um a similar
 
05:52:16.390 --> 05:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill I think this was mentioned was
 
05:52:17.830 --> 05:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
brought last year that did not move
 
05:52:20.030 --> 05:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
forward we certainly appreciate the
 
05:52:21.548 --> 05:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
changes that have been made to this
 
05:52:23.510 --> 05:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and some of the
 
05:52:24.868 --> 05:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been tried to be
 
05:52:26.230 --> 05:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
addressed however we still have some
 
05:52:27.868 --> 05:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
further concerns and would like to seek
 
05:52:31.350 --> 05:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
out some clarification with this bill um
 
05:52:33.430 --> 05:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
as stated in previous testimony about
 
05:52:36.468 --> 05:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
this bill uh last session decisions
 
05:52:38.110 --> 05:52:38.120 align:start position:0%
regarding temperature conditions and
 
05:52:40.230 --> 05:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
school buildings whether it's too hot or
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
too cold are currently left to District
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
admin uh and board's best judgment uh we
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
don't see a need for a specific
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard policy to address this
 
05:52:51.230 --> 05:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
concern we do see districts already
 
05:52:53.830 --> 05:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
currently balancing multiple needs uh
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
student needs staff needs the current
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
conditions of their buildings these can
 
05:53:01.190 --> 05:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
be difficult decisions and then while we
 
05:53:03.230 --> 05:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
realize that bringing the kids to school
 
05:53:05.628 --> 05:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
and then sending them home 2 hours later
 
05:53:07.230 --> 05:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know in hindsight potentially was
 
05:53:09.070 --> 05:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
not the best decision uh District
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
administration and school boards are
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
making the best decisions given the
 
05:53:13.708 --> 05:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
information they have in those
 
05:53:17.510 --> 05:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
situations there are some temperature um
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
issues that could come up in a school
 
05:53:20.830 --> 05:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
that could not be predicted necessarily
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
simply just based off of the weather and
 
05:53:24.708 --> 05:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
I think school boards and Local District
 
05:53:26.468 --> 05:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
admin are having these
 
05:53:28.990 --> 05:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
conversations um we also would like to
 
05:53:30.628 --> 05:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the state of some of our
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
education spaces within our buildings
 
05:53:35.070 --> 05:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
and our build their buildings themselves
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
um as you have here heard often in this
 
05:53:42.190 --> 05:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
room building um needs are far and many
 
05:53:44.110 --> 05:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
across the State Building Aid is at a
 
05:53:46.230 --> 05:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
premium uh we have a lot of older
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
buildings some districts may not be able
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
to fund the changes that some of the
 
05:53:51.990 --> 05:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
mandates in this bill seem like they
 
05:53:54.750 --> 05:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
could require uh as it stands now we
 
05:53:56.350 --> 05:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
already have districts that are making
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
adjustments to their day and to their
 
05:54:00.830 --> 05:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
spaces based on uh the current
 
05:54:02.350 --> 05:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
conditions of their buildings that they
 
05:54:04.708 --> 05:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
may or may not be able to mitigate uh
 
05:54:06.628 --> 05:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
with larger changes to the actual
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
construction of their buildings we do
 
05:54:11.150 --> 05:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
have concerns about lines 11 to13 about
 
05:54:12.910 --> 05:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
the heat illness prevention and
 
05:54:15.868 --> 05:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
emergency response plan and mandating
 
05:54:17.830 --> 05:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
training to School Employees on how to
 
05:54:20.190 --> 05:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
carry out the plan we certainly want to
 
05:54:22.350 --> 05:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
prioritize student staff and safety
 
05:54:24.628 --> 05:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
however this is just another mandatory
 
05:54:26.788 --> 05:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
training that's going to be put onto the
 
05:54:28.510 --> 05:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
list of mandatory trainings that need to
 
05:54:31.150 --> 05:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
be provided to all School staff uh the
 
05:54:33.110 --> 05:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
way we read this bill it really would be
 
05:54:35.150 --> 05:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
all staff not just Educators or
 
05:54:37.350 --> 05:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
classroom teachers I'm not sure when
 
05:54:39.150 --> 05:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
that training would need to occur it
 
05:54:41.150 --> 05:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
could in mean that there would be more
 
05:54:42.670 --> 05:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
professional development time that is
 
05:54:46.590 --> 05:54:46.600 align:start position:0%
needed or contract um negotiations in
 
05:54:49.430 --> 05:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
terms of adding time to teachers
 
05:54:51.948 --> 05:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
schedules to be able to have this
 
05:54:55.548 --> 05:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
training um and lastly the this last
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
section of the bill uh sections two um
 
05:55:01.948 --> 05:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
in terms of encou moving from
 
05:55:04.230 --> 05:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
encouraging to requiring public schools
 
05:55:07.310 --> 05:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
to implement this um United States EPA
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
Tools for Schools this is a program
 
05:55:11.830 --> 05:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's readily available online however
 
05:55:14.350 --> 05:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
it's 98 pages and in all honesty I have
 
05:55:17.310 --> 05:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
not read it completely but it is unclear
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
as to what if any costs would be
 
05:55:20.590 --> 05:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the Department of Ed
 
05:55:22.948 --> 05:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
requiring school districts to comply
 
05:55:25.270 --> 05:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
with this um we would respectfully ask
 
05:55:26.990 --> 05:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
that any costs that could occur as part
 
05:55:29.468 --> 05:55:29.478 align:start position:0%
of this mandated participation be funded
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
by the state and not fall on the back of
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh local taxpayers as an unfunded
 
05:55:37.868 --> 05:55:37.878 align:start position:0%
mandate I'm happy to take any questions
 
05:55:37.878 --> 05:55:39.310 align:start position:0%
mandate I'm happy to take any questions
any

05:55:39.310 --> 05:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
05:55:53.868 --> 05:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
entry thank you Mr chairman I will uh
 
05:55:59.830 --> 05:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
keep it very brief uh the hour and uh
 
05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're all ready to go home uh Jerry FW
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
associate executive director nhsaa
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
um and I had not planned to speak but uh
 
05:56:11.350 --> 05:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
when representative Terry invoked the
 
05:56:14.070 --> 05:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent's name I just said Pro
 
05:56:16.910 --> 05:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
probably better answer the question um
 
05:56:18.150 --> 05:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question although
 
05:56:20.948 --> 05:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
it was indirect representative um but
 
05:56:22.430 --> 05:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
the answer to answer to your question
 
05:56:23.910 --> 05:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
the superintendants don't need a state
 
05:56:25.708 --> 05:56:25.718 align:start position:0%
law to determine snow days and delayed
 
05:56:29.070 --> 05:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
openings so uh I think that we dealt
 
05:56:31.788 --> 05:56:31.798 align:start position:0%
with uh weather situations for a long
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
time with heat and cold and whatnot and
 
05:56:36.750 --> 05:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
that it's not a perfect science and and
 
05:56:39.590 --> 05:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
commend the uh introdu introduction of
 
05:56:41.868 --> 05:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
this particular bill which is much less
 
05:56:44.070 --> 05:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
prescriptive than last year we literally
 
05:56:46.030 --> 05:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
had superintendant anticipating that
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
bill running around in classrooms with
 
05:56:51.350 --> 05:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
thermometers trying to determine uh
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
whether they would have to be cancelling
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
school or not if that's a good use of a
 
05:56:56.750 --> 05:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
superintendent's time it's one more
 
05:57:00.990 --> 05:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
thing they do um but anyway uh you know
 
05:57:03.190 --> 05:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
we do appreciate the the the
 
05:57:05.548 --> 05:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
flexibilities uh of local districts to
 
05:57:07.548 --> 05:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
be able to make these types of decisions
 
05:57:09.590 --> 05:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of uh their
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
children their staffs and um you know
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hudson called off school several years
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
ago at the end of August because it was
 
05:57:19.270 --> 05:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
too hot I think it demonstrates that it
 
05:57:23.030 --> 05:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
can be done um and so I will conclude
 
05:57:26.788 --> 05:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
with that thank you very much any
 
05:57:30.510 --> 05:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you for uh
 
05:57:30.520 --> 05:57:31.628 align:start position:0%
questions I see none thank you for uh
your

05:57:31.628 --> 05:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:57:35.510 --> 05:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh that will close the
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill
 
05:57:42.430 --> 05:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
329 and um as I indicated earlier um
 
05:57:44.948 --> 05:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
I'll Stick Around we have a bill that's
 
05:57:47.070 --> 05:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh scheduled for
 
05:57:51.468 --> 05:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
4:00 um on Constitution Day uh the prime
 
05:57:54.190 --> 05:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
sponsor is um in the midst of a
 
05:57:57.150 --> 05:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
testimony in rep's Hall and the bill is
 
05:58:00.190 --> 05:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
going to be complicated due to a late uh
 
05:58:02.510 --> 05:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just got this morning
 
05:58:05.670 --> 05:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
so I will uh hear any testimony for
 
05:58:08.430 --> 05:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to stick around um and
 
05:58:11.948 --> 05:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
then recess the bill uh to a later date
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
probably the week after
 
05:58:16.990 --> 05:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
next so thank you very much if if you
 
05:58:19.230 --> 05:58:19.240 align:start position:0%
want to leave now and that includes uh
 
05:58:40.788 --> 05:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:40.798 --> 05:59:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
huh

05:59:05.030 --> 05:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
