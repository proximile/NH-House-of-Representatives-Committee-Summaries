00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
technology difficulty could you just
 
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
into the microphone
 
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
say testing testing testing to see if
 
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
we've gotten rid of all the static
 
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay welcome
 
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
your budget is on page 571
 
00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
i believe i already asked you if we
 
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
could post your
 
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
documents and mr hoffman was going to
 
00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 align:start position:0%

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.790 align:start position:0%
so much madam chair and committee
members

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm sarah blodgett
 
00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 align:start position:0%
executive director of the judicial
 
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.910 align:start position:0%
executive director of the judicial
council

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
as i think all of you know of the
 
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
judicial council's responsibilities have
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
evolved quite a bit over the years
 
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
but our core function continues to be
 
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
oversight of the quality and cost
 
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the indigent defense
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
system in new hampshire the council also
 
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
provides for legal and guardian ad litem
 
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
services and child protection cases
 
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it enters into public and private
 
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.910 align:start position:0%
and it enters into public and private
partnerships

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
partnerships
 
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
for civil legal aid our agency has three
 
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
full-time employees including myself
 
00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
and the cost to run our agency is about
 
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
one percent of our overall budget
 
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
and i i apologize for just getting the
 
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
handouts to
 
00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
members um just a few moments ago
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
but if you take a quick look at our
 
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.350 align:start position:0%
but if you take a quick look at our
handouts

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
handouts
 
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
the ones that i'll be referring to most
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
frequently are page three
 
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
which is a history of our expenditures
 
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
and has highlights to indicate the
 
00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs we'll be
 
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
and then a pie chart on page four
 
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
which compares our expenditures in
 
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal 14
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
so that you can see how our costs have
 
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.309 align:start position:0%
so that you can see how our costs have
shifted

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
shifted
 
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
not dramatically certainly um but
 
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
prosper child protection
 
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
um cases have increased and as you can
 
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
see on that pie chart on page four
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
our agency is really a small percentage
 
00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
of our overall appropriation
 
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
many of our expenditures are driven by
 
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.670 align:start position:0%
many of our expenditures are driven by
unpredictable

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
unpredictable
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
and often uncontrollable factors
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
including the number of child protection
 
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
and criminal cases brought by the state
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
all of the programs that we work with
 
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
including the public defender
 
00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 align:start position:0%
casa and new hampshire legal assistance
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
have done an incredible job of providing
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
crucial services
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
during the unprecedented challenges of
 
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
the state's funding for engineering
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
defense fulfills the constitutional
 
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.750 align:start position:0%
defense fulfills the constitutional
requirement

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
to provide representation for indigent
 
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
to provide representation for indigent
defendants

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
defendants
 
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
as you can see on page four those costs
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
have gone down slightly
 
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
from 89 percent to 85
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
in this past fiscal year the number of
 
00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
new criminal cases
 
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 align:start position:0%
has decreased likely as a result of the
 
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.830 align:start position:0%
has decreased likely as a result of the
pandemic

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
we do expect that as things get back to
 
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.229 align:start position:0%
we do expect that as things get back to
normal

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
that those criminal charges will start
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
to go back up
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
to previous levels our child protection
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures have increased more than 50
 
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
expenditures have increased more than 50
percent

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
between 2014 and 2020.
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
again we've seen fewer new cases this
 
00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
we believe that's a result of the
 
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic children not being in school
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
not being in after school programs but
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
anticipating an increase in those cases
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
again when
 
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
things return back to some sense of
 
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.789 align:start position:0%
things return back to some sense of
normalcy

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
we also expecting an increase
 
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
in the number of child protection cases
 
00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.909 align:start position:0%
in the number of child protection cases
brought

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
brought
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
based on some of the factors of the
 
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.510 align:start position:0%
based on some of the factors of the
pandemic

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
increased isolation increased economic
 
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.749 align:start position:0%
increased isolation increased economic
uncertainty

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen over time that these tend
 
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
to lead to
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
more instances of alleged abuse or
 
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
moving to page 571
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
of our budget i don't have
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
have much to say on 1097 our judicial
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
council budget
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
so if there are no questions on that
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
line i'll skip right ahead
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
to the next page and to the assigned
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
counsel line
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
this line pays for the representation of
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
indigent defendants and criminal cases
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
and accuse parents in the child
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
protection cases
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
now over the years the percentage of
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
this overall expenditure has really
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically for the parent
 
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.870 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically for the parent
representation

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal 20 that accounted for 80
 
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal 20 that accounted for 80
percent

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
of our overall expenditures for that
 
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.230 align:start position:0%
of our overall expenditures for that
year

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget maintains level
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
funding at 1.48 million
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 22 and 23.
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
based on recent trends we believe that
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
this will be adequate
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
but i do want to say that this can be a
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
very unpredictable line
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
and factors like the homicide rate
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
especially if there are co-defendants
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
you really have a dramatic increase
 
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
a public defender can only represent one
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
defendant in a homicide and so those
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
costs add up very quickly
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to let members know that
 
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
we're also working with
 
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
dhhs to try to access some federal
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
funding to assist in the parent
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
representation cross
 
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's been a very lengthy process joe

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.029 align:start position:0%
ribson and his team have been incredibly
helpful

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
and we are hopeful that we'll be able to
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
begin drawing down
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
moving on to 1092
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
our guardian ad litem line and the
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
title is doesn't quite encompass
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
everything that
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
happens out of this budget line we pay
 
00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:44.550 align:start position:0%
happens out of this budget line we pay
for

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
guardianships for incapacitated adults
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
and minors out of this line but we're
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
also covering a lot of costs for the
 
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights cases
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
so the parent attorneys who are handling
 
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
so the parent attorneys who are handling
that

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the private guardians at
 
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
as well as the private guardians at
lydom

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
lydom
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
and if you take a look at page three of
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
you get a sense of how those costs have
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
increased really a significant
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
increase in fiscal 16 we are starting
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry that 1091 is the very top
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
item we're starting to see those costs
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
level off but if you go down to the
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
guardian and lighten fund which is
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
really the next step in the child
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
protection process
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
you can see that in fiscal 18 we had a
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
significant increase
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
and that's the child protection cases
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
where there was no reunification
 
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
where there was no reunification
possible

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
and the state has moved forward to
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
again we've seen fewer invoices coming
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
into our office
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year we know that there have
 
00:07:59.680 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year we know that there have
been

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
fewer child protection cases brought and
 
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.110 align:start position:0%
fewer child protection cases brought and
so

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
this number will be going down a bit um
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
are asking for an additional prioritized
 
00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.469 align:start position:0%
are asking for an additional prioritized
need

00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
of 241 950
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
in each year of the biennium
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
these costs have remained um relatively
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
stable with regard to the probate
 
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.270 align:start position:0%
stable with regard to the probate
guardianship

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
guardianship
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
cases but we do expect that as things
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
open up again that the termination costs
 
00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:30.469 align:start position:0%
open up again that the termination costs
may

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
1093 is for the contract attorneys
 
00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
1093 is for the contract attorneys
program

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the contract attorneys are the
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
statutory backup to the public defender
 
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
statutory backup to the public defender
program

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
they handle about 14 of the indigent
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
defense caseload
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
and all of our contract attorneys are
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
approved by the indigenous defense
 
00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
approved by the indigenous defense
subcommittee

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
these are reimbursed on a flat fee basis
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
um and we have seen
 
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
not a significant decrease but it was
 
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.790 align:start position:0%
not a significant decrease but it was
probably

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
150 to 200 fewer cases coming into
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
contract attorneys this fiscal year
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
compared to last year
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget has flat funding
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
for the contract attorney line and we
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
believe that that will be sufficient for
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
defender program 1094.
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
is by far the biggest percentage of our
 
00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
is by far the biggest percentage of our
budget

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
the governor has maintained level
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
funding for the public defender program
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
at 23 751
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
832. for both fiscal years 22
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
and 23. and we believe that that is
 
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.910 align:start position:0%
and 23. and we believe that that is
sufficient

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
for what we anticipate will be the
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
public defender
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
they are the backbone of our indigent
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
defense system handling about 85
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the cases statewide there is
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
um has been a decrease in new cases
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
but that is being offset by the amount
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
of time that cases are remaining open
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you an example on february
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
19th of 2020
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
the public defender had a total of 9522
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
open cases on that same date just a few
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
days ago the same date this year they
 
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.110 align:start position:0%
days ago the same date this year they
had

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
11 967 open cases
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
this has an impact on the staff attorney
 
00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:43.670 align:start position:0%
this has an impact on the staff attorney
caseloads

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
caseloads
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
by contract with the judicial council
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
the public defender is supposed to
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
keep attorneys at or below 70 open
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
inactive cases because so many cases
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
have not resolved
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
they are now facing case loads of over
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
100 cases
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
is this because the courts have
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
basically been closed because of the
 
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
basically been closed because of the
pandemic

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
i believe that it's a combination of
 
00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:10.470 align:start position:0%
i believe that it's a combination of
factors

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
cases are not moving as quickly through
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
the courts because courts were closed
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's also more difficult to get in touch
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
with clients
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
and i think we're seeing an increase in
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
felony cases
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
over misdemeanor cases and felony cases
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
tend to take longer to resolve
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
do you think you're seeing an increase
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
in felony cases because of felony first
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
or cases used to go to the district
 
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
or cases used to go to the district
court

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
before the supreme superior courts
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
i believe that that could be very a
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
role in what we're seeing the public
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
defender has statistics showing the
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of cases that resolved as
 
00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:48.630 align:start position:0%
percentage of cases that resolved as
misdemeanors

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
prior to felonies first in the district
 
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.150 align:start position:0%
prior to felonies first in the district
courts

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
courts
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
and there were some courts that were
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
able to resolve cases very quickly is
 
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.030 align:start position:0%
able to resolve cases very quickly is
misdemeanors

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
i think some of that is the local
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge that folks talk about
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
a prosecutor and a judge who know the
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
families in their community
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
and know who is going to be a repeat
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
offender or who can
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
really resolve a case with a misdemeanor
 
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
really resolve a case with a misdemeanor
resolution

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
and will then get back on track
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
again while we don't expect to see a
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
sharp increase
 
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases like we do with the
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
child protection cases
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
we do expect those numbers to increase
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
and some of the issues that public
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
defender clients tend to struggle with
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
mental health diagnosis substance use
 
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.190 align:start position:0%
mental health diagnosis substance use
issues

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
those are being exacerbated during the
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic as folks are isolated
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
and maybe not able to get to services
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
that they would be using
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
prior to covet um we anticipate
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
an increased need and also an increase
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the number of people who qualify for
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
a public defender
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
non-consulate services are all of the
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
experts transcriptionists translators
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
that the court has approved in a
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
criminal case the judge has made a
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
determination that those are necessary
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
services for a constitutionally adequate
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
representation of defense now those
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
cases have
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
those costs rather have increased quite
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
over the past several years and again
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'll just point you to page three of our
 
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.190 align:start position:0%
i'll just point you to page three of our
handout

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
handout
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
services other than council is the last

item
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
and you can see that we have had a
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
we really have exceeded 1.2 million
 
00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:50.949 align:start position:0%
we really have exceeded 1.2 million
dollars

00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
for the last four fiscal years
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
we are seeing fewer invoices right now
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
again a result of the pandemic but we do
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
have an additional prioritized need
 
00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.430 align:start position:0%
have an additional prioritized need
request

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
for this line it is 483
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
129 for fiscal 22
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
and a little less 467
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
966 for fiscal 23.
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
once the court has made a determination
 
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.870 align:start position:0%
once the court has made a determination
that

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
a service is necessary the judicial
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
council was obligated to pay for that
 
00:14:28.839 --> 00:14:35.269 align:start position:0%
council was obligated to pay for that
service

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%

such as unlawful evictions foreclosures

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%

maintains level funding at 1.5 million
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
due in part to the increase in state

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%

pandemic has certainly underscored the
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
importance of assisting people with
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
these basic needs

response to the pandemic
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
has been nimble and effective they
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
created the crisis response fellowship
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
a public-private partnership that
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
maximized their cares act funding

they have been conducting remote

hearings and client meetings
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
which is obviously not going to be
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate for all clients
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
some people need face-to-face
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
communication or don't have access to
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
sufficient broadband but when that is
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
enough this allows nhla to assign cases
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
based on the need instead of the

eviction processes and have had very
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
good turnout
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
folks from all over the state can tune

not given specific legal advice
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
but they are able to get educated and
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
get some practical information
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%

there are specific questions for them
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
but i believe that they're going to
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
start making those available
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
to folks who weren't able to be at the

unmuted i muted myself i'm sorry um
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
do you handle all types of cases or
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
there are some civil cases that you do
 
00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
there are some civil cases that you do
not

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's right the judicial council so
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
our agency doesn't provide any direct
 
00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
our agency doesn't provide any direct
representation

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
we work with these different programs or
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
pay individual attorneys
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
so the public defender handles the
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
criminal side
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
of things where somebody is facing
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
charges has been arrested
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
then we pay for certain representation
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
in child protection cases which are also

00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
or were you trying to tell us
 
00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
so thank you that's why i took my hand

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
when mike start again that was adequate
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
um sarah can you continue please
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i'm sorry i was talking
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
about our
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation for casa and telling you a
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
bit about the extraordinary work that
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
their advocates are doing
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'll just i'll briefly back up to
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
say again that in fiscal 20 casa
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
spent over 77 000 hours and drove over
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
500 000
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
miles on their cases and if we had had
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
to pay for that through the private
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
guardian ad advice
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
program it would have cost well over 4.5
 
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
program it would have cost well over 4.5
million

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
because of the urgent nature of these
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
cases the courts have prioritized them
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
the number of new cases coming in has
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
decreased between the stuff
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
but the cases that are pending are still
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
moving through
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
everybody is doing what needs to be done
 
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
to keep these on track
 
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
and when it was clear that in-person
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
visits were not possible
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
in all cases casa quickly pivoted
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
to require their advocates to have eyes
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
on their skills
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
or face time but to ensure that somebody
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
was actually seeing these foods
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
during the tendency of the case and
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
during the
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
first half of this fiscal year casas
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
actually had
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
more contact with their children because
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
they understand the
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
dangers of the isolation that we've all
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
been under and they have really gone
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
above and beyond
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
they estimate that now about 46 of cases
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
are happening in person
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
advocates get vaccinated but that number
 
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
is fluid and if there's an outbreak at a
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
certain facility
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
then the visits may have to go back to
 
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.390 align:start position:0%
then the visits may have to go back to
the

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic they're conducting online
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
information sessions where they're able
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
to reach a
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
large variety of a number of folks
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing their training for new
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
advocates remotely
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
and those are some efficiencies that
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
casa intends to bring forward even after
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
a distant memory for all of us
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
the last uh i want to talk about is the
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
non-casa guardians as light on and this
 
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
is another
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
area where we are seeking an additional
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
prioritized need
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
150 000 a year for each year of the
 
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.909 align:start position:0%
150 000 a year for each year of the
biennium

00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget maintains level
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
funding for this accounting unit
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
but as you can see if you take another
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
look again on page three of our handout
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
that these costs have been
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
in excess of three hundred thousand
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
dollars for the past
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
two fiscal years private guardians that
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
light up
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
only take a case if a casa is
 
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.750 align:start position:0%
only take a case if a casa is
unavailable

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
unavailable
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're paid an hourly reimbursement
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
rate of 60
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
and our expenditures are down again for
 
00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:09.510 align:start position:0%
and our expenditures are down again for
this

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
accounting unit right now but we do
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
expect that we will need the additional
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
funding to meet the need going forward
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have any other comments right
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
now but i'm
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions from the
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee and i certainly appreciate
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
everyone's time
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
and patience with i guess i just have
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
bad technology luck wherever i go so
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
we always appreciate you coming and bad
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
technology luck is it really a thing it
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
just sometimes happens in this room
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
or in any other room anybody have a
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry hold on while we pass the
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
mic back and forth
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but i had to go
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
several times and the lines that we had
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
to go back
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
for were services other than council and
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
the private guardians of items
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
and also the probate guardian as light
 
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.350 align:start position:0%
and also the probate guardian as light
online

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
you can see our our actual
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures in those areas
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
have been exceeded what we were
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
originally appropriated i now think that
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
given the decrease in the assigned
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
council costs
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
that that is a line that we will likely
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
not need to go back for
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
sarah and your adjusted authors for 2021
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
does that include all the money
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
hi representative over it's mike again i
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
think we lost sarah again
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
oh i just how's that
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
um in and out we'll let mike really
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
close to you and don't look down
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
anything hold the
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
paper up there you go thank you
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
the budget that you're looking at the
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 20 does include what we
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
received when we went back
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
for additional funding okay all right
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
so representation sorry you had a second
 
00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.509 align:start position:0%
so representation sorry you had a second
question

00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
and i was due for an increase this past
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.909 align:start position:0%
and i was due for an increase this past
summer

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
summer
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
but i did not take them because of the
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions by anyone on the
 
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.269 align:start position:0%
additional questions by anyone on the
committee

00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um we're still sarah's mike
 
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.269 align:start position:0%
thank you um we're still sarah's mike
and

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
and peter's mike was cutting in and out
 
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
so i just want to clarify a couple
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
things because i wasn't hearing at all
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to get the number
 
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.070 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to get the number
that

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
um would include her additional requests
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
do we have that number or does the is
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
the number in our binder include that
 
00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
the number in our binder include that
number

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
or how do we know how much to fund her
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
that would include the additional
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
request she has listed on paid three
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
she brought page three with her when she
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
came today
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
yeah she did take it down to janet so it
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
could be distributed
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
the additional total amount represent
 
00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.870 align:start position:0%
the additional total amount represent
walls

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
walls
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2022 and that includes
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
four lines it would be 880 000.
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
23 goes up to 865
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
plus dollars so i added those together
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i get 1.746478
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
and my question is do we need to take
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
that 1.7
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
million and add it to the amount and our
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
binder to get an
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
this is i would say given what she's
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
said to us sarah if i miss phrase what i
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
think you said
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
speak right up and tell me why i'm wrong
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
but she's
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
said she's given it her best estimate
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
knowing the courts have not been meeting
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
knowing some of the cases have been off
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
plus the fact
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
that director ribson over at hhs has
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
started a new program
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
that hopefully will include her with
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
some funding
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
i close to understanding what you said
 
00:33:39.519 --> 00:33:41.029 align:start position:0%
i close to understanding what you said
overall

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct and so the the three
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
accounting units that i
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing additional
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation for
 
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
are the services other than council
 
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.190 align:start position:0%
are the services other than council
[Music]

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
the non-casa guardians of leiden
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
and our gal fund which is really probate
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
and termination of parental rights costs
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
represent walls additional questions or
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
further clarification
 
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
now i'm just trying to get a handle on
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount for this
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
and that's all and i just so if we're
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to approve this i just wanted to
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
have some idea what it is
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
that we need to be adding in in addition
 
00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
that we need to be adding in in addition
to

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
what's in the binder i don't think given
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
director bridget's number will be
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
approving or not approving this today we
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
should get revenue estimates for house
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
ways and means
 
00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
on the 25th and anything that needs to
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
have changes
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
or potentially have changes anything
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
that uses general fund dollars
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to go forward
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
with today
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much well even when
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
we go forward i still want
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
would like to have a solid number as to
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
i mean is the 1.746 million the correct
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
number or is it a different number
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's her best estimate today at the time
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
where she is with the request she has
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct and i
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have the total for
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
those two years
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the total of
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
is on page three of our handout for
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's 880 thousand eight into thirty four
 
00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:26.790 align:start position:0%
it's 880 thousand eight into thirty four
dollars

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
and it is a bit less in the next year at
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
eight hundred sixty five thousand six
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
hundred forty four dollars thank you
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
those are the numbers i used i just
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
added them together
