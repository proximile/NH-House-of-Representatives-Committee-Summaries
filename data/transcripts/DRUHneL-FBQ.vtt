uh so I will not be scheduling anything
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
for next week uh historically I I um I
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
don't take I don't like to do Senate
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
bills until after crossover that way I
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
know all the bills that we have and of
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
course I would then organiz oriz them by
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
type so that they our hearings are
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
organized and in this case I have to you
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
know consult with the senator to make
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
sure the senator is able to come over
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
and be here when that we'll be
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
introducing those
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
bills um last night I was going through
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
the bills and realized that the sheet
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
that we normally would use the
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
scheduling sheet um I got down to the
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
bottom and I said I feel like I'm
 
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
missing something um and so so I ended
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
up um well now that now all a sudden
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
most of them are
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
here so we'll work from this
 
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
sheet assuming that what's in front of
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
everybody so that's one one that says
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
revised at the top so maybe I didn't
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
have the right revisal when I did it I
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened
 
00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:23.710 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened
so

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
okay so first bill House Bill
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%

size of lumber width and depth is
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
something that they base their entire
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
sales worldwide and so it's not it's not
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
something that can be
 
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:20.600 align:start position:0%

those opposed so move
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
damous okay now 1320 we do we have the
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
1320 Mr chair point of order um on the
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
last bill does the FN require it to be
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
on the regular calendar no FN means that
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
the uh fiscal note was issued okay okay
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
and in this case the fiscal Noe was said
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
nothing okay didn't say anything so the
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
only time that you you theoretically
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
need to have it on the regular calendar
 
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
is if there is an actual
 
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.269 align:start position:0%
is if there is an actual
appropriation

00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
ironically the vast majority of bills
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
that we get even if they did have an
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's not in the bill but
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
it has to go to finance and then they
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
make the appropriation so ironically
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
even though that may be true that the
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation is appropriate that it it
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
it usually we we never actually see it
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
so but in this case uh this case there
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
was no appropriation for the bill so
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
so it's in the
 
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.310 align:start position:0%
so it's in the
folder

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
uhhuh so theoretically I like I I was
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
thinking about this last night that I
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to have the subcommittee in
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
other words the subcommittee could be
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
waved off um and it was just that so I'm
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
going to I'm going assuming that I want
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
to get past this amendment around now
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
and assuming that nobody has a problem
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
with it and everybody's ready to vote
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
for it then we don't need to have the
 
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.470 align:start position:0%
for it then we don't need to have the
subcommittee

00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
like you know that I think that's that's
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
a that's a hearing that's not even a
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee subcommittees are a little
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
Loosey gooy but that's true I could do
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
that anyways okay so you're saying I
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
have it here yeah 1320 you see it right
 
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm passing around and so
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
everybody has a chance to look at the
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
amendment anyways because you're going
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
to have to see it now and assuming if if
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
there nobody has a problem then we can
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
just go ahead and exec it if there is a
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
problem then we will uh not take it up
 
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
and wait until U the subcommittee meets
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:07.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
you can vote no if you want to vote if
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
you want to vote no that's fine it won't
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.389 align:start position:0%
 
feelings

00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
00:28:17.399 --> 00:28:19.549 align:start position:0%
feelings
two

00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
five

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:33.509 align:start position:0%
five
eight

00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
great yep that looks pretty good looks
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
job Mr chairman yes it looks like it's
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said we were going to
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
actually I did see something
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
new and it's on line
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
five and that is just because uh they
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
are a model efficiency that they did say
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
by the way we're we're
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
adding flood and the only other thing as
 
00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
I said is after we heard uh yesterday is
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%

numeral uh if they're like you know if
 
00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:40.519 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know where where they'll
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
end up putting P but if there is a
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%

about the one where the guy it was the
 
00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:04.470 align:start position:0%
about the one where the guy it was the
pricing

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
well let me put it this
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
officially at an exec session someone
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
can as to bring up an amendment yes okay
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
um but as a control freak chairman um
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
you know that I would order that any
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that shows up then I would say
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
no we won't take action we would then
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
send it back to subcommittee and have
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work it out so that by
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
the time so that that that can be
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
resolved so um if somebody were to show
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
up with a with an amendment in while
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're executing um you know normally
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
other committees do thrash it out
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
committees as a whole and you know and I
 
00:35:44.349 --> 00:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
woe the day that I
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
happens under my guidance that I would I
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
would prefer to send it to subcommittee
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
and have it you know worked out thrashed
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
out because I just think it's more
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
productive when you have a small group
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
of people who are focused I just want
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
understand your process thank you for
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
explain to clarify yes um I just want to
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
understand it so are you saying because
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
they emailed it we're not taking it up
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
no we did subcommittee actually was
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
aware of the amendment yeah when the
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the sub committee made
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
the decision not to not to address it
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
because he he he the the feeling of the
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee was it wasn't really
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
resolving okay the problem okay great
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
thanks um an amendment can be brought to
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
the floor and Amendment could always
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
even on session date y right and you
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
could say it's because that mean nasty
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
but but like I said that my process that
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
is that I I when we get to exec session
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
I that we've already thrashed it out
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to take everybody's
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
time up on on something that that is an
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
issue that really if and and this one in
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
particular this particular Bill really
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
does need some serious hard thinking
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
about how we're going to address this
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
problem and do it right so
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative run who welcome to the
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
Congress committee thank you thank you
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
um so is the motion in terms study stud
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you so we're going to work
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
on it we're we we we're definitely not
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
we're not ignoring it it's just that
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's something that's going to take some
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
time and really think it through and how
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
we can do it do it right I really
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee doing that
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
because if you remember from the public
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
hearing the assistant the senior
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General supported
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill with two very minor changes
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
and you know this industry is one of the
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
top three I think said that they
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
received complaints upon and even though
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
they are those complaints are centered
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
around one company that company H has or
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
had the largest market share and there's
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that specifies that
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
company so I think it does provide
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
protection for the little guys that send
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
us here you know the the the little
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
grandmas that aren't going to fight a
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
big company they're just going to pay
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
the extra fee or wait to change
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
suppliers so I I think it's a very
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
important bill um I was really you know
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
hoping to go Gang Busters to try to get
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment but I'm very I I I'm
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the interm study and I
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
think we could work closely with the
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
with attorney uh Garrett and the
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
consumer protection um Bureau to to Hash
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%

the blur on this one okay all right
 
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative spear second by
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
representative hunt um 1491 prohibiting
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
the repricing of heating fuel subsequent
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
to a concluded
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
you yes you were just on account of I
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
just have to do due diligence on stuff
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
we did get two amendments on this and so
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
I called a couple of fuel suppliers this
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
is the one I called a couple of fuel
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
suppliers as the case was presented to
 
00:41:50.589 --> 00:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
us in the the cases where I called the
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
fuel suppliers they said they would not
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
deliver fuel to a house that they had
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
not inspected and established a cont
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
contract even if it's a pay as you go
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
corre so they had to have a contract and
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
in that contract it would have said when
 
00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
you use a credit
 
00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
card you're reserving the right to get
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
the fuel but you're not committed to the
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
price you still have to pay the price on
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
the day that they pick it up I guess in
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
Boston I guess is where they pick this
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
the the fuel oil up so the case that was
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
described to us is not a case anybody
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
seems to recognize as being something
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
that should be handled any different
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
than they handle any other case so I
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
think the itl is the right motion right
 
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
and and if they really wanted to be
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
locking in the price they can do a pre-
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
buby then they could do the pre- buby
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what they I was told by these
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
these suppliers right and if in the
 
00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
worst comes worst case for the state if
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
you're not happy with the arrangement
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
with your propane dealer there's plenty
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
of other propane dealers available that
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
you can do business with except if you
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
have your tank buried then it's another
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
story then have to be like me and own my
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
own tank right pay the two grand and own
 
00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:05.559 align:start position:0%
your own tank okay motions in expedient

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%

explain

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh um well the one thing I know because
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
we've had this issue for many years
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
talking about how we're going to U help
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
condos with proxy voting the key element
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing here is that the actual
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
proxy ballot will be very much like let
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
say the ballot you get when you vote on
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
proxies for your for stock companies it
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
is specific to the actual motion so the
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
ones we've always saw before was that
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
another condo owner would hold the proxy
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
for somebody else and that always seemed
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
problematic that and so that this way
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
that the actual voting issue is in hand
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
at ahead of time everybody knows it
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what you know in terms
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
of what they're voting yes or no on and
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
um and so that seems to resolve the
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
issue once or for all it's not a blanket
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a blanket proxy
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
exactly okay any discussion on the
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%

00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
so uh just just to remind everybody that
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
even what this bill does is that it says
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
be we we already have the statute you
 
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:14.039 align:start position:0%
know in law that mography are are you
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
get a free MOG women get can have a free
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
mogy every every year and that was an
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
issue at one point time because it used
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
to be like a year and a day and so that
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
was problematic but we solved it and to
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
annual annually um and what this says is
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
that if there is a need for the uh
 
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
secondary diagnostic survey then then
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
that too will also be
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
free that's great
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
so nothing for real it said but but
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
going forward that the year next year if
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
it turns out negative you're going going
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
forward you don't you don't get to keep
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
that it's the same it's the same for you
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
still got to get the regular mography
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
right you have to you have to have the
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
five

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
for

01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
pusc seconded by representative
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
burough moves ought to pass on the
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
0998 um so basically this this is sort
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
of a housekeeping measure but we it of
 
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
of things that had come to my attention
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
over the uh the year and people say well
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
we need to do this we need that we got
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
to fix this problem fix that problem um
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
the problems uh occurred um a was the
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
um these Hookah Hookah
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
establishments um were operating under a
 
01:06:53.549 --> 01:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
cigar bar statue and but they they
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
weren't necessarily smoking cigar
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
they were're doing hookas so we're just
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying that uh that they that a
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
cigar bar can include a hookah
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
um the distill yeah it's licensed to
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
distill um in terms of uh the quantities
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
and then we have a scaled up pricing uh
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
for their
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
licensing and
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
hookah okay so
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
her so what we're doing is we're just
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
creating um a two different uh a tier
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
system when it comes to distilling so in
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
terms of license so this was designed to
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh reduce the am I got this right Dan no
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
maybe uh yeah that first section six of
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
the bill oh I'm thinking of there's
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
other sections because this is six yeah
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
so what was six
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
for just introduce yourself so everybody
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
REM deputy chief Danielle Elon New
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor enforcement um no this
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
just clarifies that it's if you're
 
01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
licensed to distill then this paragraph
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
applies to you because there's also the
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
home distilling bill in so we wanted to
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
make sure there was clarification
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
between the liquor manufacturers that
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
are licensed to distill versus what's
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
happening in the home distilling bill so
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
um it just changes it used to say each
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer distilling and now
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
it just says license to distill so we
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
didn't change quantities or anything
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
like that we just clarify just clar the
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
licensed liquor Manu like I said this is
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
housekeeping correct related to the bill
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
that we passed already that we allowed
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
to home home license home
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
so so this is not related to hookah no
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
that is not a hookah section section
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
seven of the bill is the hookah which
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
was the original underlying kind of got
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
mixed up with because this came in
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
because the original bill you can see
 
01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
we're at six section six so there was
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
one through five right with other
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
various issues and then this one just
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
came over the transom in the end and you
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
know we whether we could we could slip
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
it in while we were still working on
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
bills last last fall and and the U ol
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%

this

01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
secret but I would say
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
yeah they had more fancier fers so you
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
knew you knew there was a the Chairman's
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
compe oh you knew it was sacred oh and
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
we don't get to see those even but chair
 
01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
even see the chairman holders
 
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.310 align:start position:0%
even see the chairman holders
anymore

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay so Dan you want don't you just tell
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
we're good morning Deputy Chief Danielle
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
Alston New Hampshire L enforcement just
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
mic so um this amendment deals with
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
contract um manufactur ining and tenant
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the most basic explanation
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
of this is I have a recipe it needs
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
certain equipment to produce that recipe
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
you own that equipment so we enter to a
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
contract together where you are now
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to produce my recipe um in the
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
past this concept has traditionally uh
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
been for beverage manufacturers this
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and and what started was
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
this some guy from Maine who wanted to
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
bring it to New Hampshire and that was
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
add a new twist he had the recipe uh uh
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in New Hampshire had the
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
equipment so he wants them to produce
 
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
his product in New Hampshire so that's
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
what's start and then and then we had we
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
had originally had tenant manufacturing
 
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
and contract were separate now we're
 
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
trying to pull them all into one statute
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
and correct so one stop shopping for
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
shake and
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
bake the repl the
 
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.669 align:start position:0%
bake the repl the
entire

01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh it does it
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
does is this the buck restaurant or the
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
U the
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%

01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%

01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%

thank you for filling
 
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:06.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for filling
in

01:20:06.590 --> 01:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
again and I guess
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay so Senate bills um right now
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
there are trickling in um and um my my
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
expectation is not to uh start doing
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
hearings I know other committees are are
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
already hot to trot but I'm I'm my at
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
attitude is to wait until to see what we
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
have and then try to schedule them as a
 
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
group so that that you know makes it
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
easy for us to um uh have the public
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and the groupings will somewhat
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
be so much as we a is you know we try to
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
do it by our categories but um our
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
divisions but a lot is actually driven
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
by the the Senate sponsor so if if a
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
senate sponsor has several different
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
bills and different subjects it's going
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
to be more the hearing will be about
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
that that day for the senator uh and
 
01:21:00.629 --> 01:21:00.639 align:start position:0%
that I have to schedule so it makes it
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's a little different twist in
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
scheduling bills when I have to have to
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
work with the senator um but otherwise
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I I we've always wait till
 
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
till April before we we start those so
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
you have a couple of days off for next
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
week next two weeks I guess except there
 
01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:18.709 align:start position:0%
week next two weeks I guess except there
might

01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
be session
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
days multiple session days so other
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
