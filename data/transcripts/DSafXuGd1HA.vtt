jurisdictions
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative baum you're going to open
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
the bill for us
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and honorable
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
members of municipal and county
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm ralph baume hillsborough district
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
20 town of litchfield
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
i believe passed out testimony to
 
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.870 align:start position:0%
i believe passed out testimony to
everybody

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.910 align:start position:0%
everybody
and

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
the reason for the municipal
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
official ballot law was that town did
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
not have a facility big enough to hold
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
regular town or school district meetings
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
one downtown i know of had meetings in
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
multiple locations with tv hookup
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
between locations even that was not
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
enough so this law came into being
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
allowing everyone the opportunity to
 
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
allowing everyone the opportunity to
vote

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
this bill is common sense if the
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
governing body reduces something in
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
their proposed operating budget in other
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
words the selectmen or school board they
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
must make the same reductions in the
 
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
must make the same reductions in the
default

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
when this law was first passed in 1995
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
the default budgets were always lower
 
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
than the proposed operating budget but
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
after a while certain associations and
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers figure out a way by using the
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
wording of the law to manipulate the
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
default budget to make it higher than
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
the operating budget to ensure that the
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
budget will pass
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
but that was not the intent of the law
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you read the section 4013
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
roman 11 dash c
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
the wording of the second ballot
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
the second session valid question
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
concerning operating budget shall be as
 
00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
concerning operating budget shall be as
follows

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
follows
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
and if you read it and should this
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
article be defeated the default budget
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
shall be which is the same but then it
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
says or the governing body may hold one
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
special meeting in accordance with 4013
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
10 and 16 to take up the issue of
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
revived operating budget only so you can
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
see the intent was
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
the default would be lower if the
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
default was higher then why would
 
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.750 align:start position:0%
default was higher then why would
anybody

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
then why would this be in the law if the
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
article was defeated what governing body
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
would ask for a special meaning if they
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
got more
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
money what school districts are what
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
school districts are doing to follow the
 
00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
law is for example not needing three
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
teachers they are removed from the
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget but left in
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
the default if the teacher's contract
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
says they will fund clubs and sports
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
stipends for a total of 20k but never
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
spent more than 15 you guessed that the
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
operating budget will be 15 but the
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
default will be 20. on the town side if
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
every other year the town buys two
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
police cruisers but then won the next
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
year the year with the one we'll have
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
two in the default etc etc
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
for example this year my school district
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the proposed operating budget is 23
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
million 766 000 while the default is 24
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
million 184 thousand
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
how do you think the people will vote
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
also the vote
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
luckily this i can say luckily but we
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
had the snowstorm friday so this was
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
moved we had a deliberative session last
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
moved we had a deliberative session last
saturday

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
and sure enough
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
the t the school board
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
did not recommend
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
this budget
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
5-0 against it of course they wanted to
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
fail so they get more money with the
 
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
default which was not the intent of the
 
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
default which was not the intent of the
law

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
also i
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
i was just looking at to propose bill
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
and for example
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
the rsa 197 thing was crossed out that
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
should not have been i don't know how i
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
missed that but anyway
 
00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.470 align:start position:0%
missed that but anyway
um

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
but i'll
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
available for any questions
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%

um this particular rsa we've been
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
talking about for several years in a row
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
giving little nudges here and there
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
i was um
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
explain to me how line nine which is the
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
new language that you're putting in
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
uh works with line 18 the definition of
 
00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:09.749 align:start position:0%
uh works with line 18 the definition of
contracts

00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
which means the contracts previously
 
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.350 align:start position:0%
which means the contracts previously
approved

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
so you might have a contract in your
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
that stops
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
in your proposed budget but in here the
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
contract it means
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the default is what was previously
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
approved so you're still going to have
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
that empty bucket bucket of money aren't
 
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
that empty bucket bucket of money aren't
you

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
no because
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
i was always my argument when i was on
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
the school board because the default
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
they said well the contract says i said
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
then aren't we breaking the law with the
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
proposed operating budget
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
so the argument being
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh well number of teachers that's
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
usually not in the contract but
 
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.629 align:start position:0%
usually not in the contract but
but

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
stipends are but the stipends in the
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
contract say we've got to pay this much
 
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
contract say we've got to pay this much
if

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know but they always put the amount
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
total amount so
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
the number of teachers for example is
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
not in the contract and and i don't
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
think that's an issue if if you're
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the school board or or
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
selectmen and you're voting to delete
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
something or reduce something
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
that may be in a contract then aren't
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
you breaking the law not according to
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
those no but that's what i mean it's my
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
thing is that to me this is common sense
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
if i'm reducing something i was a
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
selectmen also on the school board and
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
also on the budget committee for 22
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
years not at the same time but i know
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
how how these things are done and
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
they've done
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
because i remember when i was on the
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
school board i did not approve the
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
budget because the default was always
 
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.350 align:start position:0%
budget because the default was always
wrong

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
and and i but
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
well that's what the law says but yeah
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're manipulating the law that was not
 
00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
the intent of the law the intent was the
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
default should always be lower or why
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
would you have that in law okay thank
 
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.230 align:start position:0%
would you have that in law okay thank
you

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes purpose
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
does this then assume that the default
 
00:18:05.919 --> 00:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
does this then assume that the default
budget

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
would would ebb and flow as the
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
operating budget then ebbs and flows by
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
any changes made by the budget committee
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
official budget committee or the
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
no the problem is the default
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
unless there's one section that nobody
 
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
passes that the default budget is has to
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
be done by the governing body period so
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah if
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's another issue if if the budget
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
could still end up being
 
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.230 align:start position:0%
could still end up being
higher

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
reduces money or on the floor delivered
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
a session to reduce money but the point
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
is this would just
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
let's make it fairer in other words if
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm if the governing body is reducing
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
something let's make it transparent that
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
the default has also got that same
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
reduction there is also possibilities
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
but the point is let's have the school
 
00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:07.039 align:start position:0%
board or governing body sell the budget
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
not just make it automatic
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
that people are going to vote yes
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
because it's lower
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the towns right so
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
how would this impact the cities no okay
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
no just for towns that have
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
voted for the municipality law which is
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
what we used to be called everybody's
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
still calling an sb2 because that was
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 2 in 1995.
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you just clarifying
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appreciate it
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
and that closes the hearing on hb 1070.
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.029 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have uh
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay miss heck
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
please uh
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman dolan and members
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
of committee my name is catherine heck
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
 
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.230 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire municipal
association

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
and our position is that we have to
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill on the technicalities
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
that it proposes within the law
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
i understand that in 2018 house bill
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
1370 and senate bill 342 made some
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
significant clarifications to how a
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
default budget should be calculated so
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
that it was conservatively done and
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
many factors would be considered
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
we do have a handout that i will leave
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
for you that nhma has produced for our
 
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
members to explain what those changes
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
are so there are not um
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
mistakes in those default calculations
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the sb2 towns but when speaking um
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill as it reads and line
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
9 less any reduction to appropriation
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
the governing body made in the proposed
 
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.950 align:start position:0%
the governing body made in the proposed
budget

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
the default budget is based on a
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
previous year's proposed
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
approved budget rather the proposed
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
approved amount not what the actual
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
expenditures were
 
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.149 align:start position:0%
expenditures were
so

00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
in this case it kind of creates a circle
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
of redundancy in that if you're sitting
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
at your deliberative session and the
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
legislative body chooses to reduce an
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
amount or the governing body has made a
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
reduction that they're bringing forth
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
the default budget cannot accept that in
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
its calculation using the ms-737 for a
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
budget committee or the ms-636 because
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative body has not yet
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
approved that amount so for cutting
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
teachers a governing body or a budget
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
committee might say and of course i i
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't that's a terrible example but
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
he did bring up cuttings cutting
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
positions i should say if that's the
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
case the legislative body has not
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
approved those cuts so they could in
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
fact say we would like to maintain those
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
positions whether it's our highway
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
people or any other salaried position
 
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
people or any other salaried position
so

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
i do understand the intent is to clarify
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
what the law is however default budgets
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
due to things like one-time expenditures
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
or warrant articles can in fact end up
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
higher than the prior years
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
in the next year's proposed budget
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
because maybe you did a large project
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
that you don't anticipate doing again
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
your default budget from last year would
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
in fact be higher because the voters
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
approved that one-time project so we do
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
have some concerns with this language as
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
the legislative body has not been
 
00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.669 align:start position:0%
the legislative body has not been
considered

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
how it would affect the intent of what
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is trying to do
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
so i can certainly take any questions
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes could you
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of edification of the
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee explain
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
the difference between the legislative
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
body and the governing body
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
of course so the legislative body are
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
the voters the registered voters who
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
come to the deliberative session in an
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
sb2 town to cast their votes and approve
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
what the governing body has proposed the
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
governing body and budgeting in this
 
00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
case could be
 
00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
the school board the select board or an
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
official budget committee of a school
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
district or a town so
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we would
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
also point out that again that ms 737 or
 
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.190 align:start position:0%
also point out that again that ms 737 or
636

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
636
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
is what the default is supposed to be
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
based off of so any new
 
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
based off of so any new
additions

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
additions
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
certainly should not be in the default
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
budget because the voters have not
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
approved them
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
but i can understand the conundrum that
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
we discussed just in this room a few
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
days ago of the default budget ending up
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
somehow higher than the proposed budget
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i again i will leave the handout
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
that explains exactly how we interpret
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
the law and the recommendations we make
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
to our members to ensure that the
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
default budget is properly calculated
 
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.470 align:start position:0%
default budget is properly calculated
representative

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you miss
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
hex for taking my question you kind of
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat clarified
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
my question in my mind you know the
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
base budget
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
is the approved budget from the previous
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
year and that becomes the base budget
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
that you're working off of so it's not
 
00:24:59.039 --> 00:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
that you're working off of so it's not
the

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
operating budget because at the end of
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
the year what the budget was is not what
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
the operating budget could be slightly
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
different correct
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay my one more follow-up yes go ahead
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um my other
 
00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:20.799 align:start position:0%
question is again
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
how many towns
 
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
will be affected if this becomes a law
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
i do not know off the top of my head how
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
many sb2 towns
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
that we have i don't know if my
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
colleague do you know do you know how
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
would you agree
that

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
the intent of the law
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be if at deliberative session
 
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.830 align:start position:0%
would be if at deliberative session
the

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.710 align:start position:0%
the
voters

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
voters
disapproved

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
disapproved
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
the operating budget because
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
they felt it was too high
 
00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:21.990 align:start position:0%
they felt it was too high
okay

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
default budget
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
is higher
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
than the proposed budget when it comes
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
to voting
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
would you agree that that shouldn't
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
happen very often
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
and if it happens repeatedly
 
00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
year after year after year
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that there is a problem with the law
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
i think that's a complex question
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
because when we're looking at our
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
default budget we're also considering
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
anything else that the voters have
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
approved on the warrant including
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
warrant articles so
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
which is fully in the legislative body's
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
control to approve or not approve so if
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
they're approving large projects
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
one-time projects year-over-year say
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
paving a giant parking lot or doing over
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
a townhouse
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
if they're approving that and that is
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
their will of the people and the voter
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
to do that it would be very complicated
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
the default budget would not end up
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
higher what i think
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
the intent is
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
when the governing body has that occur
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
and they have a lower budget my hope is
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
that it's not to have any type of
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
deception it's because they are saying
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do that one time
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
project again and therefore the budget
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
is lower i'm i'm hoping that um
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
and knowing the communities that we work
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
with they're just doing the calculation
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
based on based on the law and what the
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
voters have put forth and approved in
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
the previous year sir so
 
00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
the previous year sir so
i

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the intent and i
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
think when the governing body is or the
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
budget committee is bringing forward an
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
operating budget or and a warrant that's
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
lower than the default it's because they
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
took great care in deciding
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
in this current year what the one-time
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
projects or additional needs of that
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
community are so i think it's a very
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
complicated question and if there's
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
individual communities
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
that are experiencing this
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
i think that they should look at what
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
they've been approving as a legislative
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
body actually
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
would you would you agree that
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
before sb2
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
everybody came to the town meeting
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
or the school board or the school
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
district meeting
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
and the budget there was no default
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
budget the budget was decided at that
 
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.909 align:start position:0%
budget the budget was decided at that
meeting

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
then we came along with sb2
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
which gives everyone in town registered
 
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.909 align:start position:0%
which gives everyone in town registered
voters

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to vote on the proposed
 
00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:15.590 align:start position:0%
the ability to vote on the proposed
budget

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
the default budget was inserted in there
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
as a fallback position
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
if the proposed operating budget failed
 
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.950 align:start position:0%
if the proposed operating budget failed
okay

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.909 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
i contend
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
that the default budget if it is higher
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
than the proposed operating budget
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
that that's a problem
 
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.190 align:start position:0%
that that's a problem
because

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
because
the

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
school board if they're able to do that
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
then they could care less about the
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
because the default budget's going to be
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
higher anyway
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
so i think that the way
 
00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
manipulating the numbers
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
is a real problem and i think that this
 
00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
is a real problem and i think that this
bill

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:11.110 align:start position:0%
bill
supports

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me on that
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
i have no opinion on that sir
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
miss heck
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
that if a community
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
was putting
 
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.190 align:start position:0%
was putting
one-time

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.950 align:start position:0%
one-time
expenditures

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
into an operating budget that's probably
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
not the proper way to budget
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
every community has its own culture and
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
climate so you can put one-time
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
expenditures into your operating budget
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
you can have separate warrant articles
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
certainly collective bargaining
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
agreements contract and multi-year
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
contract also factor into this default
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
so if you have a multi-year collective
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement the first year it's
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
a warrant article then it rolls in again
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
into your budget um
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately that again would cause
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
the default to be higher but the
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
legislative body approved that say three
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
year five year contract whatever the
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
case may be so i agree that it's very
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
complicated the town meeting allows for
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
the deliberation of the
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
operating budget and all the warrants
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
until the town is satisfied so no one
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
leaves or they have to reconvene until
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
the town is satisfied sb2 doesn't have
 
00:31:36.789 --> 00:31:36.799 align:start position:0%
that same ability they have the
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
deliberative session so of course the
 
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.310 align:start position:0%
deliberative session so of course the
default

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
was a mechanism to your points are
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
created because they don't have that
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
same ability to just debate
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
until they're done and they can come to
 
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
until they're done and they can come to
consensus

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
to answer a question previously ask sir
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
if i may 72 towns are sb2 towns as of
 
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
if i may 72 towns are sb2 towns as of
1231

00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
1231
 
00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:01.110 align:start position:0%
1231
2020.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you how do you characterize
 
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.389 align:start position:0%
thank you how do you characterize
charter

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
charter
 
00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:05.909 align:start position:0%
charter
communities

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
sb2 are not sp2
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
as far as cities are concerned no
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
when you look at those numbers you just
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
quoted does that include charter
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
communities as well that's the list from
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
the dra so
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
i don't have that in front of me
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:24.159 --> 00:32:26.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you miss
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
so i just want to understand something
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
in in an sb2 town
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
the voters come to the deliberative
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
session and when they get to the budget
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
let's say the default budget is higher
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
are the voters able at that session to
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
move that the opera the proposed
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:33:03.919 --> 00:33:04.710 align:start position:0%
operating budget
be

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
cut to even lower what
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
the operating budget was the year before
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
do they have that chance to
 
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.590 align:start position:0%
do they have that chance to
essentially

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.789 align:start position:0%
essentially
um

00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
do what representative baum
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know is suggesting at that
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
deliberative session so they could
 
00:33:21.909 --> 00:33:21.919 align:start position:0%
i'm saying they could cut the budget
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
lower than it was the year before or
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
anything and then
 
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:27.669 align:start position:0%
anything and then
on

00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
is it is it true that then on election
 
00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:30.389 align:start position:0%
is it is it true that then on election
day

00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
whatever changes they made at the
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
deliberative session will then appear on
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
the warrant with the default budget
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
that is correct they have the same
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity at the deliberative session
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
that the town meeting allows they can
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
adjust any line or any warrant article
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
as they see fit as the legislative body
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
so they have that opportunity a
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
deliberative session okay
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
they just don't vote
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and the deliberative session votes to
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
bring that budget forward for a final
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
vote to the large an official vote of
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
the larger community
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
in a usually in about a month okay
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
and then so
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
assume that the deliberative body
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
cuts the budget so it's even lower than
 
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:11.109 align:start position:0%
cuts the budget so it's even lower than
the

00:34:11.109 --> 00:34:11.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
preceding budget i mean okay it's maybe
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
they cut it 20 percent
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
and that gets approved on election day
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
does that then become the basis for the
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
default budget for the following year
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representatives davis
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question i shouldn't even be
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
asking a question because i don't live
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
in an sb town i live in a city
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
but if if the
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
supposition of this bill
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
is that it will
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
avoid people
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh quote-unquote manipulating the
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
numbers upward
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
isn't it also true that people could
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
so they already have the ability to
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
to change the budget to representative
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
rungs point um at the deliberative
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
session but again the default is based
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
on an approved budget from a prior year
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
so the language in the bill is taking
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
that power away from the legislative
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
body's binding vote from the prior year
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
and that is the concern and how we can't
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
seem to reconcile that when i try to do
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
this in practice because i end up kind
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
of in a circular pattern with the
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
proposed language
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
if if the deliberative session does make
 
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.069 align:start position:0%
if if the deliberative session does make
that

00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
or the governing body
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
proposes that change i can't undo a vote
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
of the previous legislative body so
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's kind of an unreconciliation
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
between the governing body or budget
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee as the case may be and the
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
legislative body and the language that
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
this is an abstract somewhat abstract
 
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
topic for those who are not familiar
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
my school district is an sb2 town but i
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify the the process
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
in my understanding so in lines a page
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
one lines fifteen through sixteen
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
it says that in calculating the default
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
budget amount the governing body shall
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow the statutory formula which may
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
result in a higher or lower amount than
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
the proposed operating operating budget
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
so going into the sb2 deliberative
 
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.910 align:start position:0%
so going into the sb2 deliberative
session

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
the default budget is determined as is
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
the the operating budget both are known
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
so um to go back to your testimony
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
you stated that the governing body be it
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
the school board if there's no official
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever or the budget
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee brings forth that operating
 
00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.670 align:start position:0%
committee brings forth that operating
budget

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
they vote on it is that correct
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
they they vote on it before they bring
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
it to the deliberative session the
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
deliberative session is a vote of the is
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
for the legislative body so that's the
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
budget they are bringing forward for the
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
legislative body to deliberate and
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
decide if they would like to move it up
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
or down or change any line they could
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
zero out a warrant article
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
they just can't propose any new business
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
because it has to meet the stay-at-home
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
test that's why petition-worn articles
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
for example have to be submitted in
 
00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:34.870 align:start position:0%
for example have to be submitted in
advance

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
advance
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
so the governing body does not vote at
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
that meeting at that point we have
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
turned over the budget as a governing
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
body to the people and let them decide
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
um and then whatever the decision is
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
made at that meeting is what moves
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
forward for the the official vote
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes go ahead thank you thank
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
so that that yes that confirms my
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
understanding and perhaps i misspoke
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
the governing body whoever owns the
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
budget they they make a recommendation i
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
misspoke if i said vote they vote to
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
so if i um also understand your
 
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
so if i um also understand your
testimony

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
um you pointed out a technicality in the
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
way that this language in in the bill
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
was written
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
in that the if if the
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
at the deliberative session
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
if the uh default budget is amended
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
that poses a problem because the
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.829 align:start position:0%
governing body
then

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
has not provided a recommendation with
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
regard to that amended default budget so
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:49.990 align:start position:0%
my question is
could

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
this language be changed so that
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
before that
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
default budget goes on the warrant could
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
the governing body
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
take a vote to approve or
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
disapprove of that operating budget so
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
the default budget is not deliberated
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
that again is a calculation based on the
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
prior year's legislative body's approval
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
there is no ability to change the
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
default calculation because that
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
calculation has to be disclosed properly
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
noticed to the public it has to be
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
produced and it's based on
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the documents that are provided to the
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration so
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
again it is supposed to be calculated
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
based on the law so there is no
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the default to be
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
questioned because it's already been
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
approved in the prior year's budget i
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative mitchell
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you ms heck
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and this maybe
 
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
should have addressed to the to the
 
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.109 align:start position:0%
should have addressed to the to the
sponsor

00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
um is it i said on the select board of
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
my town is it possible that when my
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
proposed budget came in or the proposed
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
budget came in with an eight percent
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
increase that i could have just
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
rubber stamped that
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
to then create
 
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.630 align:start position:0%
to then create
the

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
basis for the default budget and then
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
sent that off to the
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee which is an official
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
budget committee in northampton to do
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do and now have a
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
default budget with an eight percent
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
is that possible so you're talking about
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
the budget you're proposing versus a
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
budget that's already been developed and
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
accepted so yes this says
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
parent three says less any reductions to
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
an appropriation the governing body made
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the proposed operating budget so my
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
question is could i have received an
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
eight percent increase
 
00:40:49.839 --> 00:40:50.790 align:start position:0%
eight percent increase
to

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
a operating budget and said
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
all good
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
yes and that won't change your default
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
budget because any new budget
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
moves forward through the processing and
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
i think this is the circle
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
continue to find myself in it
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about a proposed
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
budget eliminating reductions in a
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
budget that has not yet been approved in
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
a default budget that has already had
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
voter approval and they're kind of
 
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
completely two separate and distinct
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
budgets and points in time so
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
i i apologize if i'm not answering your
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative guthrie uh this
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
may thank you for taking my question
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
this may have already been answered but
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding that the default
 
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.870 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding that the default
budget

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
is only monitored if you will by dra
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
um i would have to defer to dra for the
 
00:41:59.109 --> 00:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
term monitoring um it's certainly up to
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
the community to
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
fill out the form and submit it to the
 
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.790 align:start position:0%
fill out the form and submit it to the
dra

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
and of course they have a internal
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
system but i cannot speak to that i
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
apologize uh follow up with you
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
maybe i didn't ask the question
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
properly isn't it a fact
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
that if the governing body
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
puts together a default budget
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is submitted to dra
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
that that very well could be the end of
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure i understand your
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
question but we do have a dra
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative here who may or may not
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that i i don't want to
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
misspeak on behalf of a state agency
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
just a clarification i'm sorry i'm
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
asking the same question
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to uh if you will
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that in fact the
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
default budget
 
00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.990 align:start position:0%
default budget
really

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
no but nobody outside of the governing
 
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.589 align:start position:0%
no but nobody outside of the governing
body

00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
has any control over the default budget
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
in fact it goes forward
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
there is no am i correct when i say
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
there really is no process
 
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.950 align:start position:0%
there really is no process
to

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh assure that the fall budget does not
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh under the control of the governing
 
00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:24.790 align:start position:0%
uh under the control of the governing
body

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.910 align:start position:0%
body
so

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll go back to again
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
the control of the default budget
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
occurred in the previous
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
budget cycle with the legislative body
 
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.670 align:start position:0%
budget cycle with the legislative body
and

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
i agree that it's a complicated
 
00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
calculation that towns have to go
 
00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.470 align:start position:0%
calculation that towns have to go
through

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
but they are required to notice
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
a detailed default budget right
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
alongside their their proposed budget so
 
00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
they have to have a completely separate
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
line by line default calculation so
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
again that could be questioned at any
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
time through the budget process which is
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
an open and public and transparent
 
00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.829 align:start position:0%
an open and public and transparent
process

00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
so usually starting in november and
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
december that is being looked at very
 
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.309 align:start position:0%
december that is being looked at very
carefully

00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
to their side i just want to be sure to
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
to clarify that it is
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
it is not up to the governing body the
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
default budget it is up to them and
 
00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
their staff to make sure the calculation
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
is correct but again it was already
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislative body and
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's a fully transparent
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
process and you can you have to present
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
the default budget line by line not just
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
a number to the legislative body when
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
you go to vote so they can see
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
apples to apples what has changed or
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
what has not changed sir
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
guthrie let me suggest that we bring dra
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
up and have them
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
questions i think i think they'll give
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
you some more details
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr jim i'm sorry dad thank you
 
00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%

you're welcome
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
so mr newer if you would uh come up and

and join miss hector
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
at the front table in the meantime
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative power you had a follow-up
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my second question
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
so this is for the new hampshire
 
00:45:13.599 --> 00:45:14.870 align:start position:0%
so this is for the new hampshire
municipal

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
municipal
association

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
i unfortunately missed with the prime
 
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.910 align:start position:0%
i unfortunately missed with the prime
sponsor

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
his comment with regard to line 23
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
and the strikeout of rsa 197 colon six
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
is that with regard is that a
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
an era scribner's error that they're
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
they're fixing now is that
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
reference petition warren articles could
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
you comment on the
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
validity of that
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
change there it appears that that is a
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
an rsa that deals with school districts
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
so it should be considered whether you
 
00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
would like that rsa stricken from this
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
law as it pertains to school districts
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
but i i can't speak to that further i
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
so we have a representative from dra
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
here could you introduce yourself and uh
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
could you tackle the question from
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie certainly uh for
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
the record my name is bruce kenour i
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
serve as the supervisor of the municipal
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
bureau at the department of revenue
 
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.150 align:start position:0%
bureau at the department of revenue
administration

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
and if i may mr chairman yeah
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
coming forward i'm trying to
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
if you will i'm trying to
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
establish the fact that the
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
default budget
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
is under the control of the governing
 
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:34.870 align:start position:0%
is under the control of the governing
body

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
and then in fact they can put before
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
the legislative party
 
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
the legislative party
there

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
default budget
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that although it goes
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
it eventually goes to the dra
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
that that kind of oversight by the dra
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
the governing
 
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.309 align:start position:0%
the governing
uh

00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
body that will determine what the
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
default budget is i don't know if that's
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
clear enough i'm just trying to
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that that there is not
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
very much control
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
over the dra over the default budget by
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
anybody other than the governing body if
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
the border selectmen or the school board
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
says that this is the default budget and
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
it gets into
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
if you will a skunk contest because i
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
can't use the
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
when it gets push and shove it's the
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
governing body that says i want to
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
include this in my default budget
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
you are correct there's nothing in
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
statute that gives the department of
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
revenue authority to review or approve a
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
default budget we see the information go
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
by because with the advent of the tax
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
portal back in 2015
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
as a municipality constructs
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
its budget it's doing so in that
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
computer portal
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
knows that it's an sb2 governed
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
municipality or school district so
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
before it lets it finish the work
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
of inputting all the data and producing
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
the actual budget form that needs to be
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
signed and posted it alerts the
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
municipality to school district and says
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
you can't finish because you're sb2
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
you need to complete a default budget
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of our involvement we
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
have no jurisdiction to look at it
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
i will say that
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
one to clarify one point now catherine
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
had mentioned about the sanctity of the
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
default budget it's created and there it
 
00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.069 align:start position:0%
default budget it's created and there it
is

00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's one wrinkle in the law again we
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
we only know this at dra because we're
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
peppered by questions and have to say
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing we do not
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
evaluate or approve them
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
at a deliberative session
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
there can be discussion about the
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
default budget there can be
 
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.230 align:start position:0%
default budget there can be
argumentation

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
argumentation
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
but there's no power of the legislative
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
body to amend however
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
before the default budget number goes on
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
the official ballot
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
this little section in 4013 says that um
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
this amount that would be the default
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
budget amount shall not be amended by
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
the legislative body that catherine's
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
point however this amount may be
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
adjusted by the governing body
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
and then if it's the school board or the
 
00:49:36.549 --> 00:49:36.559 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen unless those entities
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
have voted to give such authority to to
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
a budget committee
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's rare
 
00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.270 align:start position:0%
that's rare
so

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
the governing body
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
acting on relevant new information at
 
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
any time before the ballots are printed
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
providing the governing body and
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
completes an amended budget form so at
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
deliberative if there is great
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and argumentation about the
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
default budget amount
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
the governing body listening to that
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
has the authority before they send it to
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
the printer for the ballot
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
they can
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
create a different default budget amount
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
they'll go through the portal again
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
create it
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
so there is one slight moment
 
00:50:18.559 --> 00:50:19.270 align:start position:0%
so there is one slight moment
where

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
a default budget amount could change the
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
other thing that we have witnessed we
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
have no part in it we're not a party to
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.870 align:start position:0%
any of the
litigation

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
but in 2016 and then again in 2017 there
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
were superior court decisions
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
about the validity of the construction
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
of a default budget
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
one was timely enough that it actually
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
was ordered by the court that the entity
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
would go back and do it again
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
and one wasn't timely enough but the
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
court did weigh in
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
on it so there's that um
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
i won't say ability to amend but perhaps
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
the incentive
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
to um uh not have to amend it by court
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
order so those that sits there
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
but certainly i want to confirm your
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
your conclusion
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
dra is not involved in the approval or
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
the review of these
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
and we always would do you know if we
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
get a question from an entity
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
we defer them back to their own legal
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
counsel to determine whether or not
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
they're constructing it according to the
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
law to the best of their ability
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i think they
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
clarified what i was looking for and i
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman sure
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
yes representative loseless
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
if we're in a period
 
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
if we're in a period
where

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
the demand for services
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
is going
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
down but the
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
let's say we have a
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment in a school system
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
but the school board is not inclined
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
and it comes to the deliberative session
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
and there's a great hubbub
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
about the fact that even though we have
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
the budget is still
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
you say that the school board
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
could if they
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
felt so inclined
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at the default
 
00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:36.309 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at the default
budget

00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
and reduce
 
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.549 align:start position:0%
and reduce
if

00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
is that what your testimony was
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
it's merely
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
a section of the existing law
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
easily easily enough
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
not seen
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
because it's so rare that anything can
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
touch that default
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
budget number but there is that small
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
window in the law where yes the
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
governing body which created it to begin
 
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
governing body which created it to begin
with

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity after
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
if they're persuaded
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
and then that's a dra has no position on
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
whether they should shouldn't or
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
anything else but it's there follow-up
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
i submit to you
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
that the reason that is so rare
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
is that the school boards in this case
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm merely using that as an example
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
are never inclined to reduce their
 
00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
are never inclined to reduce their
budget

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.549 align:start position:0%
budget
that

00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:34.559 --> 00:53:36.069 align:start position:0%
that
they

00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
they if the operating budget is
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
disapproved oh well
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's when if we get it approved and when
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
if we don't
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
because the default budget is higher
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
so i submit to you that
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
in in those sets of circumstances
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
if the school board is so inclined that
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
well i have in the department we have no
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
position on the inclinations of the

um
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i can
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
respond let me say you don't have to
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
answer that because i don't think
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative lasallis really asked you
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
a question i think he's
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
what you're hearing is some frustration
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
coming from him
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
with the government that he's observing
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
like i said this is an abstract
 
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.910 align:start position:0%
like i said this is an abstract
subject

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
and i might be oversimplifying this
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
but the default budget is defined in
 
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.030 align:start position:0%
but the default budget is defined in
statute

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
and on line four it says
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that it says in the
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
operating budget authorized for the
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
and then the subsequent lines go on to
 
00:55:01.599 --> 00:55:02.789 align:start position:0%
and then the subsequent lines go on to
further

00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
um explain or define how that
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
calculation shall be made
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
and so currently in statute there's two
 
00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.990 align:start position:0%
and so currently in statute there's two
provisions

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
in which that default budget that was
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
authorized i didn't mean default budget
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the previous year's budget
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
that had been authorized previously can
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
be reduced or increased
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
by um
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
as defined in in sections one and two so
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
can not the legislature
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
um redefine and and further add
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
provisions by which
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
it would be your prerogative to do so as
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
a policy position representative
 
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.549 align:start position:0%
a policy position representative
follow-up

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:53.750 align:start position:0%
follow-up
therefore

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
it is not lines nine through ten um
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
you know valid
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's redefining how the default budget
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
shall be calculated
 
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.270 align:start position:0%
shall be calculated
um

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
i would note representative that i think
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
the historical
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
record indicates those court cases
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
did precisely that
 
00:56:17.119 --> 00:56:17.910 align:start position:0%
did precisely that
uh

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
past sessions have amended this section
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
of law
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
one of which was if i'm not mistaken it
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
was the 2016 case was about contracts
 
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
and the next session
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
will add language about uh inclusion or
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
or not of contracts so
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
to a second if you will catherine's view
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
of course we would
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
defer to the legislature about what the
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
law would be or could be
 
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
law would be or could be
good

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
hi um
 
00:56:53.599 --> 00:56:54.390 align:start position:0%

how it's spelled certainly first name is
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay thanks you're welcome
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%

representative dolan yes may i just let
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
the committee know that um in our budget
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
faq from nhma it does cite some of the
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
legal court cases that have come to pass
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
for for your reference and i'll leave
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
that for your review thank you yeah i do
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
remember the uh
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
the output of the the contracts
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
controversy uh
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
that was very uh
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
very well publicized so
 
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.750 align:start position:0%
very well publicized so
yes

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
mr chairman at the risk of being a
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
glutton for work punishment
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
i would note about three four years ago
 
00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
and i do not remember who someone in the
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
legislature asked
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
in effect my desk to look at what
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
happened the prior year in sb2
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
situations in other words was the
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
default budget higher or lower than the
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
recommended operating budget
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
and what was the outcome
 
00:58:21.119 --> 00:58:22.710 align:start position:0%
and what was the outcome
um

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
i i'm not asking to do it again but if
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
there is a need somehow to determine
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
that disparity and calculate or those
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
values leads to any kind of um obvious
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
voting pattern
 
00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.470 align:start position:0%
voting pattern
uh

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
it could we could put that together
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
well um if you already did it once
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
instead of doing it again could you just
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
send us the
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
previous one
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i could find
 
00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:00.470 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i could find
my

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet as it were i can tell you
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
what i concluded i looked at it and i'm
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
not a statistician but there was nothing
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
that jumped off the page that said
 
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.030 align:start position:0%
that jumped off the page that said
anything

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
was dramatically happening
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
whichever way the the two numbers
 
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.950 align:start position:0%
whichever way the the two numbers
rested

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
rested
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't meant to be a truly
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
scientific quantitative analysis but it
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
was just a look
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
so if i can
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
would i send that
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes please send it to me and uh i'll
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
copy the
 
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.670 align:start position:0%
copy the
committee

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much that
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
concludes our hearing on house bill
 
00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:38.309 align:start position:0%
concludes our hearing on house bill
1070.

00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
1070.
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we had by the way
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
we had 11 people registered they were
 
00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
for the bill and 28 opposed it
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh on the uh on online
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
testimony submissions i have a couple of
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
people that have registered twice
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't tell me who they're
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
representing whether it's a town and or
 
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.630 align:start position:0%
representing whether it's a town and or
themselves

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
so i think you're getting a different
 
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.630 align:start position:0%
so i think you're getting a different
printout

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
repeated voted one actually
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
voted supported enough
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
so okay so it's just really to give us
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
an indication of
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
what the general thing is so i'll just
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
give you the
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
real number not with any manipulation of
 
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
i'll ask if there's
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in the audience that would like
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%

01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee

sorry i uh
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
look for the confusion i have a exec
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
session going in the other in my
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
committee and so i'm trying to
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
juggle both um
 
01:02:56.799 --> 01:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
juggle both um
so

01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
we got we are on um hb
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh 1087.
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
relative to zoning uh single family
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
housing lots and this is um a little bit
 
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.670 align:start position:0%
housing lots and this is um a little bit
of

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.630 align:start position:0%
of
a

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
similar topic of a bill that
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
i believe the this committee may have
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
retained or killed last year
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot size
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
lot size requirements for
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:39.140 align:start position:0%
a combined res
 
01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.950 align:start position:0%
a combined res
[Music]

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:43.490 align:start position:0%
water sewer treatment
 
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:45.029 align:start position:0%
water sewer treatment
[Music]

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:45.039 --> 01:03:46.470 align:start position:0%
[Music]
and

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
so then
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
so there was some discussion about the
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
language and how
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.150 align:start position:0%
it would
um

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:56.870 align:start position:0%
um
be

01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
affecting uh towns and so this new
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
language under online eight and nine
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
says that uh lots
 
01:04:05.039 --> 01:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
says that uh lots
uh

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
the lot or lot does not exceed the um
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
existing municipal or county uh
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
community water and sewer infrastructure
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that um
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure is
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
has the capacity to have the additional
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
lots on it and um
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.309 align:start position:0%
and also
uh

01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
the there is a change from the quarter
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
acre requirement to the one uh 10 000
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
acre requirement
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
as the maximum and that was um discussed
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
with a number of the representatives and
 
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
with a number of the representatives and
uh

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
over the summer to try and come with
 
01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
come up with language that would be able
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
there is uh
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
online 10 through 12. it's
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
just saying that this is um
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
limit kind of the the requirements of of
 
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
limit kind of the the requirements of of
group

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
what is that called um
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh like high density housing
 
01:05:20.079 --> 01:05:21.270 align:start position:0%
uh like high density housing
requirements

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully that this this bill as
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
drafted the language is more amenable to
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
the committee it's really the same
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
kind of topic it's just uh
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
trying to clean up the
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
you willing to take language questions
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
from the committee absolutely
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
anyone have questions for representative
 
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
anyone have questions for representative
ocala

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
ocala
 
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.190 align:start position:0%
ocala
yes

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely um i
 
01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
do have a little bit of concern with the
 
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
do have a little bit of concern with the
new

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh number two friends number two
 
01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.470 align:start position:0%
uh number two friends number two
because

01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a chicken and egg
 
01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.829 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a chicken and egg
thing

01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
would you say that
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
if a
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
if a town is already at maximum
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
water and sewer capacity then no
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
new buildings can be built that's no
 
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.510 align:start position:0%
new buildings can be built that's no
so

01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so this is
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
regarding lots
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
size and so it would be
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
um so this is in relation to creating a
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
new lot this is what when this would
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
come into play so if there are um you
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
know the there are
 
01:06:34.559 --> 01:06:36.630 align:start position:0%
know the there are
f

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
f
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
10 lots on this community's sewer and
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
water and this
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
the com the community sewer and water
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
can only
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
hold or support
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
10 buildings then adding an additional
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
one would be one that exceeds the
 
01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:52.390 align:start position:0%
one would be one that exceeds the
current

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
ability so that lot would not fall under
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
this requirement and they could still
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
require whatever acreages that they
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
that their normal requirements would be
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you yes thank you
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here thank you
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
next up we have
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
chris norwood welcome mr nolan thank you
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh i'm here today representing the new
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of realtors
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
and uh just calling up some bullet point
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
notes that i have on my phone
 
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.430 align:start position:0%
notes that i have on my phone
um

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
realtors is supportive of this bill um
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that the uh
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
the main crux behind the bill or the
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
hopeful results of the bill will lead to
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
more housing and i won't uh bore
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
everyone with housing statistics i think
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
we all know the challenges that we face
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
today in our state with housing and its
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
impact on our economy
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
um we do believe that if there is a
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
municipality that has a public water and
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
public sewer system
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
that uh it would be behoove the
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
communities to
 
01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
allow for a denser population in those
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
in those environments down to the 10 000
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
square foot lot size as uh
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
as noticed in the bill
 
01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
um so just a couple quick things that
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
kind of two takeaways that i want to
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
impart upon the committee the first
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
thing is historically how did we get to
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
our current lot size in the various
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
most municipalities will have a default
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
lot size of around two acres and i think
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
that most folks are familiar with that
 
01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:52.390 align:start position:0%
that most folks are familiar with that
concept

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
concept
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
there are some municipalities that have
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
higher lot sizes in some zones some that
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
say the lot size has to be all high and
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
dry you can't have wetlands as part of
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
your two to four or five acres we even
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
know of one municipality that has a 10
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
acre zone
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
so but how do we get to the two acre
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
size well the two acre size is really a
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
it's a geometry problem with your well
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
radius and your septic system and making
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure that typically on your average two
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
acre lot you have enough room for a well
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
a radius around that well and then a
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
place outside that radius to put a
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
septic system and if that system fails
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
to have another septic uh
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
area for a septic system
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
um so with all that said if you were on
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
municipal water and municipal sewer the
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
two acre lot size just doesn't meet the
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
historic reasons of why
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
the two acre lot size was kind of
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
became the foundation of our state so
 
01:09:51.669 --> 01:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
many years ago
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
and so that's just one consideration i
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
would like to leave you with
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
the other item that i would like to
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
leave you with is that there there are
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
have denser lots in their
 
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
more densely populated downtown
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
environments where municipal water and
 
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.669 align:start position:0%
environments where municipal water and
sewer

01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
sewer
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
is located i think that the challenge
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
that we have is that
 
01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
there is research uh done by the josiah
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
bartlett center and i'd urge everyone to
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
go to their website that would suggest
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
that um unfortunately we do have
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
communities that are not
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
doing their fair share as it relates to
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
putting on more housing stock in our in
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
our state and what we see bless you what
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
we see is that when
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
community a starts to
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
ratchet up their regulations in their
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
built environment the neighboring
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
communities follow suit because there's
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
a fear that if neighboring community a
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
isn't doing their fair share well
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
community b needs to pull up the
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
drawbridge as well
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
and we feel that a level set playing
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
field for those communities that do have
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
water and sewer uh we feel that this
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill is as a fair uh way to tackle the
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
issue and recognizing that not all
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
communities have a municipal water and
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipal sewer and with that mr
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
chairman i'll be happy to take any
 
01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
chairman i'll be happy to take any
questions

01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there with something that this
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
goes through
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that in the city of nash
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
we'd lose about six
 
01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:33.669 align:start position:0%
we'd lose about six
zoning

01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
locations from that but putting that
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
aside don't you fear
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
that some communities that do not have
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
municipal and water
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
would um be less likely to they're going
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
to try to stick with the sewer they're
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
going to try to stick with well water
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so on so that they don't
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
they won't fall into this if they try to
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
tie into a municipal water supply
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's a concern that i personally have
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative for the
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
question if i understand it correctly
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
your concern is that would
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities without private without
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer um
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
keep that status
 
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.470 align:start position:0%
keep that status
um

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes and no because my practice is uh
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate and in one of the
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
things that i think most municipalities
 
01:12:19.199 --> 01:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
things that i think most municipalities
like

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
is a as a commercial tax base
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
and many uses that i work with on a
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
need municipal water and sewer and if
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have municipal water and
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
sewer it's economically impractical uh
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
daycare uses most food service uses
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
these are uses that you can do on um on
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
a private system but if you have
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
domestics if you have it municipal
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
service of water and sewer
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
it becomes immensely easier so
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
i i hear clearly the concern
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh but i think then it would go to the
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
other property classifications
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
namely commercial uses
 
01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.790 align:start position:0%
namely commercial uses
where

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer really are
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
needed for economic growth and for that
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
diversification of one's tax base
 
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
is it true that um single family housing
 
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.310 align:start position:0%
is it true that um single family housing
lots

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
lots
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
are restricted to residential areas or
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
does that vary from municipality to
 
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.310 align:start position:0%
does that vary from municipality to
municipality

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes various municipalities have um
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
various zones
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would allow for either single
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
family or
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
commercial development or agricultural
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative manchapudi
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
i yield to representative vance she's
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
had her hand up before me
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:14:03.350 --> 01:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
representative man djibouti
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh am i correct
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
having you deal with real estate
 
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the dollars and cents am i
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
correct in understanding that the price
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
the raw price of the land
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
for a new single family house is about
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
20 percent of the sale price of the
 
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.790 align:start position:0%
20 percent of the sale price of the
house

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
so i i grew up at the kitchen table with
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
both my parents in real estate and that
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
was the old rule of thumb they always
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
taught me um
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's all over the map these days and so
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
i i think most builders still use 20 to
 
01:14:39.189 --> 01:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
25 as a rule of thumb
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
um but obviously the last 20 years and
 
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
even the last five has seen
 
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
inflationary numbers right follow-up uh
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
you're a co-sponsor right no you're not
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
okay not i i was just volunteering
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
because i care
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question is so if we take
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
the 20-25 even higher as being um the
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
cost of the of the raw land relative to
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
the sale price is it not true that the
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
larger the lot the larger the house you
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
have to build in order to not lose your
 
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.270 align:start position:0%
have to build in order to not lose your
shirt

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
shirt
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative for the
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
question and i think that that's what
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
we've seen in today's market is that
 
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
there is uh an arms race for larger and
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
larger homes
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh and the median home price today is in
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
excess of four hundred thousand dollars
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
i don't even know what a starter home is
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
considered these days
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
follow follow one more
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'll be done after this uh
 
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.510 align:start position:0%
i'll be done after this uh
so

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
if we agree that the sale price of the
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
home is directly tied to the price of
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
how likely is it that a builder is going
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
to buy a two acre lot and put a house
 
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
to buy a two acre lot and put a house
that

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
if we figure 200 a square foot
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
is going to cost 150 000 how likely is
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the and sale price will be 150
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars well it'll be the 150
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
plus whatever you paid for the land and
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely and there needs to be uh
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
finance charges uh the the developer is
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
entitled to a profit for the risk of all
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
their capital outlay and so forth so
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the broker fee there's got to be a
 
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
broker fee in there representative uh
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
but although i use tongue-in-cheek no i
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
think that the the result of your
 
01:16:26.229 --> 01:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
question yes the uh the land value is
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
directly tied to the value of housing
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of variables today
 
01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
with uh increased lumber prices
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
increased labor prices but clearly
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
clearly the values of the land
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
is derived from the lack of supply that
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have out there
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative manchin foodie
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question sorry i had a brain
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
brain cap
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.910 align:start position:0%
my question is
um

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
lot size dictates the size of the house
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it also dictates the
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
the covenant with each development the
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
developer brings that
 
01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
also dictates some of the
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
structure and
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
setting and whatever the cost of the
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
house depends on the
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
how would this affect
 
01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:30.470 align:start position:0%
how would this affect
and

01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'll add one more thing to that with the
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
covet situation where
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know home office would not consider
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
commercial single family
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
we had three people working from home
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
home office is all virtual they don't
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
have a space to go
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so would that change
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh with this
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
single family and not for commercial or
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
office purposes
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
question uh so i live in an urban
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
environment where my house lot
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
if i recall is like point
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
two acres right so that's about uh
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a little bit smaller right and
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
and there's a generous size house on
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
that i will say we do not have the home
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
office i work from the bed uh when i'm
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
working from home um but i do think that
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
you can you can afford to put a decently
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
sized square foot home provided that
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
there are not other regulations such as
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh onerous side and front yard setbacks
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that if uh in a bill
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
such as this were enacted i don't think
 
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
that you need uh two acres to have a
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
a size house that is presently in demand
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the market i think uh we've often
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
referred to the missing middle in our
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
housing supply and i think that this
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
bill would help
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
supply that missing middle and i would
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
also say it would help put those housing
 
01:19:02.159 --> 01:19:03.270 align:start position:0%
also say it would help put those housing
units

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
near the existing infrastructure of the
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
municipality typically water and sewer
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
is located near your
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
services that the community provides and
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think that that's where we would like
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
to see some additional development
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
more development in otherwise virgin
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
green space representative stavis
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think you just answered the question i
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
was going to ask but i'll give it a try
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
anyway i wanted to ask you about the
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
environmental impact
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
of large lot zoning
 
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.510 align:start position:0%
of large lot zoning
um

01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
 
allowing

01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:44.950 align:start position:0%
allowing
preventing

01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
cities and towns from limiting
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
from limiting lot size to larger lots
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
would have a positive impact on the
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
environment by taking up less green
 
01:19:56.239 --> 01:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
environment by taking up less green
space

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
impacting fewer wetlands
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
and keeping our state the beautiful
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
state that we all love
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
question i i don't think it's a matter
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
of of um
 
01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:11.510 align:start position:0%
of of um
having

01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.709 align:start position:0%
having
two

01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
two types of housing in contrast to one
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
another i think that both can exist at
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
the same time within this bill this bill
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
is simply saying that in our more
 
01:20:22.159 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
is simply saying that in our more
densely

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
densely
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh municipal water municipal sewer built
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
environment that we afford more density
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
in those areas
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
towns can still have
 
01:20:33.910 --> 01:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
their zoning elsewhere outside of the
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
water and sewer district
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
that may afford the two acre zoning that
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
i otherwise would have mentioned there
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
is a need for it to have the well radius
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
but i would say what i previously stated
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
is yes it makes a lot more sense i think
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
those municipal services ambulatory uh
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
fire police the denser populations to be
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
located in that area with the water and
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
sewer i think makes sense from a uh
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
from a policy
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
development perspective
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
no more questions uh
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh oh we have one more
 
01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
i'm going to uh oh we have one more
question

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just my standard could you please
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
repeat your name just for note-taking
 
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.229 align:start position:0%
repeat your name just for note-taking
purposes

01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%

01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
certainly uh chris norwood
 
01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.590 align:start position:0%

c-h-r-i-s-n-o-r-w-o-o-d

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question so thus far the
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
conversation has been centered around
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
lots that are owned by a developer
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
is it true that if an individual
 
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
is it true that if an individual
purchase

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
purchases a lot and they own the lot
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
then they can
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
build whatever size
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
home they want on that lot
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes so this doesn't have to be a
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
developer taking a
 
01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.350 align:start position:0%
developer taking a
single

01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
one acre lot and splitting it up into
 
01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.229 align:start position:0%
one acre lot and splitting it up into
four

01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
this could be
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
a homeowner who owns a piece of land or
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
the homeowner themselves owns an acre
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
and they wish to sell off
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
a quarter acre so that they can retire
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
by building a house on a quarter acre
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
that they can retire next to where they
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
raise their children um and there's a
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion taking place within
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
the real estate community about retiring
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
in place and how difficult it is in our
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
state so i hope that answers the
 
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair nate graves from the
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
we do oppose this bill um we have a
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
policy at the uh
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
adopted policy for um this biennium that
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
we support long-standing authority of
 
01:22:58.470 --> 01:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate land use
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
matters with minimal interference from
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
and we oppose statewide land use
 
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.629 align:start position:0%
and we oppose statewide land use
mandates

01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
as far as practical considerations go
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
the one that i could identify was the
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
spoke about earlier which is
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
it may be the case that there is less
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
incentive for municipalities to build
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
out water and sewer infrastructure and
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.669 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
questions

01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:26:26.229 --> 01:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
also i'm not sure that this is
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
her occupied dwelling yeah
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
this is correct um
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
so my my
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
in kind of uh
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
you may be noticing a pattern with my
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
bills in that they are trying to
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of housing i
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
the previous and one of the previous
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned i live on a very
 
01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:58.629 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned i live on a very
small

01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
lot um
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
just like they do and
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
my house was affordable because of that
 
01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:08.709 align:start position:0%
my house was affordable because of that
um

01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:08.719 --> 01:27:10.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
for me to sell and and try and find
 
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
another comparable lot i don't actually
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
think that it would be possible um
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
because they're not being built because
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's not allowed anymore and so i'm just
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
trying to um say
 
01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.470 align:start position:0%
trying to um say
um

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of uh my philosophy is like
 
01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
there is there is a limit on what the
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a balance of
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
um people's property rights to be able
 
01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:40.870 align:start position:0%
um people's property rights to be able
to

01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
and and um
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
the state interest in saying hey we're
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
going to you know do we're going to
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
require 10 parking spaces we're going to
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
require 100 lot or 100 acres
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know these are burdens on those
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
those homeowners and
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a compelling state
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
interest before we start um limiting
 
01:28:04.639 --> 01:28:06.310 align:start position:0%
interest before we start um limiting
people's

01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
people's
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
um ability to use their
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
their lot their
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
houses their lots their
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
property in the way that they seek to
 
01:28:17.199 --> 01:28:19.110 align:start position:0%
property in the way that they seek to
and

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm suggesting here that
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
um you know there is an opportunity for
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
over regulation in this this space that
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
will once again increase the cost of
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
housing in this state which we all know
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
is a big issue and so
 
01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.830 align:start position:0%
is a big issue and so
um

01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
my hopes is that you would be able to
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
support um either
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
this or even um you know amending it to
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
two lots if that's what the committee
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
says but this that there should be some
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines that it's not the wild wild
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
west that you can just regulate you can
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
the legislative body can just make up
 
01:28:58.229 --> 01:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
whatever rules that they want and place
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
it on those um homeowners
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
in that in their area and so that's
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's two-part question sure one i see
 
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.669 align:start position:0%
it's two-part question sure one i see
you're

01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
where you're going with all your bills
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
right in terms of
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
trying to increase the density increase
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
in our communities
 
01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
in our communities
and

01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
by reducing the parking
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
is the intention
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
to provide more walkable livable
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
communities which is not car dependent
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
community that way
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
it makes
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
building communities not building just
 
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
building communities not building just
homes

01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think that
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes if you have a current setup which is
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
forcing large parking lots um then
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to put that out
 
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.390 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to put that out
in

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know far away from the normal
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
services and it's going to be harder for
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
people to to work and play in those
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
areas and if and there are certain
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
people that you know want start starter
 
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.510 align:start position:0%
people that you know want start starter
um

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
homes and and are
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
in in an environment that maybe they
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of people that are
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to be coming to their business or
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
i wanted to be able to um
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
you know there there's a development in
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
my town right now that has an apartment
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
complex and they're going way above the
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
number of parking spaces that is
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
required by our town and that should be
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
completely allowed but in this
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they're targeting a different
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
audience right with the with the and and
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
maybe it's
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
someone that you know they have a bus
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
line or something right in front of the
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
place and so most of the people that
 
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're targeting are people that are
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
not home or not car owners or or are
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do a more green or a biking
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
lifestyle or something like that and i
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
think that those people should be able
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
to um target those people if they uh you
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
know service that community and not um
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
artificially inflate the size of the lot
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
the size of the uh development and the
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the cost of the development so that
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
those people that want that lifestyle
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to benefit from the
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
cost rece savings of having smaller
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
parking lots and you know the plow
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
requirements that come with that and
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so and and the
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance and and repaving and stuff i
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
think that that's
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
all something that you know as someone
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
someone they
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
could consider biking to work
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
might not want to have to pay for all of
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
that and and maybe they should be able
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
to uh benefit from that
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
in that situation but it wouldn't fit
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
every development right it would just
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
keep that that option open for those
 
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
keep that that option open for those
people

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question you
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
stated a little while ago that needs to
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
be a compelling statewide interest to do
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
this i'm curious why
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
in my town which has two acre zoning and
 
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.709 align:start position:0%
in my town which has two acre zoning and
has

01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
um has adopted ordinances for parking
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
requirements based on setbacks and our
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
stated values for
 
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.270 align:start position:0%
stated values for
wetlands

01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
wetlands
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
preservation of the environment
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
why there should be a compelling
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
statewide interest that overrides
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
my local interest on how to govern my
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
govern my own town
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think you
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
miss um quoted me i didn't say statewide
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
i said it's compelling state interest so
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
it would be you know the
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
if if it was let's say a wetland issue
 
01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:51.990 align:start position:0%
if if it was let's say a wetland issue
then

01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
then
um

01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
they're i
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
not sure how how increased parking helps
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
helps the wetland but um
 
01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
helps the wetland but um
um

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:02.159 --> 01:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
the uh i do think that
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some balance between
 
01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:11.430 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some balance between
um

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
if the if the
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
town says you know
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
we need a
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
one mile buffer between
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
the wetlands and everything then should
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
that be allowed i don't i don't think
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate and so that's i think
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
that there's needs to be some boundaries
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
this is what
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
um you know when we say yes you can have
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
local control but it needs to be within
 
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.709 align:start position:0%
local control but it needs to be within
some

01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
some reasonableness is kind of more my
 
01:33:43.110 --> 01:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
my state
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
my um position and not that you can put
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
a one mile mile buffer around wetlands
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a thing so thank you
 
01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
 
01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
um

01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
hi yeah thanks for
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill and
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
so i actually have my own legislation
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
um regard that
 
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.910 align:start position:0%
um regard that
addresses

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
um parking minimum requirements um
 
01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.470 align:start position:0%
um parking minimum requirements um
except

01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
except
 
01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:13.270 align:start position:0%
except
um

01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
mine's more related to
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
um religious institution affiliated
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
projects um
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's hb1219
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering um
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
see this as
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
working together with that legislation
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
or is there any work we need to do to
 
01:34:33.679 --> 01:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
or is there any work we need to do to
harmonize

01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
harmonize
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
your bill with mine at all
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think that
 
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:41.669 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think that
um

01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly that that
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is kind of allowing
 
01:34:46.719 --> 01:34:47.590 align:start position:0%
legislation is kind of allowing
um

01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
kind of multi-use of the spot so if it
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
if it if you have um someone that's only
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
using the parking space on sundays and
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
only someone that's using the parking
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
space during the week why they should be
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
able to count
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
those equally um
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill would not
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
conflict with that in any way and
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
any movement on that um
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
sounds sounds reasonable to me and
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think that
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to work with the with the
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor or the committee in in
 
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
making it if they see a conflict but i
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see a conflict at this
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i i do have kind
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
of a couple of questions but um
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
one of my concerns about something such
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
as this nature is that it does take away
 
01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
that that local control and i'll give an
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
example and then ask you my question um
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
for instance nashua has a 1.5 parking
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
space per unit
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
um so in other words if there's five
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
apartments within one building
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's easier to say four apartments one
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
building they have to have six parking
 
01:35:55.520 --> 01:35:57.030 align:start position:0%
building they have to have six parking
spaces

01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
spaces
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we find that's not adequate
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
because most
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
most um dwellers seem to have two cars
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
especially if they're a married couple
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the case of in the case of nashua
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
they gave a special exemption for um
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
a place that wanted to build um with no
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
parking absolutely no parking no on
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
street parking no any kind of parking
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
they came they got their special
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
exemption because it was right in the
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
heart of downtown and they felt that
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
they were building to that type of
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
community that you were talking about
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
that would walk and so on don't you
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
think it it's better to allow the
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
communities to do this than to handicap
 
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.030 align:start position:0%
communities to do this than to handicap
them

01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
where someone's going to be putting in
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
home and there really isn't adequate
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
parking but where our hands are tied
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
because you only have to have one
 
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
parking space
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's my concern so wouldn't you say
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
that you really could be handicapping
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
a current municipality
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh as a zba
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
member i'm well aware of the um
 
01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.830 align:start position:0%
member i'm well aware of the um
the

01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
the requirements for uh
 
01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.350 align:start position:0%
the requirements for uh
zoning

01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions and
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
um it has to be uh
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
special to the lot some
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
certain characteristics that the lot has
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
that the things around it do not have
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
and in the example that i gave
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
for example was uh something along a bus
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
route or something like that there's um
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
the lot
 
01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.430 align:start position:0%
the lot
uh

01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
the surrounding lots obviously also are
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
really close to a bus route in that
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
example and maybe there is enough room
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
and so there's nothing
 
01:37:36.639 --> 01:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
and so there's nothing
specifically

01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
about that lot that makes not putting
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know 15 car lots or car spaces on
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
that lot it's just that they would
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
rather it be green
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
and they and that's the type of person
 
01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to target and so
 
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't qualify for a special
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
exception and that expense because they
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
they have the lot size they have there's
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
nothing special about that lot that
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
grants them an exception to the rule and
 
01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.350 align:start position:0%
grants them an exception to the rule and
so

01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
legislation like this helps to
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
focus the community on
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
what is really the goal and the
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
importance of the
 
01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.830 align:start position:0%
importance of the
um

01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
the regulation and say
 
01:38:22.719 --> 01:38:26.950 align:start position:0%
the regulation and say
um

01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
are we trying to
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that there is um
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and as i also said that they're you
 
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
and and as i also said that they're you
know

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
the developer kind of knows the kind of
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
their target audience and they're not
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
going to be able to sell to someone that
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
needs two cars if there's no parking
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
spaces right because that there will
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
be conflict and and people will
 
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.350 align:start position:0%
be conflict and and people will
um

01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:52.229 align:start position:0%
um
not

01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
not be satisfied with with that
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity and so
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
the i don't believe that we're going to
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
be building
 
01:39:01.199 --> 01:39:03.030 align:start position:0%
be building
um

01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
because of this bill in such a way that
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's not going to to be able to be sold
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
to the target audience and and that
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
those people will be satisfied with that
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
those people should have the option to
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do that and that um
 
01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
be able to do that and that um
i

01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
am not sure that if there is you know
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
a one-bedroom house or one or a studio
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
apartment that that
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
can really only
 
01:39:36.239 --> 01:39:38.310 align:start position:0%
can really only
um

01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
is targeted to single occupants that
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
they need to have
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
two to parking spaces for that and so
 
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's um kind of just uh
 
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh opening it up for those situations to
 
01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh opening it up for those situations to
be

01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
um allowed and not hindered by
 
01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.950 align:start position:0%
um allowed and not hindered by
um

01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
people being over aggressive in their
 
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.669 align:start position:0%
people being over aggressive in their
regulations

01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
well i guess my follow-up will be you're
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
talking about new development and i can
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
understand that the the the developer
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
should be planning
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
for his his or her target audience and
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i understand that but let's take um
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
a very large home
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to be converted into
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
multiple apartments or adus and so on
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
now you're putting the same restriction
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the municipality that they cannot
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
require more than
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
one space for occupy dwelling and i'm
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to take say that the the it being
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
separated into four
 
01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
separated into four
homes

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
means that they have to have four
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
parking spaces per year thing right so
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i i understand that i'm not saying
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
that the house itself only has one i'm
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
saying that the individual dwellings so
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
i do have that
 
01:40:51.109 --> 01:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
but what if
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
there is there they they are two bedroom
 
01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.950 align:start position:0%
there is there they they are two bedroom
apartments

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
that are going to be converted and trust
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
me i can tell you
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
we had we i have one in my
 
01:41:05.910 --> 01:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
and in my ward in my district that has a
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
a home that they convert into five
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
and one of them has five bedrooms
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
and bae is renting it out with buy
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
parking spaces
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm getting those calls that they're
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
getting tickets because there's not
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
adequate parking um and saying to the
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
city why aren't you giving me enough
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
parking so just putting that aside
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um aren't we
 
01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the new development
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
this this does only does not just act
 
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
for new development it also acts for
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
existing homes that could be converted
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
so this would be um
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
would be enforced when they're
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
um getting their essentially occupation
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
permit right and so if you got an if you
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
changed your setup of your lot to get
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
different occupation permits for each
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
um uh room of the
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
house then
 
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm not exactly sure and the example
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
that you gave if you already have like a
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
1.5 requirement in your town and you
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
they added
 
01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:16.229 align:start position:0%
they added
five

01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
they converted a house then they would
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
need like 10 15 parking spots or or
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
eight maybe to be between eight and ten
 
01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
parking spots and you're saying that
 
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.830 align:start position:0%
parking spots and you're saying that
they

01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
instead of parking in those parking
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
spots or maybe they park in those
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
parking spots and then park on the
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
street but the street parking is not
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
allowed let's say in winter and they're
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
getting ticketed and then the people in
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
that that were
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the are in the house renting are
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
complaining that they don't have enough
 
01:42:53.430 --> 01:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
parking spots so that they are getting
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
ticketed and that's unfair
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm confused as because if they
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
accepted that that there was only going
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
to be one parking spot then that's kind
 
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.109 align:start position:0%
to be one parking spot then that's kind
of

01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
up to them to ch to accept that mr
 
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
chairman clarify yes
 
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for my my confusing the way i
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
stated it um the
 
01:43:13.750 --> 01:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
the city approved
 
01:43:16.470 --> 01:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
for we'll say the four units six parking
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
spaces sure it's up to the landlord to
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
to deal those out accordingly right four
 
01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.270 align:start position:0%
to deal those out accordingly right four
apartments

01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
one of those apartments actually has
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
five bedrooms right
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
the landlord didn't say to those people
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
you only have x number of parking spaces
 
01:43:34.229 --> 01:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
they move in it's not in the it's not in
 
01:43:36.310 --> 01:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
the lease how many parking spaces they
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
see those that parking lot that's got at
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
least six i think in this particular
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
case i had seven parking spaces
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
they did not think oh they just figured
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're gonna have to buy for it in the
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
city of nashua we have a no parking
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
between midnight
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
and 4 a.m
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
because of safety of our high dense road
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
of our small roads and in high density
 
01:43:58.719 --> 01:43:59.430 align:start position:0%
of our small roads and in high density
so

01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm saying is for these
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
newer i agree with you for new
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
development it makes a lot of sense
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
but i i fear that we're having
 
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of homes that
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
could be converted
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
that was my question to you okay thank
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question i would
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
say um with the if the person moved in
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
that you know that could com entirely be
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
done you know the five bedrooms could be
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
filled up with you know two two adults
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
and five
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
three-year-olds that don't have any cars
 
01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:28.709 align:start position:0%
three-year-olds that don't have any cars
and

01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's just
 
01:44:32.629 --> 01:44:32.639 align:start position:0%
it could be all serviced by one van and
 
01:44:34.470 --> 01:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.590 align:start position:0%
so the the
the

01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:37.590 --> 01:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
so maybe that situation would be
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
completely adequate for a different
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
family but it just doesn't work for that
 
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
family and that family um you know has
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
five teenagers and all that they all
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
have their own car and
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
it it really just doesn't work for them
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that isn't the town's fault or it
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the homeowner's fault it's kind of
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
when you're doing your due diligence
 
01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
about fi you know living on a on a
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
property of
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
is this property going to suit my needs
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
and i would say that that is
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
not i i don't believe that it's the
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
town's fault i don't think that it's the
 
01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:08.870 align:start position:0%
town's fault i don't think that it's the
the

01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
regulations fault i think that it's just
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
poor planning by the people that rent it
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative yokola uh are you aware
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
of the work of the parking reform
 
01:45:31.119 --> 01:45:33.830 align:start position:0%
of the work of the parking reform
network

01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
oh but it sounds interesting
 
01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:36.709 align:start position:0%
oh but it sounds interesting
so

01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
the parking reform network is an
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
organization that's been looking at
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
questions of over parking requirements
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
excessive parking requirements in the
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
united states
 
01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:46.790 align:start position:0%
united states
and

01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
done is produce a map that shows places
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
that have changed their parking
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
requirements including the city of
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
buffalo new york a place where it snows
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
pretty often i think
 
01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.189 align:start position:0%
pretty often i think
and

01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
the city of buffalo is the most famous
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
example of a place that has completely
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
eliminated its parking requirements
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
which is not the same as completely
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
eliminating the parking yeah um and i
 
01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
guess my question is
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
why do you think that it works in
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
buffalo and might not work anywhere else
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i think
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
if there's a demand for parking that the
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
developer will develop the parking for
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
it you know and in some towns or in some
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
areas there is not enough parking and so
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
you find parking structures that are
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
paid and some places even pay up
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
for parking um
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
definitely in seattle and and stuff like
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
that and so
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think that parking is is you know
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
driven by the market and not and um
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a demand in the market i'm not sure
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
exactly the the
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
the government coming in and saying okay
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
nope nope you're
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
you need
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
additional parking
 
01:47:14.950 --> 01:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
i think that it will be solved by the
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
people that are demanding the parking
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
that either it will be parking
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
structures or
 
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.070 align:start position:0%
structures or
um

01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
or more bus lines and stuff like that or
 
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so i i'm not sure that it's a
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
government problem
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's possible that it
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
could work in many other places thank
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
next we
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
have oh i'm sorry representative
 
01:47:36.719 --> 01:47:38.470 align:start position:0%
have oh i'm sorry representative

01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking another
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you and you alluded to
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
your last comment was
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know demand for more parking
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
versus if the pr you know public
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
transportation or mass transportation is
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
available so the demand for
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
public i mean parking will go down
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be and you you know the
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
new millennial generation that's what
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
they want they want the smaller spaces
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
no parking uh
 
01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.109 align:start position:0%
no parking uh

thank you for the question i
 
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i
um

01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%

a first-time homeowner
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
not too long ago
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
price was a big factor in how whether or
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
not i was going to be
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
able to uh afford it and
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so size
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
and i did i you know definitely in in
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we are taxed bait uh in
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
large part um
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
by the size of our home and so
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
being able to reduce those to uh support
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
someone that is just starting out in the
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
workforce um
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
is is important and
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
whatever costs um
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
can be reduced so that someone could
 
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
that that houses that
 
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.390 align:start position:0%
that that houses that
um

01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
could be sold for 100 or 150 thousand
 
01:49:13.199 --> 01:49:14.470 align:start position:0%
could be sold for 100 or 150 thousand
dollars

01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.910 align:start position:0%
dollars
um

01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think those need to be considered
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question
 
01:49:22.229 --> 01:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you very much
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
representatives uh mr grace you're up
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace from the
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill um not not only do
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
we uh impose statewide zoning mandates
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
but i believe there's some practical
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
considerations in this particular case
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
i looked over the statistics provided by
 
01:49:49.990 --> 01:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
the u.s bureau of transportation
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
statistics bureau
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
or division
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
over the past 20 years and
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
uh they stated that
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh per household you know it ranges
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
slightly but the number of vehicles
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
owned per household ranges from 1.8 to
 
01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.149 align:start position:0%
owned per household ranges from 1.8 to
2.0

01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
2.0
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
um and that's over the last two decades
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
and so that really works out to be for
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
the average american owns
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
75 of a car
 
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
75 of a car
um

01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:17.430 align:start position:0%
um
realistically

01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's problematic because
 
01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
while we maybe
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
well some of the testimony today is
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%

focused on you know cases of starter
homes

01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
kind of first time home buying
 
01:50:29.679 --> 01:50:31.189 align:start position:0%
kind of first time home buying
situations

01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
as representative clee pointed out it's
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
certainly possible in communities for
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
which have parking requirements for
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
developers to decide they want to target
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
that demographic with their particular
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
building or building style
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore obtain either a special
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
exemption if that's available or a
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
variance to reduce the number of parking
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
spaces required
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
but if we look at the best use of that
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
property and what that might be used for
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know it may be the case that uh
 
01:51:03.750 --> 01:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood now is good for
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know first-time owners but later on
 
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
as it matures maybe it's better for you
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
know people who are retiring or
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
something like that or maybe it becomes
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know a new company comes into town
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh they
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
just you know people want to work there
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
and naturally as people progress through
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
lives they make they have relationships
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
they you know have other people live
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
so realistically i think we need to look
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
more at the household numbers and
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know if you have we don't have a
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
good public infrastructure uh for
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
transportation in this state or country
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
so realistically we do rely on cars
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
you know may or may not change in the
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
future but
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
we have to plan for now as well as the
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
future uh and it makes sense to to
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
require that the uh
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
the buildings that are built um the
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
dwelling units that are built actually
 
01:51:59.830 --> 01:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
have enough parking for the people who
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
occupy them now as well as may occupy
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
them in the future
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
much more in line with the local
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
considerations um
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
rather than a statewide mandate
 
01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:13.109 align:start position:0%
rather than a statewide mandate
because

01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the developer can come in
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know the local planning board
 
01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
will have some understanding based on
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
their their master plan based on other
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
information provided at the local level
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
for how that community has developed
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
over time how it predict how it may
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
develop in the future um and
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
provide sort of guidance for the best
 
01:52:35.109 --> 01:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
use of that property which is
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
going to include a certain number of
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
parking spaces
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
in most cases and i'm happy to take
 
01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:40.950 align:start position:0%
in most cases and i'm happy to take
questions

01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
van thank you chairman
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr grace uh is it not true
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
that this bill doesn't prevent a
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
developer or a builder or whomever from
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
providing as many parking spaces as they
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
think is necessary it only says that the
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
town or the city or the jurisdiction
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
can't require it
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
that is correct but i
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
i think an analogy here might be useful
 
01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:07.830 align:start position:0%
i think an analogy here might be useful
so

01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
in the late 80s and early 90s many
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
developers came in and as a cost savings
 
01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.430 align:start position:0%
developers came in and as a cost savings
measure

01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
measure
 
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
they decided to
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
retain when they built out subdivisions
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
they built up them as private roads in
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
20 years on we're seeing that
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
many people buying into these
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
communities weren't quite aware of that
 
01:53:25.599 --> 01:53:26.470 align:start position:0%
communities weren't quite aware of that
or

01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
they you know they are aware that they
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
pay some sort of community fee for
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
plowing and everything else but 20 years
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
on you need to replace those roads and
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
so all of a sudden they're hit with this
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
huge cost and so i think it's really
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
important we look ahead 20 years and say
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
well we can't really predict what's
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to happen but
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
presumably people still get married
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
presumably they still you know have to
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
go to work and they may need to drive we
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up
 
01:53:54.070 --> 01:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up uh mr grays
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the cost of a parking
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
space in the price of the house is about
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars per space does
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
that not affect the price of the of the
 
01:54:02.719 --> 01:54:04.870 align:start position:0%
that not affect the price of the of the
dwelling

01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
i agree that every every portion of the
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you thank you
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr graves thank
 
01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:19.030 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you mr graves thank
you

01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
that concludes our testimony for house
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
bill 1098
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to now open
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
testimony for house bill 1122 which is
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
authorizing municipalities to collect
 
01:54:33.669 --> 01:54:33.679 align:start position:0%
and resell construction and demolition
 
01:54:33.679 --> 01:54:35.270 align:start position:0%
and resell construction and demolition
debris

01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
debris
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh the prime is on his way
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
he's in executive session
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
and he's he's coming
 
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that okay well we take a five-minute
 
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.189 align:start position:0%
is that okay well we take a five-minute
recess

01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
recess
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
and reconvene at uh
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
my question is what if these people that
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
are living in these apartments are
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
shoot them
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative majori i can't believe
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
she said that
 
01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
she said that
really

01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
at one point um during something she
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
suggested that those villains be hoist
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
upon their patards
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
quoting from shakespeare which caused
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
many of us to then have to go look up
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
church in exeter that's being converted
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
to 11 dwelling units
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
well they don't have room to park
 
01:56:50.400 --> 01:57:09.350 align:start position:0%
well they don't have room to park
anymore

01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.360 --> 01:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
 
ugh

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh they only gave us one and she's
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
making copies for us
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
i have a feeling that there shouldn't be
 
02:00:18.719 --> 02:00:20.070 align:start position:0%
i have a feeling that there shouldn't be
much

02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you tim
 
02:01:01.030 --> 02:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes tim tim bean
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
got it okay we'll get you first thank
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:21.589 align:start position:0%
a little bit
okay

02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
maybe not that long so i think this next
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
the next bill we're going to hear is
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1122
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
which is authorizing municipalities to
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
collect and resell construction and
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill and begin the
 
02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:00.149 align:start position:0%
to introduce the bill and begin the
discussion

02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:02:00.159 --> 02:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
discussion
welcome

02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you committee
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
for hearing me on 11 22.
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
if i'm out of breath i'm running back
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
and forth to r and d where we're
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
executing bills up and down the hall
 
02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:19.270 align:start position:0%
executing bills up and down the hall
um

02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:21.350 --> 02:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
hospital 1122 relative to authorizing
 
02:02:23.830 --> 02:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to collect and resell
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris is a
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
bill that is important to protecting our
 
02:02:31.270 --> 02:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
environment minimizing solid waste in
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
our local landfills helping landowners
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
reduce new construction and renovation
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
costs supporting local home builders and
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
helping keep down the operational costs
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
of our communities transfer stations so
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
you may ask yourself how does collecting
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
and reselling construction demoly
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
demolition debris benefit our society
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
and save new hampshire residents money
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
well it allows construction and
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
demolition debris
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
to be sold it helps homeowners find
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
cost-effective building materials as we
 
02:02:59.430 --> 02:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
all know where housing boom and
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
materials are prices are rising and
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
reusable materials could be cost
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
effective to homeowners that are looking
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
to do construction
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
allowing conduct construction and
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
demolition debris also helps transfer
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
stations potentially raise new revenue
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
as they would have the option of
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
collecting and reselling this material
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
allowing collecting
 
02:03:23.669 --> 02:03:23.679 align:start position:0%
construction demolition degree also
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
forges partnerships with community home
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
builders and local contractors having
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
them understand and respect uh the
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
amount of
uh

02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of demolition debris that can
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
potentially go into landfills and figure
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
out better ways to reuse it
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
putting less
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
construction demolition debris into our
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%
solid waste stream will reduce town
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
transfer station tipping fees which
 
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully will then reduce property
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
taxes on towns
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
and less peaking fees and costs for
 
02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
transfer stations
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
can also help reduce town operation
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
costs because they'll see revenue from
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
potentially reselling this material
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly putting less construction
 
02:04:06.550 --> 02:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
demolition debris into our solid waste
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
stream lengthens the lifespans of our
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
existing landfills and reduces our needs
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
for new ones because we all no matter
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
where you live in the state no one wants
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
to see a new landfill built near them
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
and if we can do our best to reduce the
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
amount of waste going into them we
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
extend their lifespan
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
this is not a new idea the rest
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
repurposing of construction and
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
demolition debris is an action step that
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
was based on the direction of the
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
2019 findings report on the committee of
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
studying recycling streams and solid
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
waste management plan that the house
 
02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.189 align:start position:0%
waste management plan that the house
passed

02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
passed
 
02:04:43.510 --> 02:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it is an optional program it allows
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
for local governance where transfer
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
stations and oversight from their board
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
or town suck board or town
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
if they decide
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
if they decide to do it
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
how to do it when to do it to be able to
 
02:04:57.189 --> 02:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
engage in a reselling program
 
02:04:59.910 --> 02:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
i think uh this is a simple bill that
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
can have a tremendous impact and i thank
 
02:05:04.950 --> 02:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
you for your time and any
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
i interpret your questions
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
comment as being this is enabling
 
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
legislation this is most definitely
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
enabling regis legislation mr sheriff
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
 
02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:15.270 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
so

02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.229 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:16.239 --> 02:05:17.510 align:start position:0%
um
one

02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
constituent concern i heard earlier this
 
02:05:22.069 --> 02:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
year was about how
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
the state want to build a new
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric facility on the state
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
hospital grounds and
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
when i did some research into that
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
talked with some of the people involved
 
02:05:34.870 --> 02:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
i asked why they couldn't just
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
renovate one of
 
02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
renovate one of
the

02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
existing buildings on the state hospital
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
grounds for that purpose that i was
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
currently saying empty and they said the
 
02:05:46.390 --> 02:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because it's cheaper
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
to build a new building than it is to
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
rent to tear down or um to
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
tear out stuff inside of an existing
 
02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
tear out stuff inside of an existing
building

02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
put put in new stuff so
 
02:06:04.229 --> 02:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
would you see this bill as helping
 
02:06:04.239 --> 02:06:05.990 align:start position:0%
would you see this bill as helping
helping

02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
helping
 
02:06:09.430 --> 02:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
um that situation to um
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
like does it have to be demolition
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
debris from a completely demolished
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
building or just like one with stuff
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
torn out of it
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
i guess i can't speak to the
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
construction costs of original versus
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
renovated buildings but the material
 
02:06:24.629 --> 02:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
that can come out of it can be
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
repurposed in other construction
 
02:06:28.709 --> 02:06:28.719 align:start position:0%
ventures uh something important to make
 
02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:31.679 align:start position:0%
sure that i mentioned that only
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
construction licensed construction
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
companies in the town of the transfer
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
station can resell their debris to that
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
transfer station or
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners within that town that's a
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
transfer station overseas or the town
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
operations themselves you know if the
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
town decides to renovate a library or
 
02:06:48.719 --> 02:06:49.750 align:start position:0%
town decides to renovate a library or
school

02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:51.910 align:start position:0%
school
so

02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
renovated materials can help reduce
 
02:06:54.159 --> 02:06:56.069 align:start position:0%
renovated materials can help reduce
costs

02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
but i can't speak to the cost of new
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
construction versus old
 
02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to the hospital that
 
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
representative

02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
it is an enabling
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislation isn't and you confirm that
 
02:07:18.639 --> 02:07:19.510 align:start position:0%
legislation isn't and you confirm that
and

02:07:19.510 --> 02:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
with you know it's an ongoing uh dilemma
 
02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
or concern in a community
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
one the landfill then the leaching and
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
how it affects the water and
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
all that
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
are you
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
is is that an attempt to
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the landfill input and arrest it
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
and moving forward reduce the
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
debris or reuse repurpose
 
02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
debris or reuse repurpose
reuse

02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
reuse
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know reinvent
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
it is exactly the goal to reduce the
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
amount of solid waste going into a
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
landfill and
 
02:08:03.189 --> 02:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying we can't put this
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
there trying to create ways that can be
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
economically impacting positively
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
towns by creating new revenue
 
02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:15.679 align:start position:0%
business owners by being able to resell
 
02:08:17.669 --> 02:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
material that they may have spent time
 
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
and money on crews to pull the material
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
out of a building and then they can
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
value you know in blue slate windows
 
02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:24.229 align:start position:0%
value you know in blue slate windows
doors

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
doors
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
but it reminds me of the adage um when i
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
moved to new hampshire that my
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law said to me which is
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
land it's the only thing we making any
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
more of and so
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
while we can make new doors and windows
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
we can also repurpose them to preserve
 
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
the lands that we are not making any
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
other innovative ways of looking at
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipal solid waste and converting
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
that from waste to energy and completely
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
using net zero
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
i i am in fact i filed a bill this year
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
to allow for transfer stations to
 
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
optionally engage in a third party to um
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
create food waste compost and they would
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
be able to engage with a business that
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
turns that into biogas or farmers that
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
turn that into food
 
02:09:22.229 --> 02:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
feed for their hogs or livestock or
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
farmers that turn it into organic
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh fertilizer therefore putting less
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
chemicals in in food
 
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:31.280 align:start position:0%
from food waste into their lands for
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
fertilizing their
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
crops so yes this is this is all in that
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
same mindset for me of let's put less in
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
a landfill and let's make more value out
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the waste that we create one last one
 
02:09:47.589 --> 02:09:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you um that's compost the bio
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
compost and so the other kind of waste
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
that is non-compostable
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
debris and also bio waste which is now
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
incinerated so there is another
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
technology called the pyrolysis which
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
combines unsegregated waste
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
especially solid municipal solid waste
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
into energy and you know that is another
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
way of
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
reducing or repurposing and making
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
something positive out of it
 
02:10:20.550 --> 02:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
and not putting it in the landfill
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
correct and and i'll take that as a
 
02:10:24.709 --> 02:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
question as yes this would allow
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
transfer stations to explore
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities like that thank you
 
02:10:29.679 --> 02:10:32.149 align:start position:0%
opportunities like that thank you
representative

02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:10:39.030 --> 02:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
um maybe i'm missing it but i don't see
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
anything in 149 that prevents
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
towns from already doing this
 
02:10:48.550 --> 02:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
in your crafting of the bill did you
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
come across something that prohibits
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
towns from from doing what you're
 
02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
towns from from doing what you're
proposing

02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
they can collect but they can't resell
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
without authorization from the state is
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
what i was told by ols when i asked
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
specifically because it turns into a
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
financial transaction that the transfer
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
station has to be authorized to do right
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
now they can only take money from you
 
02:11:13.030 --> 02:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
dump your refrigerator you dump your
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know things that are larger
 
02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:18.950 align:start position:0%
you know things that are larger
television

02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
television
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
so for them to resell it to be able to
 
02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
say here are all the doors and we're
 
02:11:24.550 --> 02:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
gonna price them
 
02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
they have to be able to be authorized by
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
the town to do that
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.239 --> 02:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
in lines
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
four and five in your bill
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
you're limiting this to a project being
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
completed in town or from a general
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
contracting business which is based in
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
the town
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you had followed the
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
serious controversy that took place in
 
02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.870 align:start position:0%
serious controversy that took place in
claremont

02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
over the past year and a half
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
that had to do with a business in town
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
wanting to utilize
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
the incoming freight rail system
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
to bring construction debris into
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
claremont for the purpose of reselling
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
it now that was a business that was
 
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
located in claremont
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
but it was not using debris generated
 
02:12:18.239 --> 02:12:18.830 align:start position:0%
but it was not using debris generated
in

02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
claremont so would you be um
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment that kind of
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
encapsulated that concept here that that
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
made it clearer that even if you're a
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
business in town
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
you can't do this if you're trucking in
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
or freight training in
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of tons of of
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
commercial debris
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
ex so two questions one yes i would
 
02:12:47.270 --> 02:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
because it should be focused on new
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire businesses and new hampshire
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
residents and that was the
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
goal and second in allowing this
 
02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.830 align:start position:0%
goal and second in allowing this
optional

02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
optional
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation take place under
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
the control of the town select board
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
they would give those that agency the
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
sort of the rule-making requirements so
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
they could stipulate that it's only
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
construction debris originating but i
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
would actually have to inquire more
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
about that but i do agree
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
and understand your your question and i
 
02:13:21.669 --> 02:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
would be open if the committee felt that
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
it was worthwhile
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
um to amend it that way
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative for indulging um in
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
another question so this will enable
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services to
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
authorize these innovative ways of
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
reusing repurposing correct it would
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
allow the towns to engage in creating a
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
program with their transfer station to
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
it to work with
 
02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
landowners homeowners or businesses
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
based in the transfer station sphere of
 
02:13:57.199 --> 02:13:58.790 align:start position:0%
based in the transfer station sphere of
influence

02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
influence
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up yes go ahead uh
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
yeah in nashville we had swap shops you
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
know we would bring our stuff and people
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
would take what we didn't have and my
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
husband would bring back more
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh from you know books and uh stuff that
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know i would tell him don't come
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
back with more than what you took so
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
that was uh our saturday ritual
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
and so um
 
02:14:25.109 --> 02:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know that was no money exchange
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we had compost they would take the
 
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
compost and but we would get
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
compost back as residents right so this
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
will enable
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
the local municipalities
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
to put value to
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
my waist or my gar my trash is
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's treasure
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
correct they could decide whether they
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
want to put a value on it do they want
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
to create certain aspects that are in a
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
sort of a swap shop mentality um this
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
all region originated for me from a
 
02:14:58.880 --> 02:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
all region originated for me from a
um

02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
a business that was in littleton that
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
did that they actually took in and
 
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
did that they actually took in and
resold

02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
resold
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
um demolition debris
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
doors windows but
 
02:15:11.830 --> 02:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes they would say to you oh if
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
you have stuff that you want to trade
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
out we'll give you a financial value and
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
we'll write that off the cost of what
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
you want to acquire
 
02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
so again allowing the towns to figure
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
out what's appropriate for their
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
constituency with the transfer station
 
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
to then offer to those
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering i understand that this is
 
02:15:40.790 --> 02:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation but i'm curious to
 
02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:41.669 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation but i'm curious to
know

02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
do you know if there may be
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
a minimum tonnage or a minimum quantity
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
that is required by these recycling
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
outfits in order to
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
in order for them to accept the recycled
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
not recycled the the demolition debris
 
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
if if the quantity is is is small
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
will they still take it or do they will
 
02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
the town just wait till they get a
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
certain amount or
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
is it a possibility that it might end up
 
02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
in the landfill
 
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
well the receiver of the debris would be
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
the town transfer station not a not a
 
02:16:21.920 --> 02:16:23.109 align:start position:0%
the town transfer station not a not a
business

02:16:23.109 --> 02:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:16:24.870 --> 02:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
a construction business or a
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
construction vendor would go to the town
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
transfer station say hey i want to
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
utilize this
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
construction demolition debris program i
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of blue slate
 
02:16:35.359 --> 02:16:36.309 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of blue slate
and

02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
i want to get rid of it
 
02:16:40.950 --> 02:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
they'll put it and instead of charging
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
them a fee to stick it into the landfill
 
02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
they'll say we'll put it here
 
02:16:47.190 --> 02:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
and you don't pay a fee but we get to
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
sell it we get to create the revenue
 
02:16:51.509 --> 02:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
from it it doesn't cost you anything to
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
02:17:05.429 --> 02:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
my question is this not um analogous to
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh transportations collecting corrugated
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
cardboard and selling it to a recycler
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
corrugated cardboard glass aluminum they
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
do it
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
right some of some of them even do it
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
with tree waste and and turn it into
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
chipped wood for their own
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
mulching and parks and
 
02:17:27.589 --> 02:17:27.599 align:start position:0%
and cemeteries but this then expands the
 
02:17:27.599 --> 02:17:28.709 align:start position:0%
and cemeteries but this then expands the
opportunity

02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up so really all we're saying
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
here is instead of having to sell
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the valuable waste is to a
 
02:17:37.669 --> 02:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
third-party recycler we can just sell it
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the transfer station to ivy van who
 
02:17:41.750 --> 02:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
needs a new door
 
02:17:43.990 --> 02:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
correct they could decide to do that or
 
02:17:45.589 --> 02:17:45.599 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to work with a business
 
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
that did collect renovated doors or
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
windows and resell them in a shop
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere they could do that too again
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
it gives the town the opportunity to
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
turn what solid would be solid waste
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
into potential into revenue
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr taran thank you
 
02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at uh further down section
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
149 m19 which allows for regionalizat
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
regional cooperation
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you considered whether
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
or not see this is limited to towns
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
should this be amended could this be
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
amended in some way
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
where you provide for the regional
 
02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:26.870 align:start position:0%
where you provide for the regional
cooperation

02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
to allow for each one of those towns
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
that have signed into that agreement to
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
be able to do this because my concern is
 
02:18:38.549 --> 02:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
that if town a adopts this but town b
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
did not adopt this and was required to
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
their cooperative agreement might find
 
02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:44.639 align:start position:0%
them in court saying what are we
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to do i may be in the weeds i'm
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
just wondering if that's something that
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
should be considered or if you have
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
considered that um based on a little of
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
my i'll say my research um
 
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:56.790 align:start position:0%
my i'll say my research um
so

02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
some of this came from three of the
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
towns that i oversee as a grafton two
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
rep of uh sugar hill franconia and
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
easton who have a cooperative transfer
 
02:19:05.910 --> 02:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
station and they actually have a
 
02:19:08.389 --> 02:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
cooperative board that oversees those
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
agreements so any
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh development of the program would have
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
run through the entity that oversees the
 
02:19:17.349 --> 02:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
transfer station if i remember it
 
02:19:17.359 --> 02:19:18.549 align:start position:0%
transfer station if i remember it
correctly

02:19:18.549 --> 02:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
in there's a representative of each town
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
on the transfer station board
 
02:19:25.750 --> 02:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
from the select board so
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is sort of
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
already built into the way
 
02:19:30.319 --> 02:19:31.589 align:start position:0%
already built into the way
that

02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
multi-town transfer stations already
 
02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:34.309 align:start position:0%
multi-town transfer stations already
already

02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:19:35.910 --> 02:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
set up
 
02:19:38.309 --> 02:19:38.319 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative oh
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
i'm representing trip
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
no i'm just getting ready for sure

thank you so much and thank you for your
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%

02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
wipes to clean the area in front of you
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
or your microphone
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
there we go uh yes my name is john
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
tuthill i'm from akwas new hampshire in
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
sullivan county
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
and a former member of the environment
 
02:20:36.630 --> 02:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
and agriculture committee
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
years ago when we were working on solid
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
waste issues and construction and
 
02:20:42.070 --> 02:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
demolition debris
 
02:20:42.080 --> 02:20:44.950 align:start position:0%
demolition debris
um

02:20:44.950 --> 02:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
i had signed up in support of the bill
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
and not intended to speak but um having
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
listened to some of the questions and
 
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
the conversation i just would like to
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
offer a couple of points i mean you
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to speak if you if you want
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
to just listen it's okay yeah no i know
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
um however um
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
i think a key part of this bill which i
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
do support is that it is local and it's
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
opting in by local municipalities and i
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
think that that is the scale at which we
 
02:21:12.389 --> 02:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
need to be working right now
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i am concerned about the issue raised
 
02:21:16.469 --> 02:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
with claremont
 
02:21:18.469 --> 02:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
the the only city in sullivan county in
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
a city i've been
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
much involved with in solid waste issues
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
over many many years
 
02:21:24.399 --> 02:21:25.349 align:start position:0%
over many many years
the

02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
the large-scale proposal for moving
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
up to five 500 to 800 tons per day out
 
02:21:33.670 --> 02:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
of claremont towards ohio on rail cars
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
is exactly the wrong direction
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh the state of new hampshire needs to
 
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
be going
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
there was an application filed with des
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
for that proposal which was uh never
 
02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:44.630 align:start position:0%
for that proposal which was uh never
approved

02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
as has now been deemed denied
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
administratively but they are back in
 
02:21:52.309 --> 02:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
claremont currently seeking um
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
seeking a variance uh to allow this this
 
02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
seeking a variance uh to allow this this
use

02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh so so the city remains very concerned
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh this bill would fit
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh as it's written now claremont's needs
 
02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
at the local level any municipality i
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
think would find this a step in the
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
right direction
 
02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
my other concern is with pyrolysis
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
and that's something that came up
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
2019 a bill was passed
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
out of scitec approved by the house and
 
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
out of scitec approved by the house and
senate

02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
which allowed rulemaking
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
which would support pyrolysis in the
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and set some
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
standards permissible levels of lead
 
02:22:36.399 --> 02:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
standards permissible levels of lead
emissions

02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh pyrolysis
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
basically is combustion without oxygen
 
02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
so you do have emissions
 
02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
so you do have emissions
um

02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
acceptable levels of lead
 
02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:51.670 align:start position:0%
acceptable levels of lead
in

02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:22:53.349 --> 02:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
non-waste fuels derived from
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
were in my view excessively high this is
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
creating a new exposure pathway for for
 
02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.389 align:start position:0%
creating a new exposure pathway for for
lead

02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
lead
 
02:23:02.399 --> 02:23:03.750 align:start position:0%
lead
and

02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
so i am concerned again about this the
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
industrial scale
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh and what is actually happening in the
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
marketplace so far nobody has invested
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
in a major pyrolysis plant
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
but back back then there was a proposal
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
being floated
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
before legislative committees for up to
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
a 400 ton per day pyrolysis association
 
02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
a 400 ton per day pyrolysis association
a

02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:23:27.429 --> 02:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis operation associated
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
with a major c d processor down in
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
epping new hampshire
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
so those are the two points that sort of
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
came up for me during the uh the
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
questions and the discussion well thank
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
you for having the courage to step
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
forward and i express you to the
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee are there any questions from
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representatives davis
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
and and thank you also for bringing up
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
the claremont
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh issue i think
 
02:23:54.319 --> 02:23:56.070 align:start position:0%
uh issue i think
any

02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:23:58.309 --> 02:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire that lives
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
adjacent to or anywhere near a freight
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
rail line
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
has to be concerned
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
about massive transport of construction
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
debris which is a growing market
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
and its effect on that municipality in
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
that region and it's for that reason
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
that i would like to
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
explore and ask you if you think an
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill would be
 
02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:25.429 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill would be
beneficial

02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
railroads fall under federal laws and
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
basically can do what they want but we
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to help them
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
by having a state law
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
that supports what they would like to do
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm so my question is do you think it
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
would benefit from an amendment that
 
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
made it very specific that
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure about the wording but
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
the massive rail transport of
 
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
construction debris
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
masquerading as
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
sales in a transfer facility is not
 
02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.630 align:start position:0%
sales in a transfer facility is not
allowed

02:24:56.630 --> 02:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you for your question i i
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
while the existing language
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
as i read it uh would not present an
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
enormous risk i think clarifying
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
language would probably be a good idea
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
because we have seen this before in
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
public-private partnerships where
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
private corporations use municipalities
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
and this happened in claremont in fact
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
going back into the 80s
 
02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
where hundreds of millions of dollars
 
02:25:25.270 --> 02:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
came out of our region and out of our
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
county and our sister county in vermont
 
02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:28.870 align:start position:0%
county and our sister county in vermont
um

02:25:28.870 --> 02:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
a great detriment to economic
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
development in our county and
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
particularly to the city of claremont so
 
02:25:37.030 --> 02:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes i think anything that can be done to
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
make sure this is focused on the local
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
on the municipality
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
and is not simply
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
supporting a very major market new
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a major importer of
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris and
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the disposal bin of last
 
02:25:53.670 --> 02:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
resort it's where you put something when
 
02:25:55.990 --> 02:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
you don't know where else to put it
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
lebanon new hampshire is a model right
 
02:25:59.190 --> 02:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
now about how to
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
how to address this particular waste
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
stream they're doing very good work
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
and they're doing i think what what this
 
02:26:08.550 --> 02:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill 1122 is trying to begin at least a
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
discussion about which is you've got to
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
be doing source segregation and you've
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
got to be doing it as soon as possible
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
preferably at the
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
the construction site the renovation
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
site or the demolition site right now
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's just coming at us in mixed loads
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
you don't know what's in it it's very
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
problematic but anyway yes i would i
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
would certainly support an amendment
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
that made it very clear this is local
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
municipal and it's for the public sector
 
02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
not the private sector
 
02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:37.190 align:start position:0%
not the private sector
representative

02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i don't know i
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
i was the one who brought up the
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis and i'm very closely involved
 
02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
with the pyrolysis
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
technology that the latest one that is
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
plasmagen pyrolysis which is the
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
emission is almost net zero and it's
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
aggregated and it also provides and
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis ranges from to the difference
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
between right so the
 
02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh regular incineration versus pyrolysis
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
ranges 10 times
 
02:27:13.280 --> 02:27:14.150 align:start position:0%
ranges 10 times
more

02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
hotter and no oxygen so from that point
 
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
of view
 
02:27:21.270 --> 02:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
looking at pyrolysis where it converts
 
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
the waste
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
totally into energy
 
02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:26.710 align:start position:0%
totally into energy
and

02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
any byproduct
 
02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:30.710 align:start position:0%
any byproduct
completely

02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
um environmentally friendly no
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
no um
 
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:36.550 align:start position:0%
no um
toxic

02:27:36.550 --> 02:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
toxic
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
emission or leeching
 
02:27:41.910 --> 02:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
have you heard of that or are you aware
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
of this yes i'm very aware of the
 
02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
technology and of the progress that has
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
been made pyrolysis has been around for
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
over a century the old gas tank down at
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
the end of south main street was
 
02:27:52.950 --> 02:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
basically a pyrolysis operation very
 
02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
basically a pyrolysis operation very
dirty

02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
dirty
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
it is much cleaner today you are correct
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
but when you're dealing with elements
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
like lead you cannot destroy them you're
 
02:28:01.590 --> 02:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
simply moving them from one place to
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
another or one medium to another
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
and that i think is where the problem
 
02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:06.150 align:start position:0%
and that i think is where the problem
comes

02:28:06.150 --> 02:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
comes
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
because you are generating energy with
 
02:28:10.150 --> 02:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
pyrolysis plants
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously the potential for
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
profit there
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
my problem really in new hampshire is
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
the standard we set
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
for permissible exposures
 
02:28:21.190 --> 02:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:28:24.950 --> 02:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you sir i appreciate you stepping
 
02:28:28.070 --> 02:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
up and entering the discussion thank you
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace for the
 
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association i
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
will be as brief as possible we support
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
as the committee comments have indicated
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
the committee is well aware of
 
02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
the issue with solid waste we have in
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
this state i think representative van
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
summarized the
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill would accomplish very
 
02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:57.270 align:start position:0%
what this bill would accomplish very
nicely

02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
nicely
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i would just re-emphasize that this
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
is a local option that does have the
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
potential to reduce some solid waste
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
raise some funds for municipalities and
 
02:29:11.349 --> 02:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
potentially provide some resources
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
for new construction projects through
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
reuse of old ones i'm happy to answer
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
any questions anyone have you have
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
any expertise
 
02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:21.429 align:start position:0%
any expertise
or

02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:29:21.439 --> 02:29:22.550 align:start position:0%
or
history

02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
of dealing with the questions that have
 
02:29:26.870 --> 02:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
come up with pyrolysis and or
 
02:29:28.870 --> 02:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
waste products from this type of
 
02:29:31.910 --> 02:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
activity i do not but i do know the
 
02:29:34.230 --> 02:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
solid waste manager in lebanon new
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i'm happy to have direct
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
any committee questions to him yeah well
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
what i was thinking is representative
 
02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
egan is going to bring us an amendment
 
02:29:45.590 --> 02:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
this warrants
 
02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:49.030 align:start position:0%
this warrants
expanding

02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
the topic of that amendment to include
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
secondary waste issues that seem to have
 
02:29:57.190 --> 02:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
come up
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
i just don't know if you're willing to
 
02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
maybe work with representative egan or
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay we i will be in contact
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
with him today and put him in touch with
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh everyone i know in the waste
 
02:30:11.349 --> 02:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
management world and i'm sure they'll
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
come up with a good solution i suspect
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
this bill will have trouble
 
02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
at the at its next step if we don't
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
answer those questions
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes um i would be happy to work
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
with uh nsma or representative egan
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of the pyrolysis
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
i've done a lot of work with that so i
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy yes
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
you're already doing that
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead so representative stavis
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
is already doing that and representative
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
manchipudi is volunteering to work with
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
you as well excellent i will send an
 
02:30:42.399 --> 02:30:43.349 align:start position:0%
you as well excellent i will send an
email

02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
email
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much thank you okay
 
02:30:48.630 --> 02:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
that concludes the hearing
 
02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
and we are now going to open the next
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:30:59.510 --> 02:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1155
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
which is relative to persons elected to
 
02:31:03.429 --> 02:31:03.439 align:start position:0%
a local school board
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
rather a local board serving on another
 
02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:09.030 align:start position:0%
rather a local board serving on another
board

02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
mr would you like to
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
introduce to bill
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
i would good morning and thank you mr
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the municipal
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
county and government committee
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is peter teroshan
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
i'm a state representative representing
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
rockingham county district 14 which is
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
the towns of atkinson and plaistow
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
and before you this morning is the prime
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor of house bill 1155
 
02:31:40.550 --> 02:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
an act relative to persons elected to a
 
02:31:43.349 --> 02:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
local board serving on another board
 
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
the intent of this legislation is to
 
02:31:48.309 --> 02:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
have the ex-officio member
 
02:31:48.319 --> 02:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
have the ex-officio member
so

02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:50.950 --> 02:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
the ex-official member is somebody
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
that's appointed from the governing
 
02:31:53.190 --> 02:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
board whether it be the board of
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
selectmen or
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
town council whatever it may be called
 
02:31:59.349 --> 02:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
in the municipality
 
02:32:01.510 --> 02:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh who's appointed to
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
be liaison to another
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee in that town for example a
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
budget committee planning board building
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
needs committee what have you
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
it would continue to keep that
 
02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
ex officio
 
02:32:18.230 --> 02:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
as a member but it would be a non-voting
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
member that's in essence what the
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislation does
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the reason for this is quite simple
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
is to maintain a balance of power
 
02:32:26.389 --> 02:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
between the governing board and the
 
02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
other boards
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
for example an ex-official member of a
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
town's budget committee
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
can currently vote on town budgets
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
in warrants with the board of selectmen
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
and then he can go over the next
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
official on the budget committee side
 
02:32:43.270 --> 02:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
and vote for the the same
 
02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:44.309 align:start position:0%
and vote for the the same
budget

02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
and warrants essentially getting a
 
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
second bite of the apple or second vote
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
so it gives that individual kind of a
 
02:32:52.710 --> 02:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
super majority
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
i believe government works best
 
02:32:55.359 --> 02:32:56.309 align:start position:0%
i believe government works best
when

02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
when
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's a balance between the
 
02:32:57.760 --> 02:32:58.950 align:start position:0%
uh there's a balance between the
branches

02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
branches
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
of government with full transparency
 
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
many of my constituents aren't aware
 
02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:04.950 align:start position:0%
many of my constituents aren't aware
that

02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:08.070 --> 02:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
in my town that the next official
 
02:33:11.030 --> 02:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
can vote and and i've been questioned by
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why there's a an
 
02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:14.150 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why there's a an
extra

02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
extra
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
member of the committee that's voting i
 
02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't remember voting for him
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know for the planning board or
 
02:33:22.630 --> 02:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
the budget committee whatever it was
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
and i explained what well
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
he didn't run for that committee he's
 
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
he's a member of the board of select
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
when they get a
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
in some instances the liaison
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
that i've seen
 
02:33:44.309 --> 02:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
in our town and towns around me
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
has not participated with their
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee for example
 
02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're appointed by the board of
 
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
selectmen to be
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
liaison to their budget committee
 
02:33:54.319 --> 02:33:55.270 align:start position:0%
liaison to their budget committee
they

02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't participate at all in the process
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
so they they lose out on the debate
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
really the the work that the budget
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee come that does and then they
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
show up on
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
the public hearing day and vote
 
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
without being fully informed and
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
i know a particular member that did that
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
and while they were doing that they were
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
texting on the phone the whole time they
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
had their marching orders of how to vote
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what they did and i'm not
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
saying everybody does that but again
 
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
this is a balance of power issue
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that the person is voting
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
we certainly want the people that are
 
02:34:36.399 --> 02:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
we certainly want the people that are
voting

02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
to be fully engaged in the process
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
and if you're
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
an elected member of that committee and
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
you're not engaged and you're not
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
paying attention the details the voters
 
02:34:51.270 --> 02:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
have a right to
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
decide to vote somebody else into that
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
position in the next election
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
so let me be clear there is a value to
 
02:34:59.590 --> 02:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
have an ex official member to provide
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
useful information dialogue for issues
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
of concern that help work out
 
02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
and again just to reiterate um
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
again i think it's useful to have an ex
 
02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:15.590 align:start position:0%
again i think it's useful to have an ex
officio

02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
officio
 
02:35:18.710 --> 02:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
um but to have one that doesn't attend
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
meetings and then just shows up to be a
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
robo vote
 
02:35:21.439 --> 02:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
robo vote
um

02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
to to get a second bite of the apple i
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
think is bad policy bad government
 
02:35:30.790 --> 02:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
there's a further concern
 
02:35:33.750 --> 02:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
um with the current rsa when you run for
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
office so at the local level if you
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
decide you want to run for your board of
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
selectmen you can't put your name on the
 
02:35:40.389 --> 02:35:40.399 align:start position:0%
ballot say i'm going to run for the
 
02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen in the budget
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee or i'm going to run for the
 
02:35:45.270 --> 02:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
border selectmen and and planning board
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
that's not allowed because there's a
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
is a simple reason for that
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
there could be
 
02:35:52.790 --> 02:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
between you know to be running for two
 
02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
boards holding two boards on the local
 
02:35:59.590 --> 02:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh level obviously you can run
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
and be elected to a a local committee in
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
your town and run and be elected to a
 
02:36:08.710 --> 02:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
position up here at the state house
 
02:36:10.469 --> 02:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
keeping that in mind that you can't run
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
for two boards
 
02:36:17.030 --> 02:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
and following the same logic
 
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
the ex-official member should not have a
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
vote on the second committee
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
i ask you to please to consider an otp
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1155
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
this concludes my testimony i'd be happy
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
to take any questions that the committee
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
may have
 
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand something
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
that would apply to where i live which
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
is a city which is lebanon
 
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
where i serve on the planning board
 
02:36:49.750 --> 02:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
which is an appointed not an elected
 
02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:50.870 align:start position:0%
which is an appointed not an elected
position

02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
and we have a representative from the
 
02:36:55.830 --> 02:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
city council who is elect an elected
 
02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
city council who is elect an elected
official

02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
official
 
02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
as a liaison
 
02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
from the city council to the planning
 
02:37:02.469 --> 02:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
board and
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
that person is a voting member
 
02:37:08.550 --> 02:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
with if this bill should pass would that
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
no longer be allowed i mean
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
that person's vote is critical to our
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
planning purposes
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative so um
 
02:37:20.950 --> 02:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i guess one of the questions i would
 
02:37:23.349 --> 02:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
have um i know we can go back and forth
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
but if if and i don't know how your town
 
02:37:27.750 --> 02:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh points does does your gut does your
 
02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
governing board appoint city council
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
appoints okay
 
02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:32.950 align:start position:0%
appoints okay
so

02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
the same rule would apply the the
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
liaison member um wouldn't get a vote
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
but the planning board members
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't matter if you're an
 
02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:47.270 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't matter if you're an
elected

02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
in an elected position or an appointed
 
02:37:51.110 --> 02:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
position in that second committee in
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
this case the planning board
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
all those members would continue to vote
 
02:37:56.950 --> 02:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
they were they were appointed for that
 
02:37:59.510 --> 02:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
purpose the ex-official
 
02:38:02.389 --> 02:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
can participate in all matters regarding
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
planning board and be again a go-to
 
02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:05.750 align:start position:0%
planning board and be again a go-to
between

02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
your town council city council
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions they may have so
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
02:38:12.710 --> 02:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
good communication back and forth but at
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um only the
 
02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:17.590 align:start position:0%
the end of the day um only the
the

02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
appointed or elected positions of that
 
02:38:20.950 --> 02:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
particular board would have a vote
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:26.469 --> 02:38:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative again
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
then in line six of your bill
 
02:38:31.429 --> 02:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
should it not say
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
to which the person was not elected or
 
02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
to which the person was not elected or
appointed

02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:38.630 --> 02:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
what the intent is there and and i heard
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
that there was maybe some confusion on
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
that and i'd certainly be open to to an
 
02:38:42.160 --> 02:38:43.429 align:start position:0%
that and i'd certainly be open to to an
amendment

02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
it it means that the um
 
02:38:49.270 --> 02:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
appointed so in other words
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
how the words intended to be used in
 
02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
this languages
 
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
if the governing board
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
appoints the person to another board
 
02:39:00.389 --> 02:39:00.399 align:start position:0%
then it's a non-voting position if your
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
governing board appoints
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
the planning board they certainly would
 
02:39:05.830 --> 02:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:07.590 align:start position:0%
have a
voting

02:39:07.590 --> 02:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
position so
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
if that needs an amendment to clarify
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
that i'd be happy to uh
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
it certainly would make it clearer for
 
02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
me although i continue to say that the
 
02:39:21.750 --> 02:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
the vote of the city council member on
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
our planning board is absolutely crucial
 
02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:25.110 align:start position:0%
our planning board is absolutely crucial
but

02:39:25.110 --> 02:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
needless to say
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of that
 
02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
regardless of that
i

02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
i find the language a little bit
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
confusing because it does
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
say elected
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
and in at least in our case
 
02:39:39.830 --> 02:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have elected officials on our
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
right i understand and the reason i used
 
02:39:43.359 --> 02:39:43.990 align:start position:0%
right i understand and the reason i used
the

02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
word appointed was to because
 
02:39:48.790 --> 02:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a couple different
 
02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
terms that could be used the person
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
could be appointed by the board of
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
selection of the committee they could be
 
02:39:57.030 --> 02:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
their next official member um so
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
again just to clarify
 
02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:00.389 align:start position:0%
again just to clarify
um

02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't take away the right of a
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
person that was appointed to do that
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
board's business to vote
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
and for that matter if there was a
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
vacancy in a board an elected board
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
where that particular board say the
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
planning board's elected they have
 
02:40:14.309 --> 02:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
somebody move out of town there's a
 
02:40:14.319 --> 02:40:15.429 align:start position:0%
somebody move out of town there's a
vacancy

02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:16.309 align:start position:0%
vacancy
um

02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
in that in most towns that
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
committee committee's allowed to pick
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
their replacement that person would be
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
appointed and they certainly would have
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
the right to vote so that's
 
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh in my town i'm elected to the select
 
02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:44.790 align:start position:0%
uh in my town i'm elected to the select
board

02:40:44.790 --> 02:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh from there i am the ex officio by
 
02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
statute or or as statute allows to the
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
planning board our seven-member member
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
from that planning board i sit on a
 
02:40:58.309 --> 02:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
three-member subcommittee three-member
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
because if we had four obviously we'd
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
have a quorum of the planning board and
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that on a
 
02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.389 align:start position:0%
we don't want to do that on a
subcommittee

02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass would i have a
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:41:14.309 --> 02:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
how is this i guess i want to know how
 
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is is um
 
02:41:20.790 --> 02:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
put together you know what's the process
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
there if if it was an elected
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
position or appointed for just for the
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
exclusive purpose of being on the
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee i would say
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
a liaison if you were considered the
 
02:41:34.230 --> 02:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
next official would not get a vote it
 
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
would be the same would apply but i
 
02:41:42.389 --> 02:41:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:41:45.920 --> 02:41:47.110 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are different uh descriptions of
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh land use boards and how they are
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
the makeup of different land use boards
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
and planning boards um
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a six-member board plus an
 
02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:03.349 align:start position:0%
have a six-member board plus an
ex-officio

02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
ex-officio
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh governing body member
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
if the governing body body member
 
02:42:09.349 --> 02:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't vote then then you'd have an
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
even number in your cases and could
 
02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
easily have nothing pass
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
and then the other land use boards like
 
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
the historic district commission and the
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
heritage commission
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
specifically say
 
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
that a member of the governing body may
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
be a member of that board but it doesn't
 
02:42:28.469 --> 02:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
say anything about non-voting
 
02:42:31.510 --> 02:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's just for the um
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
during the period of my term
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't remember all the other land
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
use boards but they all reference
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh somebody being a
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
governing body
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
member being appointed to the
 
02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
to those boards so would this now
 
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
say that none of those people can act on
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
any of those
 
02:42:55.110 --> 02:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
land use boards and therefore
 
02:42:55.120 --> 02:42:56.230 align:start position:0%
land use boards and therefore
um

02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
leave different boards with an even
 
02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:01.269 align:start position:0%
number of
votes

02:43:01.269 --> 02:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:43:02.389 --> 02:43:02.399 align:start position:0%
i thank you representative for the
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
question in in
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
so the answer is this again if we adopt
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
this language it would change
 
02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:09.910 align:start position:0%
this language it would change
the

02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
ex official from the governing body in
 
02:43:12.950 --> 02:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
your town
 
02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
to have a vote but other members that
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
are appointed to that land use board
 
02:43:18.710 --> 02:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
would get a vote in regard to the even
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
versus odd number
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
i've been on boards that are even
 
02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
numbers i think in some respects
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
it makes us work a little harder which
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily a bad thing because
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
i've been there when we
 
02:43:32.870 --> 02:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
we end up splitting the vote and we go
 
02:43:33.450 --> 02:43:33.460 align:start position:0%
back to
 
02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:34.870 align:start position:0%
back to
[Music]

02:43:34.870 --> 02:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:43:37.269 --> 02:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
work out our differences and and pass
 
02:43:38.550 --> 02:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
whatever we're trying to pass out of
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
that committee so i understand where
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
you're coming from it's i guess it's the
 
02:43:43.830 --> 02:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
same could be said if the governing
 
02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
same could be said if the governing
board

02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
is an odd number or any other board and
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
one person doesn't show up that night
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
you have an even number you're in the
 
02:43:54.469 --> 02:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
all of these boards are described as how
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
many members you can have
 
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
seven or five three three alternates
 
02:44:04.309 --> 02:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
four alternates depending on the board
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
so you have to have seven members of a
 
02:44:09.269 --> 02:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
and one of them is
 
02:44:11.120 --> 02:44:11.910 align:start position:0%
and one of them is
a

02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
member of the governing body so
 
02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
this is this not in direct conflict with
 
02:44:16.720 --> 02:44:17.670 align:start position:0%
this is this not in direct conflict with
the

02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
previous rsa and or should you be
 
02:44:24.389 --> 02:44:24.399 align:start position:0%
amending different rsas to get the
 
02:44:24.399 --> 02:44:25.750 align:start position:0%
amending different rsas to get the
the

02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:44:28.150 --> 02:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
outcome that you're looking for
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
thanks again for the follow-up question
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
well i would suggest the governing board
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
again if that's the
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
board that appoints people could appoint
 
02:44:37.910 --> 02:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
a seventh person there's nothing in this
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that would prevent them from
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
having an odd number so in that case if
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
you had seven
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
so you met that requirement the ex
 
02:44:46.389 --> 02:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
official would be the eighth
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
but being an advisory only that wouldn't
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:54.790 --> 02:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
let me say uh
 
02:44:58.590 --> 02:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative would you agree that
 
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
the odd number of votes
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
while not
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
required it's probably advised so you
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
know so that the
 
02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:09.670 align:start position:0%
know so that the
the

02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:11.910 --> 02:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
the committee or the or the subcommittee
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't run into thai votes which
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
which stops
 
02:45:20.550 --> 02:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
any uh any suggestion for moving forward
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be a better
 
02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:23.429 align:start position:0%
certainly that would be a better
scenario

02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to pass something out
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
you you could stalemate with an even
 
02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
number but again as as a follow-up to
 
02:45:33.190 --> 02:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
what i just said um this legislation
 
02:45:34.469 --> 02:45:34.479 align:start position:0%
won't prevent
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
the governing board from
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
from changing that to make sure they
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chu thank you
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm not asking about um
 
02:45:52.230 --> 02:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
any of the rsa
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
what prompted you to come up with this
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
is there a issue that uh you're trying
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
to address or to me it seems more like a
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
micromanaging individual local boards or
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
local appointees
 
02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
correct or wrong thank you for the um
 
02:46:12.389 --> 02:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
no it's actually not trying to
 
02:46:15.590 --> 02:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
micromanage as i mentioned in my
 
02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
testimony i've had constituents approach
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
me on that wondering why there was a
 
02:46:21.190 --> 02:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
person that shows up every now and then
 
02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
gets to vote that wasn't elected to the
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
board so this is actually not
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
micromanaging this is actually
 
02:46:30.550 --> 02:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
trying to uh ensure that
 
02:46:34.309 --> 02:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
the boards have um the power to do their
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
the job they were elected to
 
02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:37.830 align:start position:0%
the job they were elected to
without

02:46:37.830 --> 02:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:46:40.150 --> 02:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know again in essence under the
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
current situation i use budget because
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
in an sb2 town budget committees uh pass
 
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
a budget in the board of select runner
 
02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:49.349 align:start position:0%
a budget in the board of select runner
um

02:46:49.349 --> 02:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
town council um
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
to think of it another way
 
02:47:00.870 --> 02:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
um this this
 
02:47:02.309 --> 02:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
on the local level is kind of like if
 
02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
some one of the members of the other
 
02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:04.710 align:start position:0%
some one of the members of the other
body

02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
um here at the state level got a vote
 
02:47:10.309 --> 02:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
with us in the house and vice versa so
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
this this is actually to to clarify in
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
clarity to the
 
02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
fact that as an as a citizen when you
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
vote for somebody on a board they do
 
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
that job without
 
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
giving somebody on another board a
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
second or third bite of the apple
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
depending if they're late lays on a x
 
02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
official to more than one committee that
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:47:40.150 --> 02:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
just thank you for taking a follow-up
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's almost
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
seems to me to look at i mean each
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
community has its own appointed or
 
02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:50.790 align:start position:0%
community has its own appointed or
elected

02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
and uh processes uh
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere balanced so are we
 
02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
looking at bringing the partisanship in
 
02:47:58.640 --> 02:48:01.190 align:start position:0%
looking at bringing the partisanship in
that

02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
whole democratic
 
02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
process of stalemate down to the local
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
level that's that's
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
why i am perceiving this so correct me
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
no thank you representative no that's
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
not the intent again the intent is to to
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
balance the power so that the um
 
02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
the committees involved have
 
02:48:23.349 --> 02:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know the full authority they were
 
02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
voted into office to
 
02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:27.429 align:start position:0%
voted into office to
exercise

02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
02:48:27.439 --> 02:48:28.469 align:start position:0%
exercise
um

02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
without having one
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee or board having more power
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
which is in essence what the current rsa
 
02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
which is in essence what the current rsa
allows

02:48:37.830 --> 02:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and i have a quick
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
question and then uh
 
02:48:46.309 --> 02:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a follow-up to it um is this
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
applied to all municipalities meaning
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
town city village exactly
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
or is it just two towns
 
02:48:54.389 --> 02:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
to and i i can't tell you exactly how
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
each uh municipalities is structured but
 
02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
the irsa that this pertains to any town
 
02:49:02.479 --> 02:49:04.710 align:start position:0%
the irsa that this pertains to any town
that

02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
falls under that rsa this would would
 
02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:08.230 align:start position:0%
falls under that rsa this would would
affect

02:49:08.230 --> 02:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
affect
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
may i have thank you um
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
in in in my city
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
um i am we we have a board of aldermen
 
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
elected we have a board of education
 
02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
elected we have a board of education
elected

02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have um a liaison from the board of
 
02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
aldermen on the board of ed they're
 
02:49:29.349 --> 02:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
non-voting they're just advisory
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
i am a board of alderman member i'm on
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
other committees that are appointed
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
some i'm just liaison to give advice
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
and to help guide them and others i'm
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
actually a voting member
 
02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:44.389 align:start position:0%
actually a voting member
and

02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
they choose that for a particular reason
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
are you saying that you feel
 
02:49:49.359 --> 02:49:50.469 align:start position:0%
are you saying that you feel
that

02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
i would have an undue influence on that
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying me particularly i'm
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
just saying the position so um would
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
have an undue influence on the one that
 
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
i do get to to vote on
 
02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
um when it was made up they looked at
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
all who the stakeholders were and they
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
wanted all the stakeholders on that
 
02:50:09.670 --> 02:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
particular committee
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
so that's i guess my question to you uh
 
02:50:14.309 --> 02:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
thanks again for the follow-up question
 
02:50:14.319 --> 02:50:16.150 align:start position:0%
thanks again for the follow-up question
um

02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
i guess the simple answer is
 
02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:19.670 align:start position:0%
i guess the simple answer is
the

02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:50:22.150 --> 02:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this language it will um you
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's several that you're
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's a non-voting so this this is what
 
02:50:28.550 --> 02:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
that attempts to do you want that we we
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
want in in
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
indeed i believe it is good to have that
 
02:50:33.590 --> 02:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
liaison and that relationship between
 
02:50:35.349 --> 02:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
the voice communication is important in
 
02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
any municipality
 
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
um but it's again it's balancing off
 
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in this
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:50:45.590 --> 02:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislation prevents the governing board
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
again if they appoint a position to add
 
02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
other members to that board they can
 
02:50:52.469 --> 02:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
still do that may have a follow up
 
02:50:52.479 --> 02:50:53.429 align:start position:0%
still do that may have a follow up
um

02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
i i should have clarified and i
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
apologize for not doing it
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
so for instance the
 
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
one of the um commissions that i'm on
 
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
as a liaison and a voting member
 
02:51:06.469 --> 02:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
does not bring anything back to the
 
02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
so when that commission was created they
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
wanted all stakeholders so a board of
 
02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
aldermen citizens
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
different organizations someone maybe
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
from construction and so on it's
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't go back to the
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen but if i read this
 
02:51:23.359 --> 02:51:24.950 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen but if i read this
correctly

02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
even though i'm a stakeholder in that
 
02:51:28.389 --> 02:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
and the information is not going back to
 
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
the board of aldermen for a final
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
decision so therefore i'm not getting
 
02:51:33.990 --> 02:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
two bites of the apple i would not be
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
able to vote on it though so the board
 
02:51:38.550 --> 02:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
of aldermen's stake in this or the city
 
02:51:40.870 --> 02:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
stake in this would not
 
02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:42.070 align:start position:0%
stake in this would not
um

02:51:42.070 --> 02:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:43.590 --> 02:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
be represented
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay thanks again for the further
 
02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:46.469 align:start position:0%
okay thanks again for the further
follow-up

02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:51:46.479 --> 02:51:47.349 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

02:51:47.349 --> 02:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
well you you still have the vote with
 
02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
the border element and so in the
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
scenario that i painted with the budget
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee versus a border selectmen
 
02:51:57.670 --> 02:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that person still like the other members
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the border selectmen vote on the
 
02:52:00.550 --> 02:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
budget in that
 
02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:01.590 align:start position:0%
budget in that
committee

02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:52:02.710 --> 02:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
or board
 
02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
um and the the budget committee votes
 
02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
their their uh budget and then in most
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities what happens is there's
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
some reconciliation between the two two
 
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
boards to work out the differences they
 
02:52:18.309 --> 02:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
have so um
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
again i i think it it makes more
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
transparency and better government
 
02:52:24.309 --> 02:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
because again i
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
02:52:27.190 --> 02:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
when citizens don't know that there's
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
somebody on the board that they didn't
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
elect they they question their have
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
questioned me and that again the reason
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think i'm just not making
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
myself clear so
 
02:52:40.469 --> 02:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
maybe if i give the the perfect example
 
02:52:42.309 --> 02:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
of it is i'm on the board of aldermen
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
i'm also on the historic district
 
02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:45.269 align:start position:0%
i'm also on the historic district
commission

02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
the historic district commission was
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
created by the board of aldermen
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
it does not report back to the board of
 
02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:52.150 align:start position:0%
it does not report back to the board of
aldermen

02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
aldermen
 
02:52:54.710 --> 02:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
they just wanted to have a voice on that
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
commission as well as all the other
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders which are mostly citizens
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
on on that particular
 
02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:03.030 align:start position:0%
on on that particular
commission

02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:53:05.590 --> 02:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
if i read this correctly i would not be
 
02:53:07.429 --> 02:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
able to be a voting member on that
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
historic district
 
02:53:09.200 --> 02:53:10.710 align:start position:0%
historic district
commission

02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
even though
 
02:53:14.070 --> 02:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
nothing that they do comes back to the
 
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
board of aldermen
 
02:53:18.309 --> 02:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
does that does that clarify a little bit
 
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not like i'm on the board of ed
 
02:53:24.389 --> 02:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
and where that may come to whatever the
 
02:53:26.950 --> 02:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
selectmen or the governing body
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
no you're clear on that and in your
 
02:53:31.269 --> 02:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
assumption is correct um
 
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
with that and you know i understand this
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
is not with the one you just
 
02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
the example you gave is not one that
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
would lend itself to conflict some of
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
the others i mentioned it is the
 
02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
conflict is is part of the reason again
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me just so this does
 
02:53:51.510 --> 02:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
take that into this um would stop me
 
02:53:52.710 --> 02:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
from voting is what i'm trying to say
 
02:53:52.720 --> 02:53:53.510 align:start position:0%
from voting is what i'm trying to say
yes

02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much
 
02:53:56.640 --> 02:53:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much
representative

02:53:58.070 --> 02:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:59.510 --> 02:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
taking yet another question
 
02:54:05.510 --> 02:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask you the question
 
02:54:07.110 --> 02:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
clee just asked about the bite of the
 
02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:08.070 align:start position:0%
clee just asked about the bite of the
apple

02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
apple
 
02:54:11.190 --> 02:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'll try it in a different way which is
 
02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:12.309 align:start position:0%
i'll try it in a different way which is
um

02:54:12.309 --> 02:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the lebanon planning board
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
the city council representative who has
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
a vote on the planning board which is
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
appointed by the city council
 
02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
and is listed as part of the duties of
 
02:54:31.269 --> 02:54:31.279 align:start position:0%
city councilors to serve on planning
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
board as liaisons
 
02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
that information never goes back to the
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
city council for any kind of vote
 
02:54:39.359 --> 02:54:40.710 align:start position:0%
city council for any kind of vote
whatsoever

02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
so the the supposition that there is
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
undue influence
 
02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:46.710 align:start position:0%
undue influence
or

02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:54:49.990 --> 02:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
more than one bite of the apple
 
02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
at least in this case
 
02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
just is not true
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
and this and yet this bill would deprive
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
us of
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
the the necessary voice that we
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely need on the planning board
 
02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
and it is called for in our city charter
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that this bill would
 
02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:11.349 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that this bill would
would

02:55:11.349 --> 02:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
contradict many existing municipal
 
02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:16.550 align:start position:0%
contradict many existing municipal
ordinances

02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
and rules for appointing or electing
 
02:55:22.870 --> 02:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
officials to boards and and i also just
 
02:55:25.190 --> 02:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you about
 
02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
something that you
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
said about
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
in response to a question about what
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
prompted you to put forward this
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and you said it was i i
 
02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
believe you said it was a question from
 
02:55:37.990 --> 02:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
a constituent
 
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
who asked hey what's up with this person
 
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
who gets a vote on this board and i
 
02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
didn't elect them
 
02:55:46.790 --> 02:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't the response to that question
 
02:55:49.429 --> 02:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
had been well actually that person
 
02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't elected to that board that's in
 
02:55:55.269 --> 02:55:55.279 align:start position:0%
your town's charter that that person is
 
02:55:57.349 --> 02:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
appointed to that board as a voting
 
02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
member and that's
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
an appropriate position
 
02:56:02.790 --> 02:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
what what is the supposition that there
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
is hanky-panky going on i just don't get
 
02:56:05.439 --> 02:56:06.950 align:start position:0%
is hanky-panky going on i just don't get
that

02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and so um
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's what i i said that
 
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
there was hanky-panky going on but it no
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's not in and i did and i did explain
 
02:56:18.070 --> 02:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
to him
 
02:56:18.080 --> 02:56:19.110 align:start position:0%
to him
to

02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:56:20.950 --> 02:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
my constituents that ask
 
02:56:23.110 --> 02:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
how it's set up it's not in the town
 
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
charter it's in the rsa in fact a lot of
 
02:56:28.790 --> 02:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
towns from what i understand don't the
 
02:56:30.870 --> 02:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
um ex official doesn't necessarily
 
02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
exercise that vote to write because they
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
feel it's
 
02:56:36.070 --> 02:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
again the super majority kind of
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
anyway in regard to the one
 
02:56:45.190 --> 02:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
with your planning board um
 
02:56:46.870 --> 02:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
again i would not knowing your charter i
 
02:56:47.990 --> 02:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
really can't answer the question and
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
stuff to what extent this affects that
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
if you read the irsa that it affects
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
and pertains to
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
towns and in uh committees as reference
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the rsa
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay for those who have support or
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um i'm sorry we have a
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
couple more folks to testify
 
02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:17.750 align:start position:0%
couple more folks to testify
um

02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
mr graves from uh
 
02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:22.399 align:start position:0%
from municipal and uh county government
 
02:57:30.070 --> 02:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:31.750 --> 02:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and here's the new
 
02:57:33.990 --> 02:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill after i've heard the
 
02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.550 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill after i've heard the
sponsor

02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
talk about why he wanted the bill i
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
think that the intent is really
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
to modify the membership of at least a
 
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
specific committee
 
02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that this bill does that
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to explain that by using
 
02:57:54.469 --> 02:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
the example of a planning board so
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
planning board is created
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
or i guess i should say a town
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislative body so the town voters have
 
02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
a choice about how they want to compose
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
that planning board and that's under rsa
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
673 colon 2.
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
if you think of a traditional town with
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
a select board um
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
there are two options really either the
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
planning board is elected or appointed
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
and it's comprised of some at-large
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
members and an ex-official member who is
 
02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
a select board member or administrative
 
02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:28.150 align:start position:0%
a select board member or administrative
official

02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
official
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
and that's all contained within 673
 
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
colon 2.
 
02:58:36.469 --> 02:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
now 672 colon 5 defines ex officio and
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's just the common definition it's
 
02:58:40.389 --> 02:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
the common definition used in the law
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
and it it just says you know an
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
ex-official member is just somebody
 
02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:46.469 align:start position:0%
ex-official member is just somebody
who's

02:58:46.469 --> 02:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
who's
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed to one board who
 
02:58:51.429 --> 02:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
then serves as a member on another board
 
02:58:51.439 --> 02:58:52.710 align:start position:0%
then serves as a member on another board
um

02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
in in the particular case of a land use
 
02:58:54.800 --> 02:58:55.830 align:start position:0%
in in the particular case of a land use
board

02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
like we're using the select board member
 
02:59:00.389 --> 02:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
is picked by the other select board
 
02:59:03.030 --> 02:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
members to go serve as that seventh
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
member on the planning board
 
02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
when we look at
 
02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as written
 
02:59:13.670 --> 02:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
presumably that would be the person who
 
02:59:16.630 --> 02:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
qualifies under line four as appointed
 
02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
qualifies under line four as appointed
to

02:59:17.510 --> 02:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
serving on that other municipal board
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
and now we'd have a conflict in the law
 
02:59:25.910 --> 02:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
because rsa 672 colon 5 wouldn't
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
say the same thing as the new 669 colon
 
02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
9 hyphen a
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
now you might also have
 
02:59:36.230 --> 02:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know a official budget committee in
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
your town
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
an official budget committee does not
 
02:59:40.550 --> 02:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
have anyone serve on the planning board
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
but they might be interested in learning
 
02:59:44.150 --> 02:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
what the planning board is doing because
 
02:59:45.429 --> 02:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
you know the planning board might be
 
02:59:47.830 --> 02:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
redoing the master plan for instance so
 
02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
the official budget committee might
 
02:59:52.389 --> 02:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
appoint a liaison to the to the planning
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
board liaison is just
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any official role there's
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
no they don't vote they don't they don't
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
talk to the board they just get
 
03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
told hey you're on the budget committee
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
with us go over there listen to what
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing come back and tell us
 
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
they might be useful in the context of a
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
master plan creation because they can go
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
back to tell the budget committee hey
 
03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
look here's how we think development's
 
03:00:16.150 --> 03:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen in this town
 
03:00:18.150 --> 03:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we should consider allocating some
 
03:00:20.230 --> 03:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
resources in the budget to specific
 
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
projects rather than others
 
03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
projects rather than others
um

03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
and so that would just be a liaison um
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
and that person would have no official
 
03:00:33.429 --> 03:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
role so already in line four and onto
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
five is a liaison to another local board
 
03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
that person already can't vote they
 
03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
can't even participate in the board
 
03:00:40.240 --> 03:00:42.309 align:start position:0%
can't even participate in the board

03:00:42.309 --> 03:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have the third option
 
03:00:47.349 --> 03:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
on line four which is serving on another
 
03:00:47.359 --> 03:00:48.710 align:start position:0%
on line four which is serving on another
board

03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
so if you look at again
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
still looking at the planning board
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
statutes if you look at 673 colon 5
 
03:00:57.429 --> 03:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
it says
 
03:00:59.910 --> 03:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
when may a planning board member serve
 
03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:01.190 align:start position:0%
when may a planning board member serve
on

03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
another board with another planning
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
board member and it's limited so on
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
another land use board only one planning
 
03:01:09.750 --> 03:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
board member may serve but on you know
 
03:01:10.950 --> 03:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
some other
 
03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
board um a planning board member may
 
03:01:16.230 --> 03:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
also serve on that board so
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know you might have a planning board
 
03:01:19.750 --> 03:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
member who's also
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
you know on the historic district
 
03:01:23.190 --> 03:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
commission or something like that
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
that person isn't necessarily appointed
 
03:01:27.590 --> 03:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
there or isn't necessarily uh appointed
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
as an ex-officio to that board or
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
liaison maybe they're just you know
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who was either elected to both
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
of those positions or appointed to both
 
03:01:39.670 --> 03:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
of those positions or some combination
 
03:01:39.680 --> 03:01:41.349 align:start position:0%
of those positions or some combination
thereof

03:01:41.349 --> 03:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
thereof
 
03:01:41.359 --> 03:01:42.469 align:start position:0%
thereof
and

03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:42.479 --> 03:01:43.269 align:start position:0%
and
under

03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:01:47.990 --> 03:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
669 colon 9a this bill is written
 
03:01:49.750 --> 03:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
presumably that person would have to
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
which one of the boards they're serving
 
03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
which one of the boards they're serving
on

03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:01:56.309 --> 03:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
um as kind of the regular voting member
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
and which one they now qualify as a
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
non-voting ex official member and that
 
03:02:00.479 --> 03:02:01.590 align:start position:0%
non-voting ex official member and that
doesn't

03:02:01.590 --> 03:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:02:03.670 --> 03:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
really make a lot of sense
 
03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
really make a lot of sense
um

03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:06.790 --> 03:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's how we would read it that's the
 
03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
advice i would give my members if this
 
03:02:09.670 --> 03:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
were to pass
 
03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
were to pass
um

03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:13.030 --> 03:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think that based on the sponsor's
 
03:02:16.309 --> 03:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
comments the intent was really to modify
 
03:02:16.319 --> 03:02:17.269 align:start position:0%
comments the intent was really to modify
um

03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of membership on some board
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure which one um
 
03:02:24.550 --> 03:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
but i would submit to the committee that
 
03:02:26.309 --> 03:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
an amendment that looked at that
 
03:02:28.070 --> 03:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
specifically might be a better option
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
because it wouldn't interact with all
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
these other statutes inadvertently
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr greece
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um
 
03:02:43.750 --> 03:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
i would ask
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
how would this bill upset the apple cart
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
you did mention some of the other rsas
 
03:02:52.150 --> 03:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's like a domino effect and so there
 
03:02:54.150 --> 03:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
are so many changes
 
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
it you know there's system that's
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
working if one particular
 
03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
instance that it
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
is not changing the whole
 
03:03:04.240 --> 03:03:06.309 align:start position:0%
is not changing the whole
organizational

03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
organizational
 
03:03:08.550 --> 03:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
or whole rsa
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
might upset so many other
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
realistically we have two kinds of
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
boards we have the boards that are
 
03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
statutorily created and their membership
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
is defined in statute um so we can't
 
03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
change those and this may conflict with
 
03:03:27.510 --> 03:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
that and then we have other boards that
 
03:03:30.550 --> 03:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
might be created by an existing board so
 
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
a select board
 
03:03:36.070 --> 03:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
might decide to create a board
 
03:03:37.990 --> 03:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of organizing old home
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
day activities right there's no
 
03:03:39.439 --> 03:03:41.510 align:start position:0%
day activities right there's no
statutory

03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the statutes about
 
03:03:44.950 --> 03:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
that but it's a useful board to have
 
03:03:46.150 --> 03:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
because that board can go out do
 
03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
everything they need to do and report
 
03:03:48.870 --> 03:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
back to the select board about what
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
and how they define the different roles
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
is is is going to be up to that board um
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
and they're going to set the rules for
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
that so they might say hey we want a
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
select board member on there um you know
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
as next official member and then we're
 
03:04:06.309 --> 03:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
going to appoint some people from the
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
community who are interested some you
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
know business people whatever the police
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
chief um
 
03:04:13.030 --> 03:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
and so those are really the two kinds of
 
03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
boards we have and again you're going to
 
03:04:16.550 --> 03:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
run in
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
run into the situation and at least for
 
03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
run into the situation and at least for
the

03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
locally created boards you probably
 
03:04:24.870 --> 03:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
could adjust membership to deal with
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that arise but for
 
03:04:29.429 --> 03:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
the statutorily created ones um
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to resolve the conflict
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:04:37.349 --> 03:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
grace for taking my question so if i
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly and please tell
 
03:04:41.830 --> 03:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
me if i did
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have a resident in our town who has
 
03:04:48.150 --> 03:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
opted to run for the
 
03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
library trustees and has also opted to
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
run for the water commission
 
03:04:54.469 --> 03:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
do i understand that if this bill were
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
to pass or you know this was next year
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
and this would have happened that person
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
would have some
 
03:05:01.429 --> 03:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
would not
 
03:05:03.990 --> 03:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
be clear which position that person
 
03:05:05.429 --> 03:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
could vote
 
03:05:07.110 --> 03:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
you know reading just the relevant
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
language of the bill is written an
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
elected member of a local board
 
03:05:14.950 --> 03:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
commission committee etc
 
03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
who is also serving on
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
another board in the same jurisdiction
 
03:05:21.030 --> 03:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
she'll be a non-voting ex official
 
03:05:23.269 --> 03:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
member of any such local board to which
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
the person was not elected so it's not i
 
03:05:28.389 --> 03:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
mean that doesn't really make
 
03:05:28.399 --> 03:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
mean that doesn't really make
sense

03:05:29.349 --> 03:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:05:29.359 --> 03:05:30.870 align:start position:0%
sense
because

03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:05:32.389 --> 03:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to presume that they're
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
not they're appointed to some board
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're not elected to it um
 
03:05:38.710 --> 03:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm not exactly sure how that would
 
03:05:40.230 --> 03:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
operate but
 
03:05:43.030 --> 03:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
my advice to to my members would be
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
in the possibility that your vote
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't count and we wouldn't know that
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:55.200 --> 03:05:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:05.429 --> 03:06:05.439 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
the boards that are created statutorily
 
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
um could a select board appoint the
 
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
ex-officio to all the boards
 
03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:16.309 align:start position:0%
ex-officio to all the boards
if

03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'll clarify that a little bit
 
03:06:20.550 --> 03:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
say the boards are set up five seven
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
three or whatever odd numbers
 
03:06:25.349 --> 03:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
and then the uh select board will come
 
03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
along and say okay
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are going to appoint ex-officios to
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
those different boards
 
03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:33.990 align:start position:0%
those different boards
now

03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
and they appoint them as a non-voting
 
03:06:40.230 --> 03:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
person just say for example
 
03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
for informational purposes only
 
03:06:45.269 --> 03:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be helpful in that
 
03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
case do you agree
 
03:06:49.510 --> 03:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
i i
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to be clear on terminology
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
here so
 
03:06:56.230 --> 03:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
for example under the budget committee
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
there are multiple options uh for ex
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
officio so each
 
03:07:04.710 --> 03:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
the the select board for example would
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
appoint ex official who just operate as
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
a normal budget committee member but
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
under a board that doesn't have an ex
 
03:07:15.269 --> 03:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
officio specified there would be no
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
ability to appoint an ex-officio they
 
03:07:20.309 --> 03:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
could appoint a liaison which would not
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
be able to participate in discussion
 
03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
unless that other board allowed them to
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
and would not under any circumstance be
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote so you know the
 
03:07:32.710 --> 03:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
select board might appoint an ex
 
03:07:34.230 --> 03:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
official to
 
03:07:34.240 --> 03:07:35.349 align:start position:0%
official to
um

03:07:35.349 --> 03:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
the zba for
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry a liaison to the zba for
 
03:07:39.200 --> 03:07:40.550 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry a liaison to the zba for
instance

03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
instance
 
03:07:42.469 --> 03:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
they would be able to hear what the zba
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
is doing they wouldn't be able to vote
 
03:07:45.590 --> 03:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
they would never be able to participate
 
03:07:47.349 --> 03:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the discussion unless for some reason
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
the zba invited them to do so so that's
 
03:07:52.230 --> 03:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
all statutorily defined and that's why i
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
think a cleaner option if the goal is to
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
do something like change the budget
 
03:07:59.030 --> 03:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee membership would be to look at
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
that statute and change the relevant
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:05.120 --> 03:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
grace for taking my question
 
03:08:16.469 --> 03:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question is around
 
03:08:18.550 --> 03:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and your opinion on that
 
03:08:21.349 --> 03:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you a specific example i
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
chair a
 
03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:24.790 align:start position:0%
chair a
statutory

03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:08:28.070 --> 03:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
commission for the state and
 
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
four of our members of that commission
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
as defined in that statute are appointed
 
03:08:35.429 --> 03:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
by their town council or boards of
 
03:08:35.439 --> 03:08:36.710 align:start position:0%
by their town council or boards of
selectmen

03:08:36.710 --> 03:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
to serve on the commission
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
so with and actually two of them are
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
here today so
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
now with that
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass would they be
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
not allowed to vote on the commission
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
even though it's a statewide commission
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
in the statute setting that up which was
 
03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
hb 737 in 2019
 
03:08:56.960 --> 03:08:57.910 align:start position:0%
hb 737 in 2019
they

03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:08:59.910 --> 03:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
they have to be appointed they're only
 
03:09:02.790 --> 03:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
representing that local jurisdiction
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe that would be a
 
03:09:06.150 --> 03:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
conflict because i believe this only
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
pertains to local boards
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i i also want to clarify something
 
03:09:11.670 --> 03:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
that representative clee had mentioned
 
03:09:11.680 --> 03:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
that representative clee had mentioned
earlier

03:09:13.030 --> 03:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
earlier
i

03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
i she mentioned um something about the
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
city charter um and how that was set up
 
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
i should have mentioned earlier that
 
03:09:23.349 --> 03:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's a potential conflict with city
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
charters as well but that's going to be
 
03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
an individualized basis based you know
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
there are 13 cities they all have
 
03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
different charters with different
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
provisions so
 
03:09:32.469 --> 03:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
i just don't know off the top of my head
 
03:09:34.229 --> 03:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
which ones have ex officios and which do
 
03:09:34.239 --> 03:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
which ones have ex officios and which do
not

03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:46.790 --> 03:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
we had uh three in support and 34
 
03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
we had uh three in support and 34
opposed

03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
and on the last bill hb 1122 it was uh
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
30 support zero opposed
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%

03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the committee
 
03:10:04.239 --> 03:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask the committee

03:10:06.070 --> 03:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%

thing you'll share with us yeah i want

03:12:03.910 --> 03:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
well thanks for coming to testify
 
03:12:06.309 --> 03:12:06.319 align:start position:0%
the good news is we're going to
 
03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
give you an opportunity to testify
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
the bad news is the sponsor of the bill
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
wants to withdraw the bill
 
03:12:15.750 --> 03:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
which at this point
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
i can't personally withdraw it but you
 
03:12:19.510 --> 03:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
should know
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
that when it comes time to testify on
 
03:12:23.030 --> 03:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
in front of the house
 
03:12:28.150 --> 03:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
when the sponsor says kill this bill
 
03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
99 of the time it gets killed so want
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
you this is kind of an effort thing how
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
much effort you're going to put in this
 
03:12:37.030 --> 03:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony you're here so i'm going to
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
give you an opportunity to testify and
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
we'll take we'll take the appropriate
 
03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
notes but just know that the sponsor has
 
03:13:11.830 --> 03:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think everybody's here position okay
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
i can certainly register that in our
 
03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:22.590 align:start position:0%
i can certainly register that in our
documentation

03:13:22.590 --> 03:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:43.269 --> 03:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
at this point i hope you didn't have to
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
drive a long way to come and hear that
 
03:13:51.030 --> 03:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
so we probably should not stay
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
you can if you want but
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
you're not there's not going to be
 
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any fireworks
 
03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:00.950 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any fireworks
okay

03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:14:03.190 --> 03:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
if you promise
 
03:14:04.630 --> 03:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
leave each other a business that
 
03:14:04.640 --> 03:14:06.389 align:start position:0%
leave each other a business that
probably

03:14:06.389 --> 03:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:14:08.830 --> 03:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
needs the time thank
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
you that's right go down tell them lunch
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:47.670 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:47.680 --> 03:15:12.469 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:15.750 --> 03:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
hey jim yes sir i have uh
 
03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
some coffee stained research
 
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
people had some questions about when a
 
03:15:22.870 --> 03:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is required
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
oh yeah so this kind of you want to pass
 
03:15:26.950 --> 03:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
that around that kind of answers that
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
and so i i'm glad you did that because
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:46.550 --> 03:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
so i also found out then from paul
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
and this is this has changed our opinion
 
03:15:52.070 --> 03:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
that in order to require that fiscal
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
note after the fact that he would begin
 
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
it would require
 
03:15:58.389 --> 03:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
a vote of the full committee in
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
our opinion was our collective thought
 
03:16:06.630 --> 03:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
was the fiscal loan is not going to
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
change our mind on the four bills that
 
03:16:09.830 --> 03:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
we are considering
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
so it's probably not the prudent idea
 
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
but if we were going to waste the time
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
exactly so
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna we're not gonna go that
 
03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
way but this is this is helpful thank
 
03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:19.429 align:start position:0%
way but this is this is helpful thank
you

03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to make a copy of that
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
but i need that coffee stand back
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
you can have the coffee stay like 14
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
14 44 i'll make note of that okay thank
 
03:16:28.479 --> 03:16:55.830 align:start position:0%
14 44 i'll make note of that okay thank
you

03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
when did we hear that
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah the the uh we don't
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily post the exec sessions
 
03:17:22.070 --> 03:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
so it's so it's inconvenient for you
 
03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:25.349 align:start position:0%
so it's so it's inconvenient for you
guys

03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
but what did you number did you say
 
03:17:27.439 --> 03:17:37.670 align:start position:0%
but what did you number did you say
1-3

03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:39.349 --> 03:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
i will yeah as soon as i look at my
 
03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:43.120 --> 03:18:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
1507.

03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:11.520 --> 03:18:23.269 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
this had a lot of folks
 
03:32:16.870 --> 03:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.389 --> 03:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
i mean we haven't even heard it yet
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
right but the people that came i said
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
if you want
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
to speak uh
 
03:32:24.080 --> 03:32:25.670 align:start position:0%
to speak uh
openly

03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
openly
 
03:32:27.990 --> 03:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
we'll hear it so you don't have a wasted
 
03:32:29.830 --> 03:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
trip well that was very nice of you to
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
do that because they decided to submit
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
paint cards instead they all are
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.269 --> 03:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
and as i said to my friend richard over
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
there i said there was one time where
 
03:32:54.070 --> 03:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
you said that other people should be
 
03:33:17.590 --> 03:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:17.600 --> 03:33:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:33:21.190 --> 03:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
and i mean that in the nicest way have
 
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
no better way to clean the bottom of the
 
03:33:32.479 --> 03:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
no better way to clean the bottom of the
boat

03:33:46.070 --> 03:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:17.750 --> 03:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.750 --> 03:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:45.510 --> 03:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
that year i think we had something like
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
eight freshmen on the committee that
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.239 --> 03:35:09.110 align:start position:0%

i'm here to introduce house bill 1172
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
which does in fact have a finance note
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it says that
 
03:54:27.349 --> 03:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
while current statute requires that
 
03:54:29.670 --> 03:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
towns and all jurisdictions provide
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
recycling and composting facility for
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
people who live in the town
 
03:54:34.720 --> 03:54:36.389 align:start position:0%
people who live in the town
individual

03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
managers or owners of uh
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
housing are not required to do that i
 
03:54:43.990 --> 03:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a compost pile at my
 
03:54:46.550 --> 03:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
house if i have a triple i don't have to
 
03:54:50.150 --> 03:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
provide composting abilities for my
 
03:54:54.309 --> 03:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
tenants and uh the purpose of 1172
 
03:54:56.070 --> 03:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:54:56.080 --> 03:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
is to
make

03:54:57.030 --> 03:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
03:54:59.349 --> 03:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
it uh mandatory
 
03:54:59.359 --> 03:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
it uh mandatory
for

03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
public housing
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
to provide abilities for the tenants of
 
03:55:09.429 --> 03:55:09.439 align:start position:0%
that public housing facility to have
 
03:55:12.630 --> 03:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
recycling and composting available
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
for them so that not everything goes
 
03:55:17.429 --> 03:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
into a dumpster
 
03:55:21.189 --> 03:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
and so it says each town so this
 
03:55:21.199 --> 03:55:23.750 align:start position:0%
and so it says each town so this
it

03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
requires that residents of public
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
housing located in the town have access
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
to a composting and waste recycling
 
03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:31.429 align:start position:0%
to a composting and waste recycling
facility

03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
and i understand that that the purpose
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill was to make it so that there
 
03:55:38.150 --> 03:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
was not single stream
 
03:55:38.160 --> 03:55:39.269 align:start position:0%
was not single stream
trash

03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
trash
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
at public facilities
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
and i've now told you all i know about
 
03:55:45.750 --> 03:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you thank you you did very
 
03:55:49.830 --> 03:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
well the the
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
the level of support for this bill is
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
for in support 12 opposed
 
03:55:58.150 --> 03:55:58.160 align:start position:0%

03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair maj graves for the
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association we
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
03:56:14.710 --> 03:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
just for the record we do want to be
 
03:56:16.150 --> 03:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
landfill issue solution
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
we certainly know there's a problem we
 
03:56:22.309 --> 03:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
know that it's going to affect the costs
 
03:56:25.030 --> 03:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
for municipalities and for taxpayers and
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
we understand some compromises are going
 
03:56:29.110 --> 03:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
to have to be made down the way
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
as far as this bill goes
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
i would suggest the committee that it's
 
03:56:33.439 --> 03:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
i would suggest the committee that it's
premature

03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
premature
 
03:56:36.630 --> 03:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
their might be some debate over the
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
authority of municipalities to provide
 
03:56:41.760 --> 03:56:42.630 align:start position:0%
authority of municipalities to provide
uh

03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
compost facilities and i say that
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
existence of hp 1402 which will make a
 
03:56:50.870 --> 03:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
local option to collect compost and
 
03:56:53.189 --> 03:56:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's a bill that we are supporting
 
03:56:53.199 --> 03:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
that's a bill that we are supporting
um

03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
and at present most municipalities don't
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
actually have a composting facility so
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
even if you were to require them to
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
collect compost at a public housing
 
03:57:03.120 --> 03:57:05.110 align:start position:0%
collect compost at a public housing
facility

03:57:05.110 --> 03:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
the result of that would be it would get
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
landfilled anyway um and that sort of
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose
 
03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose
um

03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:11.520 --> 03:57:12.790 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:15.429 --> 03:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
i think until we have something in place
 
03:57:17.510 --> 03:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
that has more
 
03:57:17.520 --> 03:57:19.189 align:start position:0%
that has more
um

03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:21.670 --> 03:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
adopts sort of a broader statewide
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
approach to composting or we look at
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
that in more detail
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
um i think it's a little premature to
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
start on this end of things
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
because just simply because there just
 
03:57:33.830 --> 03:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
isn't this this ability to do anything
 
03:57:35.349 --> 03:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
other than landfill this material at
 
03:57:36.870 --> 03:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
this moment in time
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
 
03:57:39.199 --> 03:57:40.150 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions
so

03:57:40.150 --> 03:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
you uh you believe it's premature
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
an approach that
 
03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
is statewide well i i would assume the
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of having a compost
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
facility or
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
starting to collect materials for
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
composting would be to make compost
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
which then could be
 
03:58:00.710 --> 03:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
sold used on agricultural fields
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
we're missing the middle step we
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know we might start collecting it at
 
03:58:09.910 --> 03:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
public housing for instance um
 
03:58:09.920 --> 03:58:10.950 align:start position:0%
public housing for instance um
but

03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
it we don't have anywhere in the middle
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
for it to go
 
03:58:17.349 --> 03:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that's where we are at this stage
 
03:58:19.990 --> 03:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
any questions for the nhma yes
 
03:58:20.000 --> 03:58:22.710 align:start position:0%
any questions for the nhma yes
yes

03:58:22.710 --> 03:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you uh for
 
03:58:32.229 --> 03:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
i want to phrase it in the form of a
 
03:58:36.710 --> 03:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
question um there's two parts to it one
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
is the composting and waste recycling
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
you know as a city we have a recycling
 
03:58:46.030 --> 03:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
um and we have had recycling since uh
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
1989 when it was a pilot and now it's a
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
in nashua we also have a private
 
03:58:58.710 --> 03:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
composting where individuals pay and you
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
know it picks up and it's
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's working very well
 
03:59:02.800 --> 03:59:03.590 align:start position:0%
it's working very well
for

03:59:03.590 --> 03:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
me personally in terms of and i've
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
been able to get more of my neighbors
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.160 --> 03:59:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
you've

03:59:15.189 --> 03:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
you've
 
03:59:21.150 --> 03:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
state-wide or
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
state-mandated is it only for zoning and
 
03:59:30.389 --> 03:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
housing or is it any uh
 
03:59:32.389 --> 03:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
policies that
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
comes down from the state so the
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't have the option
 
03:59:37.920 --> 03:59:39.269 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't have the option
so

03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:42.150 --> 03:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
our policy really boils down to
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
really two
 
03:59:45.990 --> 03:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
two things one it either takes away
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
local control so there's currently local
 
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
authority to do whatever it is
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
or two it's going to cost the
 
03:59:53.670 --> 03:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
municipality money
 
03:59:53.680 --> 03:59:54.389 align:start position:0%
municipality money
so

03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:56.710 --> 03:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
something like zoning would take away
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
local control
 
03:59:58.560 --> 03:59:59.830 align:start position:0%
local control
whereas

03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
04:00:01.590 --> 04:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know some sort of state mandate for
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities to provide
 
04:00:06.469 --> 04:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
some specific service is going to cost
 
04:00:08.309 --> 04:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
them money
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
as well as take away the local control
 
04:00:13.590 --> 04:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what that basically is what
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
it is i mean our policies are much
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
longer than that but that's what it
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
boils down to
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes go ahead
 
04:00:24.950 --> 04:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
04:00:27.030 --> 04:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
in that case you know currently
 
04:00:29.110 --> 04:00:29.120 align:start position:0%
different municipalities and
 
04:00:30.309 --> 04:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
different communities are doing
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
different things
 
04:00:34.710 --> 04:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
and if there's a good uh program there's
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
a good a model that's working in one
 
04:00:37.920 --> 04:00:39.269 align:start position:0%
a good a model that's working in one
community

04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:00:41.510 --> 04:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
how do we spread that across the state
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
or across other communities what kind of
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
incentive is there or what's the
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism well so for for waste uh for
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
example you know we have
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
few landfills in the state and the
 
04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
information that i've received from des
 
04:00:59.189 --> 04:00:59.199 align:start position:0%
is that essentially they're filling up
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
and they're going to fill up
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
over the next decade or so and then
 
04:01:04.229 --> 04:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to figure out where
 
04:01:06.150 --> 04:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
we send our waste and if we send it out
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
of state it's going to be much more
 
04:01:08.469 --> 04:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
expensive it's going to be more
 
04:01:09.670 --> 04:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
expensive for
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
you know the municipalities who are
 
04:01:13.030 --> 04:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
obviously going to pass that on to the
 
04:01:13.040 --> 04:01:14.950 align:start position:0%
obviously going to pass that on to the
taxpayers

04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to think of solutions to
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
not do that
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
part of that may be composting i'm not
 
04:01:24.229 --> 04:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
an expert at
 
04:01:24.239 --> 04:01:25.300 align:start position:0%
an expert at
everything

04:01:25.300 --> 04:01:25.310 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:01:25.310 --> 04:01:26.550 align:start position:0%
everything
[Music]

04:01:26.550 --> 04:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:01:26.560 --> 04:01:27.349 align:start position:0%
[Music]
and

04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:27.359 --> 04:01:28.070 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:28.080 --> 04:01:29.110 align:start position:0%
and
so

04:01:29.110 --> 04:01:29.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:30.870 --> 04:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know when we can expand
 
04:01:33.269 --> 04:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
a recycling programs and we expand reuse
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
programs when we can expand things that
 
04:01:37.110 --> 04:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
are going to lower
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
the speed at which we're filling those
 
04:01:38.640 --> 04:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
the speed at which we're filling those
landfills

04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to save us money
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's something that we can
 
04:01:44.000 --> 04:01:45.030 align:start position:0%
and therefore it's something that we can
support

04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:01:46.630 --> 04:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's why i suggest this is
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
premature because it's possible
 
04:01:51.510 --> 04:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to see widespread adoption
 
04:01:54.950 --> 04:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
of composting as a local option there
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
might be some sort of state incentive to
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
do composting i know that that's
 
04:02:00.870 --> 04:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
something that vermont has has looked at
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
has done
 
04:02:01.920 --> 04:02:02.950 align:start position:0%
has done
um

04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
and i you know i don't know the
 
04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
economics of that but i'd be certainly
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
interested to hear more about it um and
 
04:02:10.229 --> 04:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
if that's something that that works out
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
that can you know save us money we
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
since you brought up vermont um i
 
04:02:21.030 --> 04:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
happened to
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
straddle between the two place a lot
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
more more recently because of
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
our first grandchild and uh so in that
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
you have you know not only that
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:02:33.680 --> 04:02:34.790 align:start position:0%
they have
zero

04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
zero
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh waste
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
in the garbage you can't put it has to
 
04:02:42.229 --> 04:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
go compost either you do locally or city
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
run or state and also no plastics in
 
04:02:48.710 --> 04:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
there you know so there's a lot of
 
04:02:48.720 --> 04:02:50.630 align:start position:0%
there you know so there's a lot of
uh

04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
spokes to the wheel
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely and you know and so
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
in independently doing it or
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
collectively doing it
 
04:03:01.269 --> 04:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
is a whole different ballgame how the
 
04:03:04.229 --> 04:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
wheel can roll right so from that angle
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think all these things coming together
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
the waste management the construction
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
waste and this would be so wouldn't you
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
believe that this has to be looked
 
04:03:13.279 --> 04:03:14.309 align:start position:0%
believe that this has to be looked
together

04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:03:16.309 --> 04:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
i i agree i think there since we are a
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
small state i think that we're going to
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
have statewide solutions that we're
 
04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
going to look to as i mentioned in the
 
04:03:21.990 --> 04:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
beginning there there are going to be
 
04:03:24.150 --> 04:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
compromises that need to be made simply
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
because it's in the best interest of of
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
the state and the state's ability to you
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
know deal with this issue because it's
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
not like we're going to get rid of waste
 
04:03:31.359 --> 04:03:32.550 align:start position:0%
not like we're going to get rid of waste
altogether

04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:03:38.309 --> 04:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:03:38.319 --> 04:03:39.269 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:42.469 --> 04:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
my first problem with this bill is
 
04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure what the
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
meaning of public housing is could you
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
provide that
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
i do not have a definition of public
 
04:03:50.720 --> 04:03:52.950 align:start position:0%
i do not have a definition of public
housing

04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
all right could i have follow-up please
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh i i believe there's a
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
requirement in the constitution that
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
says that
 
04:04:02.399 --> 04:04:04.150 align:start position:0%
says that
the

04:04:04.150 --> 04:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
legislature can't pass any laws that uh
 
04:04:08.720 --> 04:04:09.910 align:start position:0%
legislature can't pass any laws that uh
uh

04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
increase cost
 
04:04:15.910 --> 04:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
or are unmandated or unfunded uh cost
 
04:04:18.150 --> 04:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh do you think there'll be a
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
provide composting
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
so i believe you're referring to article
 
04:04:26.319 --> 04:04:27.750 align:start position:0%
so i believe you're referring to article
28a

04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
28a
 
04:04:27.760 --> 04:04:28.630 align:start position:0%
28a
which

04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:04:28.640 --> 04:04:29.830 align:start position:0%
which
which

04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
would prohibit these new and new
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
program costs on top of municipalities
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
i think that is a legitimate concern in
 
04:04:42.150 --> 04:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
this particular case
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
and in addition this is in part why
 
04:04:46.710 --> 04:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
suggested uh that this this bill is
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
premature because
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's possible that the state comes up
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
with a solution in the next several
 
04:04:53.120 --> 04:04:54.150 align:start position:0%
with a solution in the next several
years

04:04:54.150 --> 04:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:04:54.160 --> 04:04:55.030 align:start position:0%
years
where

04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:04:57.990 --> 04:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
they can profitably uh
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
make and use compost so for example one
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the things we've been doing at
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities
 
04:05:04.479 --> 04:05:05.269 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities
is

04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:05:08.950 --> 04:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
the solids have been turned into
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
a form of compost more or less and that
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
has been
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
able to offset some of the costs of
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
operating the wastewater treatment
 
04:05:16.000 --> 04:05:17.349 align:start position:0%
operating the wastewater treatment
facility

04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:05:19.269 --> 04:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
because that has been able to be sold to
 
04:05:19.279 --> 04:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
because that has been able to be sold to
farmers

04:05:20.360 --> 04:05:20.370 align:start position:0%
farmers
 
04:05:20.370 --> 04:05:21.510 align:start position:0%
farmers
[Music]

04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
there's an issue at present about um
 
04:05:24.720 --> 04:05:25.990 align:start position:0%
there's an issue at present about um
about

04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:05:28.389 --> 04:05:28.399 align:start position:0%
you know chemical compounds like pfas
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
and how exactly those interact with with
 
04:05:34.000 --> 04:05:35.110 align:start position:0%
and how exactly those interact with with
the

04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
those materials
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
in the in the future it's possible that
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
we'd have a situation where
 
04:05:43.269 --> 04:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
um collecting compost makes sense for
 
04:05:45.590 --> 04:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
the state and for municipalities because
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to offset some costs
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
associated with waste removal
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
but it's really hard to say because as
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
we've seen with the recycling market
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
when china stopped accepting a number of
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
plastics and other materials from
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
non-chinese sources
 
04:06:04.389 --> 04:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
we saw that basically the recycling
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
market collapsed and we saw a lot of
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
costs go into that and a lot of those
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
materials had to be
 
04:06:10.239 --> 04:06:11.349 align:start position:0%
materials had to be
landfilled

04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
landfilled
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
upswing in domestic recycling
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
facilities since that time
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
and a number of items which weren't
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
previously profitable such as glass are
 
04:06:24.150 --> 04:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
now profitable
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
and assisting to offset costs so
 
04:06:28.710 --> 04:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
i couldn't predict the market it's
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
possible that in the future it would be
 
04:06:32.790 --> 04:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
something that wouldn't cost money um
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
but at present as i mentioned there's no
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's no middle in in this system um
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
so even if you were to set up this
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
composting facility or composting
 
04:06:42.640 --> 04:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
composting facility or composting
collection

04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
collection
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
this material would end up being
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
landfilled so essentially all you're
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
doing is putting up another dumpster or
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
another bin
 
04:06:50.000 --> 04:06:51.349 align:start position:0%
another bin
um

04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't really seem to
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
accomplish i would assume what the what
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
the sponsor's intent is or
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
really uh offset the
 
04:07:02.229 --> 04:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
offset the costs here
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you does it make sense
 
04:07:05.520 --> 04:07:11.030 align:start position:0%
well thank you does it make sense
to

04:07:11.030 --> 04:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.790 --> 04:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
well i'll come back to that
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:07:19.439 --> 04:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
oh

04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's okay thank you mr chair and and
 
04:07:31.750 --> 04:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr grace for taking my
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned earlier um hb
 
04:07:34.960 --> 04:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned earlier um hb
1406.

04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
1406.
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
if that bill were to pass would that
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
would it make this bill in your opinion
 
04:07:41.920 --> 04:07:44.710 align:start position:0%
would it make this bill in your opinion
unnecessary

04:07:44.710 --> 04:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:07:44.720 --> 04:07:45.830 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
um

04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
well they're very different bills so hp
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
1402 would just be a local option to
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
collect compost
 
04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
collect compost
that's

04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
currently not in the waste management
 
04:07:57.600 --> 04:07:59.269 align:start position:0%
currently not in the waste management
statutes

04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
it appears from what representative
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
manjapuri has said that some
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities are doing that
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
and i've certainly heard that myself
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm not
 
04:08:09.269 --> 04:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
sure if
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
you know why that's needed um i don't i
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
don't recall from the from the hearing
 
04:08:15.750 --> 04:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
but at least it would make it explicit
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
that they can collect compost and
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
presumably it'll be the same with
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
anything else is that you'd have
 
04:08:22.080 --> 04:08:22.870 align:start position:0%
anything else is that you'd have
a

04:08:22.870 --> 04:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
number of essentially small producers
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
we'd all have our little compost bin
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
we'd all bring it to the transfer
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
station or wherever and then
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
collectively would make a lot of compost
 
04:08:34.229 --> 04:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
and then then the municipality could
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
sell that apply that to you know give it
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the county farm whatever they're
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
going to do with it
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay and um
 
04:08:44.070 --> 04:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes mr chair thank you
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
with this bill it
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
it also includes waste recycling access
 
04:08:49.439 --> 04:08:50.149 align:start position:0%
it also includes waste recycling access
to

04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
waste recycling do you know how many new
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipalities
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
don't currently do not have waste
 
04:08:56.319 --> 04:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
don't currently do not have waste
recycling

04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%

04:08:57.600 --> 04:08:58.790 align:start position:0%

04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
and it and if not do they are there
 
04:09:01.840 --> 04:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
and it and if not do they are there
access

04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
or do they rely on private waste
 
04:09:04.800 --> 04:09:06.070 align:start position:0%
or do they rely on private waste
recycling

04:09:06.070 --> 04:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
04:09:06.080 --> 04:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
recycling
uh

04:09:07.269 --> 04:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:09:09.990 --> 04:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
programs that their
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
their residents can use so every
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
municipality minimum has to provide
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
access to a transfer station and
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
different transfer stations are
 
04:09:18.469 --> 04:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
different rules so i can tell you from
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
my own uh my own experience i used to
 
04:09:22.469 --> 04:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
live in sugar hill and sometimes i'd use
 
04:09:23.750 --> 04:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
the franconia one which i was supposed
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
to use and sometimes i'd use a little
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
one because that's where i worked
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the different facilities took
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
different materials and
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
presumably they sent them out to
 
04:09:35.110 --> 04:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
different markets um
 
04:09:37.110 --> 04:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
i assume the same thing would be would
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
be the case you know kind of across the
 
04:09:41.429 --> 04:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
board okay thank you
 
04:09:43.349 --> 04:09:43.359 align:start position:0%

04:09:43.359 --> 04:09:47.269 align:start position:0%

which is
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
a pretty urban district
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
which has a number of
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
public housing projects in it
 
04:11:52.319 --> 04:11:54.309 align:start position:0%
public housing projects in it
and

04:11:54.309 --> 04:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:54.319 --> 04:11:58.870 align:start position:0%
and
currently

04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:58.880 --> 04:12:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
currently

04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
the way it works is that public housing
 
04:12:02.159 --> 04:12:03.750 align:start position:0%
the way it works is that public housing
projects

04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
for wasting them
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
waste disposal just have
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
a single dumpster for
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
throwing trash in
 
04:12:11.920 --> 04:12:13.510 align:start position:0%
throwing trash in
wow

04:12:13.510 --> 04:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
wow
 
04:12:15.110 --> 04:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
so i happen to i happen to live in
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
public housing myself and
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
the way i solve it is
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
to bring my compost and recycling over
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
to my parents house who live a few
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:29.590 --> 04:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
now other people who live in my
 
04:12:32.070 --> 04:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
apartment building don't necessarily
 
04:12:32.080 --> 04:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
apartment building don't necessarily
have

04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
family who lives nearby though
 
04:12:35.920 --> 04:12:36.710 align:start position:0%
family who lives nearby though
um

04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
so if they want to compost or recycle
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
and don't know
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
anyone around
 
04:12:44.479 --> 04:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
anyone around
um

04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:45.760 --> 04:12:46.950 align:start position:0%
um
that

04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:49.110 --> 04:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
and don't know anyone around that they
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
can bring theirs over to then they're
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
pretty much just
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
out of luck
 
04:12:55.279 --> 04:12:57.670 align:start position:0%
out of luck
so

04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:12:59.439 --> 04:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
i i
um

04:13:01.030 --> 04:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:01.040 --> 04:13:02.389 align:start position:0%
um
i

04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:13:05.750 --> 04:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
requested this bill to uh
 
04:13:05.760 --> 04:13:08.309 align:start position:0%

04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
residents of public housing
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
access to
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
compost and recycling um
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
so as for the specific language um
 
04:13:20.479 --> 04:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
so as for the specific language um
so

04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
um it says
 
04:13:29.110 --> 04:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
um each town um
 
04:13:29.120 --> 04:13:30.790 align:start position:0%
um each town um
uh

04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:13:30.800 --> 04:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
uh
um

04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:33.510 --> 04:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming they went with that just
 
04:13:36.870 --> 04:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:38.550 --> 04:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's what the
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
section is about is about towns i
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
intended it for it to
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
apply to all municipalities um both
 
04:13:49.670 --> 04:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
cities and towns so if you think that an
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
to change
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
town to municipality would
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
help things i would be open to that
 
04:13:58.960 --> 04:14:00.630 align:start position:0%
help things i would be open to that
um

04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
so as far as having access to a compost
 
04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
or waste recycling facility
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
my thinking there
 
04:14:11.110 --> 04:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't like it doesn't need to be an
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
entire big building or anything
 
04:14:14.080 --> 04:14:15.269 align:start position:0%
entire big building or anything
like

04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
my thinking was just basically
 
04:14:18.239 --> 04:14:19.750 align:start position:0%
my thinking was just basically
that

04:14:19.750 --> 04:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
public housing agencies
 
04:14:21.760 --> 04:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
public housing agencies
would

04:14:23.110 --> 04:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:14:23.120 --> 04:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
would
then

04:14:24.550 --> 04:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
add at make make a second dumpster
 
04:14:26.800 --> 04:14:28.389 align:start position:0%
add at make make a second dumpster
available

04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
for people who want to separate out
 
04:14:30.800 --> 04:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
for people who want to separate out
their

04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:14:35.590 --> 04:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
recycling compost from their trash or
 
04:14:37.189 --> 04:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
if there's only room for one dumpster
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
like put just put a divider in it or
 
04:14:38.960 --> 04:14:40.309 align:start position:0%
like put just put a divider in it or
something

04:14:40.309 --> 04:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:14:40.319 --> 04:14:41.670 align:start position:0%
something
um

04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:41.680 --> 04:14:44.630 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
in talking with some people
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
about the bill um
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
i've had some interest
 
04:14:55.920 --> 04:14:57.110 align:start position:0%
i've had some interest
from

04:14:57.110 --> 04:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
the environmental perspective just
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
because i know
 
04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people
 
04:15:06.550 --> 04:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
the forest lake people for example
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
improve waste management policies
 
04:15:12.080 --> 04:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
improve waste management policies
um

04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
in this state that's
 
04:15:18.229 --> 04:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
and yeah well i i think this bill will
 
04:15:20.070 --> 04:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
do that that's not actually where i was
 
04:15:20.080 --> 04:15:21.429 align:start position:0%
do that that's not actually where i was
originally

04:15:21.429 --> 04:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
originally
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
coming from though i was mostly just
 
04:15:22.960 --> 04:15:24.469 align:start position:0%
coming from though i was mostly just
seeing

04:15:24.469 --> 04:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
this as
 
04:15:30.309 --> 04:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
a bill to improve quality of life
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:35.510 --> 04:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
to let
 
04:15:40.229 --> 04:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
public housing facilities be
 
04:15:42.070 --> 04:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
cleaner and
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
more orderly so
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
my my neighbors who
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
recycle and compost can do so
 
04:15:51.920 --> 04:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
recycle and compost can do so
um

04:15:53.750 --> 04:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:53.760 --> 04:15:55.429 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:15:55.429 --> 04:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:57.590 --> 04:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's my bill and i'll take any
 
04:15:57.600 --> 04:15:58.630 align:start position:0%
that's my bill and i'll take any
questions

04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:15:58.640 --> 04:16:01.349 align:start position:0%
questions
representatives

04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
so when you refer to public housing are
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
you are you referring to subsidized
 
04:16:12.830 --> 04:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
housing yeah um so
 
04:16:17.510 --> 04:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:17.520 --> 04:16:18.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
the concord housing
 
04:16:24.790 --> 04:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.590 --> 04:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
accepts section eight
 
04:16:27.600 --> 04:16:28.469 align:start position:0%
accepts section eight
um

04:16:28.469 --> 04:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
section eight payments i'm pretty sure
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
how how it works um
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:16:37.830 --> 04:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
and my thinking is that
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:41.600 --> 04:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
the state has a say
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
in dealing with them
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:55.830 --> 04:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
set conditions for
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
bear with me while i try to formulate
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
this question
 
04:17:19.110 --> 04:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
is there anything in existing law that
 
04:17:19.120 --> 04:17:20.309 align:start position:0%
is there anything in existing law that
prevents

04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
residents of subsidized housing
 
04:17:23.600 --> 04:17:25.030 align:start position:0%
residents of subsidized housing
from

04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
composting or using
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities
 
04:17:30.239 --> 04:17:32.550 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities
well

04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
or is it just a it's a financial
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
hardship or a logistical hardship i'm
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
trying to get at what the
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
specific problem is
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's more the financial and logistical
 
04:17:44.469 --> 04:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
part that's the
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
issue like
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know at
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
my apartment building
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
so my parents are able to compost
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
because they have a backyard and
 
04:17:54.640 --> 04:17:55.510 align:start position:0%
because they have a backyard and
um

04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
they have a garden that they can spread
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
the compost in
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
my apartment building though does not
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
have any backyard or any green space
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
around it so there's not really any
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.110 --> 04:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah if people wanted to compost here
 
04:18:13.120 --> 04:18:14.149 align:start position:0%
so yeah if people wanted to compost here
they

04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:18:14.159 --> 04:18:15.110 align:start position:0%
they
um

04:18:15.110 --> 04:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
like pretty much lonely space available
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk which is not an appropriate
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:25.520 --> 04:18:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.720 --> 04:18:32.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:18:32.389 --> 04:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
as for the recycling part um
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
yeah there is a recycling con place in
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
concord that
 
04:18:39.199 --> 04:18:41.510 align:start position:0%
concord that
um

04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:41.520 --> 04:18:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
residents could take their recycling to
 
04:18:49.110 --> 04:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
well a lot of
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know it being public housing
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the residents are poor and
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have cars
 
04:18:58.000 --> 04:18:59.189 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have cars
like

04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:19:00.870 --> 04:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know i i i don't have a car myself i
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
walk most places around the city and i
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
see a lot of my neighbors
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
my neighbors um also get everywhere by
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
walking too so
 
04:19:13.680 --> 04:19:16.630 align:start position:0%
walking too so
um

04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
um as far as i know
 
04:19:24.790 --> 04:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
our local recycling center is out on the
 
04:19:24.800 --> 04:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
our local recycling center is out on the
heights

04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
heights
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
which and in a location that is not
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
along any of the
 
04:19:31.760 --> 04:19:33.110 align:start position:0%
along any of the
public

04:19:33.110 --> 04:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
bus lines that are
 
04:19:35.680 --> 04:19:38.149 align:start position:0%
bus lines that are
available

04:19:38.149 --> 04:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
for residents in the city so
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
if someone without
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
if someone without a car wanted to
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
get out to
 
04:19:51.510 --> 04:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
get out to the recycling center
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
um even if they did take the bus they'd
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
still have to then
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
walk a ways
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
to get to it after their final bus stop
 
04:20:00.640 --> 04:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
to get to it after their final bus stop
and

04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:05.110 --> 04:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's basically prohibitive to
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
anyone actually doing that
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so just a brief follow-up
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
oh maybe not so brief so as i read um
 
04:20:19.520 --> 04:20:21.349 align:start position:0%
oh maybe not so brief so as i read um
149

04:20:21.349 --> 04:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
149
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
and 17 it's clear to me
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
that reducing
 
04:20:29.349 --> 04:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
input into the waste stream and
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
composting has been identified by this
 
04:20:32.319 --> 04:20:33.590 align:start position:0%
composting has been identified by this
body

04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
as a state interest compelling state
 
04:20:36.560 --> 04:20:37.670 align:start position:0%
as a state interest compelling state
interest

04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:20:39.750 --> 04:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
and something that new hampshire wants
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
providing access
 
04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
to all new hampshire residents
 
04:20:50.560 --> 04:20:51.670 align:start position:0%
to all new hampshire residents
to

04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
composting and recycling facilities is
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
of critical importance and it's
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me to hear
 
04:20:58.399 --> 04:20:59.590 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me to hear
that

04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
there is a group of people
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
that are effectively disenfranchised
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
from that access
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
um so i so i'm actually um
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm wondering if
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
trying to turn this into a question mr
 
04:21:15.439 --> 04:21:16.950 align:start position:0%
trying to turn this into a question mr
chair

04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:21:16.960 --> 04:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
chair
um

04:21:17.750 --> 04:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:20.710 --> 04:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering if you might
 
04:21:23.750 --> 04:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
want to reference that in your bill
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
by by making a small amendment that just
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
refers back to the the state adopted
 
04:21:30.399 --> 04:21:31.910 align:start position:0%
refers back to the the state adopted
policy

04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
that this is a goal
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.070 --> 04:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
and as a law it should be
 
04:21:47.830 --> 04:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
abided by and accessible to all citizens
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
their situation
 
04:21:52.550 --> 04:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
um can you
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
um provide a reference or like what what
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
rsa number i should or where this goal
 
04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's 149. oh okay previously
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
title 10 public health chapter 149
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
and it's um
 
04:22:12.560 --> 04:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
and it's um
m11

04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
m11
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
the very beginning is the public benefit
 
04:22:16.560 --> 04:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
the very beginning is the public benefit
section

04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i can
 
04:22:25.680 --> 04:22:26.550 align:start position:0%
yeah i can
um

04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
i can i can ask oles to i was planning
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
on going by there
 
04:22:33.990 --> 04:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards anyways um
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
so yeah i can ask them to include a
 
04:22:36.239 --> 04:22:37.750 align:start position:0%
so yeah i can ask them to include a
reference

04:22:37.750 --> 04:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
reference
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
to that thank you
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to your
 
04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
comment about where's the proper place
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
to recycle
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
right up the local sidewalk was
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
obviously not a good place
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
my town
 
04:22:52.960 --> 04:22:54.149 align:start position:0%
my town
provides

04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
provides
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
a compost barrel
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
for the residents it's about
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
three feet wide maybe three and a half
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
feet tall and it has all the different
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
vents and so forth you need to use for
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
the compost to actually generate
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
because you certainly want to didn't
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to dump a bunch of garbage
 
04:23:17.670 --> 04:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk or even in the backyard
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
because it will it will attract
 
04:23:20.000 --> 04:23:20.790 align:start position:0%
because it will it will attract
uh

04:23:20.790 --> 04:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:20.800 --> 04:23:22.950 align:start position:0%
uh
undesirable

04:23:22.950 --> 04:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
undesirable
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
small four-footed friends or
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
larger ones too like bears yes
 
04:23:30.149 --> 04:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
so uh would that
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
be a solution if the local community
 
04:23:36.870 --> 04:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
could provide compost
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
facilities in terms of maybe a barrel
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think a barrel would
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
count as a facility if you'd like
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment clarifying that um i could
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
get i could include that in what i asked
 
04:23:50.159 --> 04:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
get i could include that in what i asked
of

04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:23:50.960 --> 04:23:52.870 align:start position:0%
of
ols

04:23:52.870 --> 04:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
ols
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
if the thought is perhaps that would be
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive for the
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
for the individual
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's about 70 dollars for the barrel and
 
04:24:02.469 --> 04:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
i would imagine
 
04:24:04.790 --> 04:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh you could you could
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
on some type of a campaign you could go
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
around and convince
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
local townships to maybe donate those
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
barrels where people ask for
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.269 --> 04:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative powell i
 
04:24:22.550 --> 04:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
missed you
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question pertains
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
to line four in in the use of the word
 
04:24:29.439 --> 04:24:30.790 align:start position:0%
to line four in in the use of the word
access

04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to me what the definition
 
04:24:34.630 --> 04:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
is of that word and and also the
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
implications and it may have already
 
04:24:37.199 --> 04:24:38.469 align:start position:0%
implications and it may have already
been

04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
spoken to in part but would you agree
 
04:24:41.680 --> 04:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
spoken to in part but would you agree
that

04:24:43.830 --> 04:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill and the use of
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
the word access
 
04:24:51.110 --> 04:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
is is unclear at this point
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that needs to be worked on
 
04:24:54.000 --> 04:24:54.790 align:start position:0%
and perhaps that needs to be worked on
um

04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i agree that the word
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
access can be kind of weasely sometimes
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
like you see that
 
04:25:07.349 --> 04:25:07.359 align:start position:0%
health care debates to how there's a
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
difference between providing
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
access to health care and health care
 
04:25:10.960 --> 04:25:11.990 align:start position:0%
access to health care and health care
itself

04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:25:14.309 --> 04:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
the thing is here i'm not really sure of
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
what language would be better though so
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
if you have a suggestion of
 
04:25:24.880 --> 04:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
if you have a suggestion of
um

04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
some word to use instead of access i
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
would be open to that
 
04:25:31.279 --> 04:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
would be open to that
um

04:25:33.030 --> 04:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:33.040 --> 04:25:35.189 align:start position:0%
um
like

04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
when i'm thinking
 
04:25:37.040 --> 04:25:38.710 align:start position:0%
when i'm thinking
access

04:25:38.710 --> 04:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%

thinking of
 
04:25:52.399 --> 04:25:53.269 align:start position:0%
thinking of
um

04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%

this is in addition to we have curbside
recycling

04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%

composting
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
our household
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
recycles or compost
 
04:27:07.349 --> 04:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 pounds of food waste
 
04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
in one year 2 000 pounds of food waste
 
04:27:12.469 --> 04:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
just by collecting in a bucket and i
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
hear you and uh you know grow nashua i
 
04:27:15.840 --> 04:27:16.710 align:start position:0%
hear you and uh you know grow nashua i
would

04:27:16.710 --> 04:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:27:19.349 --> 04:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
recommend go look at grow nashua and
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
they have really expanded which is a
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
public private partnership where they do
 
04:27:26.630 --> 04:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
the curbside pickup of
 
04:27:26.640 --> 04:27:27.910 align:start position:0%
the curbside pickup of
composting

04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
composting
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
bring their compost back and they also
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
have public gardens where they give
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
people who don't have space to grow
 
04:27:37.990 --> 04:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
their own vegetables
 
04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of different innovative
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
and this is a critical need
 
04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh in our state and it is also a
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing that's important especially with
 
04:27:48.960 --> 04:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
thing that's important especially with
the

04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:49.840 --> 04:27:51.349 align:start position:0%
the
coveted

04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
coveted
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh situation where we have more waste
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
but just sticking with waste recycling
 
04:27:59.830 --> 04:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
and composting our neighboring town have
 
04:27:59.840 --> 04:28:00.790 align:start position:0%
and composting our neighboring town have
you

04:28:00.790 --> 04:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:28:02.950 --> 04:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at what
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
vermont is doing
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:28:10.070 --> 04:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
does a lot of curbside
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
and was that something that you
 
04:28:16.630 --> 04:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
looked at to see how every
 
04:28:16.640 --> 04:28:17.830 align:start position:0%
looked at to see how every
citizen

04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
04:28:20.469 --> 04:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
in the state has access to it
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
so state-run program
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
the thing about um
 
04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
curbside recycling
 
04:28:26.960 --> 04:28:28.630 align:start position:0%
curbside recycling
is

04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:28:28.640 --> 04:28:29.590 align:start position:0%
is
that

04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:29.600 --> 04:28:30.550 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah concord does have curbside
 
04:28:32.080 --> 04:28:35.189 align:start position:0%
yeah concord does have curbside
recycling

04:28:35.189 --> 04:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.790 --> 04:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
and um works for
 
04:28:38.800 --> 04:28:40.309 align:start position:0%
and um works for
households

04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
households
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
where as like um
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
a single family home or even like say a
 
04:28:48.070 --> 04:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
duplex or fourplex or something
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
but for the bigger apartment buildings
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
like the one i live in it's it's like 10
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
floors with 10 units on it per floor so
 
04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
if we put out a curbside recycling
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
bucket for
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
each separate
 
04:29:03.750 --> 04:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
unit in
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
our apartment building
 
04:29:05.920 --> 04:29:06.710 align:start position:0%
our apartment building
there

04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:29:08.550 --> 04:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be enough
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
room for all of them um
 
04:29:13.830 --> 04:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
on the curbside
 
04:29:13.840 --> 04:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
on the curbside
so

04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's why it kind of needs to be
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
that that's why i there's there are
 
04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
situations where i'd see it needs to be
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
um more centralized than everyone having
 
04:29:29.910 --> 04:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
their own um
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
sorry follow-up that i'm not saying each
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
unit have their own bin but in
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
nashua if there is a multi
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
unit dwelling
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
just like you have trash
 
04:29:53.750 --> 04:29:53.760 align:start position:0%

04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
dumpster
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%

04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%

and if we can offer and that also
 
04:30:14.550 --> 04:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
composting having a bin
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
compost bin right next to the dumpster
 
04:30:19.990 --> 04:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
to bring just that that would really
 
04:30:22.469 --> 04:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
help in terms of have you looked at
 
04:30:25.510 --> 04:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
those kind of options um yeah
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:30:30.229 --> 04:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
that i i think those kinds of options
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
could qualify
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%

04:30:35.279 --> 04:30:36.550 align:start position:0%
um for this
um

04:30:36.550 --> 04:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
so yeah i i am aware of
 
04:30:45.990 --> 04:30:46.000 align:start position:0%

so would
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
would a town like mine that has a
 
04:31:19.680 --> 04:31:21.110 align:start position:0%
would a town like mine that has a
curbside

04:31:21.110 --> 04:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
curbside
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
both trash and
 
04:31:23.120 --> 04:31:25.830 align:start position:0%
both trash and
recycling

04:31:25.830 --> 04:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
would that housing authority
 
04:31:30.229 --> 04:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
or could the residents of that housing
 
04:31:30.239 --> 04:31:31.590 align:start position:0%
or could the residents of that housing
authority

04:31:31.590 --> 04:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
petition for please use this
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
state law to ensure that it happens
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah
 
04:31:45.520 --> 04:31:48.309 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah
theoretically

04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
residents could petition for that but um
 
04:31:52.000 --> 04:31:53.030 align:start position:0%
residents could petition for that but um
it's

04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:31:53.040 --> 04:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
it's
difficult

04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
04:31:54.720 --> 04:31:56.710 align:start position:0%
difficult
um

04:31:56.710 --> 04:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:56.720 --> 04:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
um
it

04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:32:00.550 --> 04:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
it it can be difficult sometimes for
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
residents of
 
04:32:04.830 --> 04:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
public housing to
 
04:32:04.840 --> 04:32:06.790 align:start position:0%
public housing to
um

04:32:06.790 --> 04:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:08.790 --> 04:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
to do things like that a lot of times
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
when interacting with the housing
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
authority you know it's always
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
it's a one-way street where they're
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
always like
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
the ones asking
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
you to be the ones to
 
04:32:21.680 --> 04:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
you to be the ones to
um

04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
supply these proofs supply these
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
verifications so you can continue living
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
here and whatever and people don't
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
really realize that
 
04:32:30.479 --> 04:32:31.349 align:start position:0%
really realize that
um

04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
they can
 
04:32:33.199 --> 04:32:34.389 align:start position:0%
they can
make

04:32:34.389 --> 04:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:32:34.399 --> 04:32:36.309 align:start position:0%
make
requests

04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
requests
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
back of the housing authority
 
04:32:41.429 --> 04:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
this is kind of
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
this is kind of
 
04:32:46.000 --> 04:32:46.830 align:start position:0%
this is kind of
my

04:32:46.830 --> 04:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
my um
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
approach to doing this by legislation is
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
so that way
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have to do so
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
themselves so it's to speak up for them
 
04:33:00.479 --> 04:33:01.349 align:start position:0%
themselves so it's to speak up for them
on

04:33:01.349 --> 04:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
i understand from a previous comment you
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
made that the use of the word town will
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
will be amended to include to
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
as municipality well um if you if you
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
think that makes sense um
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
are are you um requesting that are you
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
saying that yes it doesn't i should do
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
that well i'm just saying it may be a
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
flaw in the bill
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
because um i i've worked on other bills
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
but municipality is like the
 
04:33:42.150 --> 04:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
the the given term to refer to
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
04:33:47.029 --> 04:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
a you know a a a governing district i
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
guess it's city or town let me offer
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
i've run into this before and i've
 
04:33:53.680 --> 04:33:54.551 align:start position:0%
i've run into this before and i've
gotten

04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
clarification that
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
the terms town municipality
 
04:33:59.520 --> 04:34:00.869 align:start position:0%
the terms town municipality
city

04:34:00.869 --> 04:34:00.879 align:start position:0%
city
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
village district are all interchangeable
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay so use of town would include the
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
city of concord okay
 
04:34:09.279 --> 04:34:10.150 align:start position:0%
city of concord okay
um

04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then as a follow-up to the question
 
04:34:15.189 --> 04:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
representative power asked
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the word access i also have a
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
question on that i'm interpreting from
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
your response that that is
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
restricted to on-site
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
or would it would have would a resident
 
04:34:29.029 --> 04:34:29.039 align:start position:0%
of public housing
 
04:34:31.670 --> 04:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
because they could perhaps have access
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
to a facility a few miles away
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
that that would fulfill your intent or
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
your intent is strictly to provide
 
04:34:39.520 --> 04:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
your intent is strictly to provide
on-site

04:34:41.750 --> 04:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
on-site
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah my intent was for it to be on
 
04:34:47.349 --> 04:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
site um i can
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
it um
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
yeah i can have the amendment include
 
04:34:54.150 --> 04:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
those words if you think that would be
 
04:34:54.160 --> 04:34:55.670 align:start position:0%
those words if you think that would be
helpful

04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:34:55.680 --> 04:34:56.551 align:start position:0%
helpful
right

04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:34:56.561 --> 04:34:57.269 align:start position:0%
right
or

04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
or do you or
 
04:35:00.629 --> 04:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
do you not want that
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
well i'm just trying to understand the
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
your intent okay
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i would prefer
 
04:35:09.189 --> 04:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
i would prefer it to be on-site
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
okay just because
 
04:35:12.949 --> 04:35:12.959 align:start position:0%
yeah if it's something miles away for
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
people who don't have cars
 
04:35:17.670 --> 04:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
that might be difficult to get to okay
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then follow it
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and and then getting back to the
 
04:35:29.349 --> 04:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
point about the your intent in the bill
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
um you've described
 
04:35:33.269 --> 04:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
that this would apply to public housing
 
04:35:33.279 --> 04:35:34.551 align:start position:0%
that this would apply to public housing
because

04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the density of the residents and the
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of space
 
04:35:41.830 --> 04:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
for them to do their own composting on
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
site but would you agree that that may
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
also occur for other types of housing
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
that may not be public
 
04:35:49.439 --> 04:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
that may not be public
but

04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
maybe in a dense area of a community
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
where there isn't any space so
 
04:35:56.789 --> 04:35:56.799 align:start position:0%
would this
 
04:35:59.189 --> 04:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
only apply to those
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
housing units like that that are
 
04:36:05.590 --> 04:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
publicly subsidized or managed well
 
04:36:08.551 --> 04:36:08.561 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree that those other
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
dense housing developments ought to have
 
04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
these options available to them
 
04:36:18.869 --> 04:36:18.879 align:start position:0%
too um i just wasn't quite as sure
 
04:36:20.310 --> 04:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
04:36:25.269 --> 04:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
the reason i kept it restricted to just
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
public housing is
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
because well it's public it's something
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
that the government already has a hand
 
04:36:33.680 --> 04:36:34.470 align:start position:0%
that the government already has a hand
in

04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:36:34.480 --> 04:36:35.269 align:start position:0%
in
um

04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:35.279 --> 04:36:36.949 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
having the government have a hand in
 
04:36:43.349 --> 04:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
other things
 
04:36:46.230 --> 04:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't already have one in like
 
04:36:48.789 --> 04:36:48.799 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah we could do that but it
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
make the
 
04:36:56.709 --> 04:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
not sure if we i'm not just not sure if
 
04:37:03.189 --> 04:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
we have the authority
 
04:37:03.199 --> 04:37:04.230 align:start position:0%
we have the authority
to

04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
extend it to anyone besides
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
places we have jurisdiction over okay
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i'm a little
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
concerned about the
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
maybe the terms and definitions you
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
might be using right now
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
when you're collecting your data on on
 
04:37:23.670 --> 04:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
i've heard a lot of discussion about
 
04:37:25.439 --> 04:37:27.990 align:start position:0%
i've heard a lot of discussion about
recycling

04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
recycling
 
04:37:30.390 --> 04:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
i think you you would have to agree that
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
composting and recycling are two very
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
different things
 
04:37:36.230 --> 04:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
if you talk about curbside pickup or
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
recycling that happens maybe every week
 
04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
or every other week
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
composting is when you put things
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
into a bin to compost it you usually
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
want them to stay there a good two or
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
three months for the
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
for the organic process to
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
be conducted if you're taking it you're
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
taking eggshells and celery stalks and
 
04:37:57.439 --> 04:37:59.029 align:start position:0%
taking eggshells and celery stalks and
and

04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:59.039 --> 04:38:00.230 align:start position:0%
and
apples

04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
apples
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
in the dumpster that's not composting
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
you got to put you got to put them in a
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
compost heap
 
04:38:09.590 --> 04:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
and let it rot
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
rot down to a level that your parents
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
for example could use and spread in
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
their garden i'm sure your parents
 
04:38:17.269 --> 04:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
aren't spreading banana peels in their
 
04:38:17.279 --> 04:38:18.310 align:start position:0%
aren't spreading banana peels in their
garden

04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
garden
 
04:38:18.320 --> 04:38:19.029 align:start position:0%
garden
so

04:38:19.029 --> 04:38:19.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:19.039 --> 04:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
i just want
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
you to
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
do you understand the uh
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to be
 
04:38:29.910 --> 04:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
rude about this but do you understand
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
the difference between recycling and
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
composting yes i i do understand the
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
difference um i i keep my compost and
 
04:38:39.269 --> 04:38:39.279 align:start position:0%
recycling separate um
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
you know the that i would assume that
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
under this legislation they would be
 
04:38:48.639 --> 04:38:49.990 align:start position:0%
under this legislation they would be
handled

04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
handled
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
separately um
 
04:38:55.830 --> 04:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
the reason i put them together
 
04:38:58.629 --> 04:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
is well just they're both
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
they are they are both
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh very important
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're very different
 
04:39:08.629 --> 04:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
and well they're they're they're in a
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
related subject area um
 
04:39:14.320 --> 04:39:16.390 align:start position:0%
related subject area um
so

04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
i i
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the point is to have
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
both be available like they don't that
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
when implementing it
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
they would require separate treatment
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
but i'm
 
04:39:34.629 --> 04:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
not really
 
04:39:36.390 --> 04:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's necessary
 
04:39:40.948 --> 04:39:40.958 align:start position:0%
to specify that though like i i would
 
04:39:42.788 --> 04:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
think the fact that
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
compost and recycling are separate
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
things would just kind of
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
be something that
 
04:39:48.638 --> 04:39:51.190 align:start position:0%
be something that
um

04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
would be something that people
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question additionally i have a
 
04:40:06.708 --> 04:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
concern with um another word in the bill
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
on line five where you
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
use the word facility
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
to me that's
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
unclear based on your testimony and your
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
could you um further clarify facility
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
because to me the word facility is not
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily a dumpster
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
or a container that was that was one of
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
the ones i was thinking of
 
04:40:32.638 --> 04:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
the ones i was thinking of
um

04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the ones i was thinking of
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
amending um
 
04:40:36.958 --> 04:40:38.788 align:start position:0%
amending um
uh

04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:40.948 --> 04:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
i i do
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
think that yeah facility
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
should probably be
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
replaced and i'll include that in the
 
04:40:48.480 --> 04:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
replaced and i'll include that in the
amendment

04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.590 --> 04:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative a lot of hard work here
 
04:40:57.590 --> 04:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i think probably still some more to
 
04:40:57.600 --> 04:40:58.390 align:start position:0%
and i think probably still some more to
go

04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
go
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um so yeah i have a neighbor so if
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
she could
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%

sanitizer
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
if you want to use it i might need that
 
04:41:24.550 --> 04:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
and and you can wipe the microphone too
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
do excuse me to sound ignorant do i just

04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to
 
04:42:05.670 --> 04:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
mr gallagher i did tell him
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not getting paid to take the garbage
 
04:42:10.788 --> 04:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
out of the kennedy building
 
04:42:13.990 --> 04:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
my father was a drill sergeant
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
and my dad would have felt there are
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
things that you do that are your civic
 
04:42:18.240 --> 04:42:20.868 align:start position:0%
things that you do that are your civic
responsibility

04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
it is appalling to me the number of
 
04:42:23.280 --> 04:42:24.628 align:start position:0%
it is appalling to me the number of
people

04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%

04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm only paying true 17 a month for a
 
04:42:33.040 --> 04:42:34.550 align:start position:0%
i'm only paying true 17 a month for a
one-bedroom

04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
apartment unit with all the amenities
 
04:42:40.150 --> 04:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
i even got my shots
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
they turned it into a vaccination clinic
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
in there i got the covered shots in
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%

04:42:51.670 --> 04:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
different things happen people come to
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
visit somebody
 
04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
some people are in there when they're
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
anything's possible in there
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
the case in point would be thanksgiving
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
weekend i carried out three huge garbage
 
04:43:06.560 --> 04:43:07.990 align:start position:0%
weekend i carried out three huge garbage
bags

04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
bags
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
of food garbage out of the mail room
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
because somebody obviously
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
had come for a visit and didn't know
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
what to do so they just drop it in the
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
mail room excuse me this is a john f
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
kennedy building the mail room you put
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
junk mail in the waste can you don't put
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
two gallons of milk
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay i didn't want to do it
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
but somebody's got to do it
 
04:43:37.430 --> 04:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
and different ones i'll say can you give
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%

04:43:41.190 --> 04:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
type of a hand
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%

offer at demoulas
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's appalling the people that think
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to something for free
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
you really don't get anything for free
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
in life
 
04:44:04.868 --> 04:44:04.878 align:start position:0%
but anyway i'll be 74 in may
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
and as long as i have my boyfriend the
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
cane and i'm strong enough to

carry the garbage out i'm doing the mail
 
04:44:16.230 --> 04:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
room and i'm doing the laundry room too
 
04:44:18.550 --> 04:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
by now some of the younger men in the
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
same age as mr gallagher here
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
10 days in a row i didn't carry one bag
 
04:44:25.200 --> 04:44:27.030 align:start position:0%
10 days in a row i didn't carry one bag
out

04:44:27.030 --> 04:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
they took it out
 
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
they get it
 
04:44:35.030 --> 04:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
i can see the compound
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
compost part of it
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
but like eric was saying
 
04:44:44.390 --> 04:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
you can't put compost on this damn
 
04:44:44.400 --> 04:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
you can't put compost on this damn
sidewalk

04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalk
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
there has to be a place
 
04:44:52.150 --> 04:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
to put it a way to reference
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.040 --> 04:44:56.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:44:56.708 --> 04:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
i have a big mouth and i hope it's
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
neither a boy or a chore to listen to me
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm grateful that i have a place to live
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
and i have an address and i'm not a
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
homeless person
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
we have homeless people that sneak in
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
and there are problems in there the big
 
04:45:19.030 --> 04:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
boss man of the building thomas he says
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%

me know
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
i see more than i want to know about
 
04:45:27.270 --> 04:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
there's people
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
selling drugs in there
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean just marijuana there's
 
04:45:34.868 --> 04:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
people selling heroin in there
 
04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%

house bill 7 16 17.
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%

04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.320 --> 04:47:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill has contacted me and
 
04:47:40.230 --> 04:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
likes to wants to with wants to withdraw
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
the bill

which you really can't do that we're
 
04:47:46.390 --> 04:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
this far along
 
04:47:46.400 --> 04:47:47.990 align:start position:0%
this far along
but

04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's probably not a good idea for us to
 
04:47:51.350 --> 04:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
put a lot of energy into it because
 
04:47:53.110 --> 04:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
what'll happen is when it gets to the
 
04:47:53.120 --> 04:47:54.150 align:start position:0%
what'll happen is when it gets to the
floor

04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
floor
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
the sponsor will will recommend that it
 
04:47:59.910 --> 04:47:59.920 align:start position:0%

04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that'll that'll give us a little
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.150 --> 04:48:22.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair so my question is
 
04:52:11.190 --> 04:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
with regard to the scheduled hearing for
 
04:52:14.550 --> 04:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
february 15th do you expect that there's
 
04:52:16.150 --> 04:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills that we're going to hear
 
04:52:17.190 --> 04:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
that day
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
and it's scheduled to i think the last
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
one is scheduled for three
 
04:52:24.550 --> 04:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
four four four
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
and there may be an additional bill as
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
well do you expect that will execute any
 
04:52:30.868 --> 04:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
bills on that day no
 
04:52:32.628 --> 04:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
i don't expect it but
 
04:52:34.470 --> 04:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be a long day
 
04:52:36.070 --> 04:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't expect that we're gonna get out of
 
04:52:39.030 --> 04:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
here in a half day and and
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
so you know uh
 
04:52:43.830 --> 04:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
we we've been sharing this room with two
 
04:52:43.840 --> 04:52:44.708 align:start position:0%
we we've been sharing this room with two
other

04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
committees and that's why we haven't
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
been able to get in here
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
two or three days a week
 
04:52:53.830 --> 04:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
and uh and bang our bills out
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
the other committees are essentially
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
done now
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're now we're playing
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
catch up
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
so are there any other dates besides the
 
04:53:04.400 --> 04:53:05.510 align:start position:0%
so are there any other dates besides the
15th

04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
15th
 
04:53:07.830 --> 04:53:07.840 align:start position:0%

04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
i've thought of an analogy
 
04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
to illustrate the difference between
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
recycling and compost
 
04:53:25.910 --> 04:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
you could think of me as being recycling
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
my friend trip
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
i don't get it do you care to expand
 
04:53:37.350 --> 04:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
upon that in some way that
 
04:53:40.868 --> 04:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:44.550 --> 04:53:44.560 align:start position:0%

05:00:41.670 --> 05:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
they know they have a problem there's a
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
problem with the email about the lagging
 
05:00:46.470 --> 05:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
but they said
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
just put out whatever you got at the
 
05:00:48.480 --> 05:00:49.270 align:start position:0%

05:01:05.190 --> 05:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
scheduling on that bill for votes
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%

okay members in the room like
representatives

representatives
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
should be addressed first they should
 
05:03:28.230 --> 05:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
get their chance to speak first they're
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
coming to testify yes yes because they
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
have to go to other hearings that's
 
05:03:34.788 --> 05:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
right that's where i've always been okay
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
um but yes i make the
 
05:03:38.320 --> 05:03:40.230 align:start position:0%
um but yes i make the
um

05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
the orange badge people testify last
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
they don't recommend that no really oh
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
no because then the last thing that
 
05:03:47.840 --> 05:03:49.110 align:start position:0%
no because then the last thing that
the

05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
hearing people have to hear what the
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
people at home have to hear
 
05:03:55.030 --> 05:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
is how they
 
05:03:56.628 --> 05:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
perceive the bill well they're opposed
 
05:03:57.750 --> 05:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
to support
 
05:03:57.760 --> 05:03:58.470 align:start position:0%
to support
so

05:03:58.470 --> 05:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:00.390 --> 05:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
you can do it two ways
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
he said you could put them in there and
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
shuffle up the cards and don't do
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
anything and what comes out comes out
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
or you can put them in there right after
 
05:04:10.310 --> 05:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
the representatives
 
05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
get them out of the way
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
that way
 
05:04:15.990 --> 05:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
the people that come in to testify
 
05:04:18.550 --> 05:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
can do that and then they testify on
 
05:04:20.310 --> 05:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
three minutes or two minutes
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean that is
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
exactly opposite of what they told us at
 
05:04:26.310 --> 05:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
the start of the year
 
05:04:27.750 --> 05:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
05:04:29.270 --> 05:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
be more
 
05:04:31.990 --> 05:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
polite and responsible for our citizens
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
and get them up first they want they
 
05:04:36.310 --> 05:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
want yeah they want you to be polite
 
05:04:37.670 --> 05:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the apparently they're running into
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
problems where
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
other people are late for meetings and
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
can't get there and whatever it is i'm a
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
good soldier i'll do whatever members in
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
the room should be addressed
 
05:04:50.240 --> 05:04:51.350 align:start position:0%
the room should be addressed
first

05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
